    <title>Google to use patient data to develop healthcare algorithms for hospital chain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KiU9vYl8QV8t92EJ_8B6jH5TwOo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345621/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6gjOu"&gt;Google has made a deal for access to patient records from HCA, which which &lt;a href="https://investor.hcahealthcare.com/news/news-details/2021/HCA-Healthcare-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"&gt;operates 181 hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and more than 2,000 healthcare sites in 21 states, so the tech company can develop healthcare algorithms, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-strikes-deal-with-hospital-chain-to-develop-healthcare-algorithms-11622030401"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGoAsz"&gt;Google will store anonymized data from patient health records and internet-connected medical devices. That data will be used to build programs that could inform medical decisions made by doctors. The deal is described as “multiyear” by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ, &lt;/em&gt;without specifying how many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAFLzj"&gt;As health records moved online over the past few years, hospitals and tech companies jumped at opportunities to take advantage of the glut of digitized medical information collected at each doctor’s visit. Microsoft and Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-give-tech-giants-access-to-detailed-medical-records-11579516200?mod=article_inline"&gt;also have deals&lt;/a&gt; with hospitals to analyze their patient information. Google previously partnered with healthcare system Ascension to gather patient records in a secretive project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959771/google-health-records-project-nightingale-privacy-ascension"&gt;called “Project Nightingale.”&lt;/a&gt; The company was criticized for starting in on the project without disclosing the work to patients and doctors. HCA is a major win for Google, since &lt;a href="https://hcahealthcare.com/util/forms/press-kit/HCA-presskit-fact-sheet-a.pdf"&gt;its facilities handle 5 percent of the hospital services provided in the US&lt;/a&gt; — around 30 million patient interactions each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="19J7ng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiSNXl"&gt;Along with using that data to develop algorithms, Google could also build healthcare tools independently and then pass them off to HCA to test on its own. “We want to push the boundaries of what the clinician can do in real time with data,” Chris Sakalosky, managing director of healthcare and life sciences at Google Cloud, told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnQUhk"&gt;Healthcare privacy laws in the US allow hospitals to share information with contractors and allow researchers to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/research/index.html"&gt;analyze patient data&lt;/a&gt; without express permission from those patients. Healthcare companies can use that information in any way they see fit, including to boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTdba4"&gt;HCA made $3.75 billion in profits during 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. National Nurses United &lt;a href="https://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/hca-safety-cuts-huge-profits-amid-pandemic"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in February that the company prioritized income over patient and staff safety. Nurses reported staff shortages and cutbacks on personal protective equipment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is making an electric Explorer, boosts EV investment by $8 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c6qA6s5pBbH4rlQS0ZeGgxDMGLs=/905x0:6220x3543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345598/All_New_Ford_E_Transit_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sPMEFK"&gt;Ford will spend $30 billion on electric vehicles by 2025, and says 40 percent of its global fleet will be all-electric by 2030. The company is working on an all-electric versions of its Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. And it’s developing two new electric vehicle platforms: one that will power full-size pickup trucks, and one that can easily flex between all- and rear-wheel drive to fit multiple vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlW9we"&gt;The company had previously committed $22 billion to EVs and had announced a goal to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;all-electric in Europe by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2dAvl"&gt;Ford is also creating a standalone business for its commercial vehicle division called Ford Pro. The company hopes that by offering more dedicated services to these customers, it can build on what is already a dominant position, as it makes up 43 percent of the commercial truck and van market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6h7iD"&gt;This barrage of announcements is part of a new business plan Ford has rolled out called Ford Plus, which the company says is all about creating “close, enduring customer relationships” that last beyond the purchase of a vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ES3u1e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new focus on “close, enduring customer relationships”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw14Ig"&gt;To do that, Ford spent a good chunk of time during an investor event on Wednesday talking about how it plans to make sure its future vehicles are fully networked, something it wants to do quickly. At one point, CEO Jim Farley said Ford plans to have more vehicles capable of being updated by over-the-air software updates than Tesla by mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU4b4J"&gt;Better-connected cars would let Ford offer things like more convenient mobile service, which could entice more customers to turn to the automaker when their cars need something fixed, for example. Connected services are also a big part of the plan for Ford’s commercial vehicle division. The company says it already has 160,000 customers that pay subscription fees for the advanced version of its fleet telematics offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s5Qmj"&gt;“We are reinventing our customer experience,” Alex Purdy, who runs Ford’s connectivity team, said during the event. “The path to winning [market share] requires daily interaction” with customers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9DOPp"&gt;“I cannot overstate the magnitude of the shift taking place at Ford,” Purdy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwElii"&gt;Ford Plus is yet another attempt to rethink Ford’s overall business, something the century-old automaker has spent a lot of time doing over the last few years. Its previous CEO, Jim Hackett, led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353950/ford-ceo-jim-hackett-retiring-replaced-restructuring"&gt;a major restructuring at the company in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that led to decisions like Ford shutting down its manufacturing efforts in Brazil and partnering with Volkswagen on autonomous, electric, and commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNXewu"&gt;The moves Hackett made are starting to pay off. Despite some early hiccups, the Mustang Mach-E is off to a strong start. Ford says 80 percent of customers are opting for the more expensive extended range battery versions, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408369/ford-mustang-mach-e-new-customers"&gt;70 percent overall are new to the brand&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, Ford shared that it has collected 70,000 deposits for the all-electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt; announced last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfUk4q"&gt;Ford Plus, then, is meant to build on that momentum. In addition to the aforementioned announcements, Ford also spent time Wednesday talking about how it plans to make its own battery packs in the US with South Korean manufacturer SK Innovation — a deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445688/ford-sk-innovation-ev-battery-production-joint-venture"&gt;it announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. The company will brand the lithium-ion packs for passenger vehicles as “IonBoost,” in a nod to its efficient EcoBoost engines. Lithium iron phosphate battery packs for commercial vehicles will be called IonBoost Pro. Ford is also developing solid state batteries and believes they will be ready by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEKXFm"&gt;Ford’s announcements come at a time of great change in the automotive industry. General Motors has said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;it hopes to only make zero-emission light duty vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;, and the Ford rival also recently spun out its own commercial vehicle (and vehicle services) business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;called BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnpWPY"&gt;“This is our biggest opportunity for growth and value creation since Henry Ford started to scale the Model T,” Farley said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edUWcR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lockheed Martin and GM are working on an electric Moon buggy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpPNqMddHRWIs31InlFeIzOEnCc=/466x0:5485x3346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345528/LM_GM_Lunar_Vehicles_teaser_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A company illustration shows astronauts staring at a fleet of conceptual lunar rovers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lockheed Martin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpdfPC"&gt;Lockheed Martin and General Motors unveiled plans on Wednesday to build an autonomous buggy-like vehicle that future astronauts can use to zip around the surface of the Moon. The two companies collaborated to pitch a conceptual Lunar Terrain Vehicle to NASA’s Artemis program, a Moon exploration campaign that calls for various robots, vehicles, and scientific bases to be planted on the lunar surface within the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I09IIE"&gt;Ahead of a presentation Wednesday morning, Lockheed and GM said in a joint press release that the vehicle will use the automaker’s autonomous driving technology and is “being designed to traverse significantly farther distances” than Apollo-era buggies. Just like those Moon buggies from the ‘70s, the Lockheed-GM concept will be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZVWCO"&gt;“These next-generation rovers will dramatically extend the range of astronauts as they perform high-priority science investigation on the Moon that will ultimately impact humanity’s understanding of our place in the solar system,” Rick Ambrose, executive vice president of Lockheed’s space unit, said in a statement. NASA’s Artemis program calls for an initial astronaut Moon landing as soon as 2024 (a goal some say is unrealistic) with follow-up missions to build a sustained presence on the lunar south pole. Those missions will serve as a proving ground for technologies that can inform future missions to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9IXked"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA’s Moon buggy requirements: fully electric, rugged, and autonomous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlBqeF"&gt;The heavyweight collaboration between Lockheed and GM came after NASA asked the private sector to come up with ideas for two types of human-rated Moon vehicles: the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (or LTV) and a bigger “Lunar Surface Science Mobility System,” essentially a science lab on wheels. NASA had only a few minimum specifications for LTV concepts. First, they should be capable of driving autonomously on the Moon’s hazardous, crater-laden terrain, a challenging environment for the computer vision technology that powers autonomous driving systems on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD5OCF"&gt;A NASA LTV also needs to be fully electric and capable of recharging itself internally — either from onboard solar arrays or other systems — and externally from infrastructure that can be set up on the Moon, like NASA’s Human Landing System. It should be able to carry two fully suited astronauts, including the driver, as well as any cargo for a total haul capacity of 1,102 pounds on a single charge for at least 1.2 miles. And it needs to withstand the lunar south pole’s volatile surface temperatures, which can vary from 260 degrees Fahrenheit to negative 280 degrees during the Moon’s nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C50V1lJUVpzHvlw4iZoYu-kpZuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540739/NASA_Apollo_17_Lunar_Roving_Vehicle.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wlekmc"&gt;Lockheed and GM were among the cadre of industry giants that built NASA’s first lunar landing systems and buggies under the Apollo program. GM built the chassis and wheels for the Lunar Roving Vehicles, as they were formally called, on Apollo missions 15 through 17. The rover for Apollo 17, the program’s final Moon mission in 1972, did the most roving: Astronaut Gene Cernan whipped the lightweight electric LRV more than 22 miles total on the Moon, going as far as 4.7 miles away from their lunar module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1YLhH"&gt;Lockheed and GM said their new concept will travel much farther than the buggies of Apollo. “The result” of the companies’ engineering efforts, a press release said, “may allow astronauts to explore the lunar surface in unprecedented fashion and support discovery in places where humans have never gone before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuJxdw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbXaJR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More Americans believe in climate change but still can’t quit fossil fuels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activists demand senate pass ‘Green New Deal’ Resolution" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUlYUdM89l_JnBmaMcjzmsMioWc=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345257/1133036440.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GLLqC"&gt;Nearly two-thirds of Americans now believe that climate change is an urgent problem to address, but they aren’t nearly as enthusiastic about giving up oil and gas, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Pew Research Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNCsqO"&gt;Only one-third of people surveyed supported completely phasing out fossil fuels. Less than half of respondents are okay with phasing out new gas-powered vehicles. Taking those steps might seem drastic, considering fossil fuels currently&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;make up about 80 percent of the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/"&gt;US energy mix&lt;/a&gt;. But phasing out most, if not all, fossil fuels is pretty much in line with what’s needed to meet the scale of the climate crisis, according to climate experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5d6ue"&gt;Now that many Americans are taking the threats posed by climate change seriously, the next hurdle for climate activists and policymakers is getting more of them on board for the swift action it will take to limit the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aY81J4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Attitudes towards climate change are hardly a predictor of policy support”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OqNwOs"&gt;“This is the divide between attitudes and action,” says Chenyang Xiao, a sociology professor at American University who studies environmental beliefs. “Attitudes towards climate change are hardly a predictor of policy support or pro-environmental actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcIrie"&gt;A more gradual shift away from fossil fuels may be something most Americans can get on board with. About 70 percent of people surveyed agreed that future fossil fuel expansion should take a back seat to developing alternative energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hourcD"&gt;Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels need to drop dramatically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by the middle of the century, &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;according to leading climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;. They’re aiming for “net-zero” — the point where global emissions match up with the amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere, after making major reductions to fossil fuel use.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Otherwise, say goodbye to 99 percent of the world’s coral reefs and hello to more extreme heat, hunger, and flooded coastlines. In most scenarios, meeting the net-zero goal involves using less energy and swapping out most or all fossil fuels for renewables like wind and solar or carbon-free energy like nuclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qHZKO"&gt;There’s a little more allowance for continued emissions from heavy industry like steel and for ships and planes that are hard to electrify. Those sources of pollution might be paired with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404056/climate-tech-joe-biden-summit-carbon-capture-green-hydrogen"&gt;emerging technologies&lt;/a&gt; that can capture and store the planet-heating CO2 they produce. But reaching net-zero greenhouse gas pollution requires no new fossil fuel development past 2021 and no more sales of gas-powered vehicles past 2035, a major &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits-according-to-iea-special-report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the International Energy Agency recently found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yTKIOk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Political affiliations are the biggest driving factor behind the beliefs people have of climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YWC2zl"&gt;Unfortunately, attitudes toward climate change and environmental policy in the US don’t tend to be influenced by actual science and data. &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/21/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts/"&gt;Historically&lt;/a&gt;, political affiliations are the biggest driving factor behind the beliefs people have of climate change. But in the last couple decades, Americans have swung further left politically — although they might consider themselves “moderates” rather than “liberals,” according to Xiao. That could be why a growing number of people are at least taking climate change seriously, even after years of &lt;a href="https://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/"&gt;disinformation from fossil fuel industries&lt;/a&gt; and the politicians they bankroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNKi9w"&gt;A little over a year ago, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/"&gt;52 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans saw climate change as a top priority. That’s now up to 64 percent of the 13,749 adults that the Pew Research Center surveyed in April. Xiao also says that most people now have a better understanding of climate change than they have in the past. Nearly a third of people surveyed who use social media said that they’ve engaged with content about climate change on the platforms they use — including following accounts focused on climate action and posting about climate change on their own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="er6vgh"&gt;“It used to be a small majority [that saw climate change as a top priority and] now, it’s a strong majority. I’m hopeful this kind of change can amount to the point that we may be able to start a social movement,” Xiao says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roVaCs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbjQVE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sweet Tooth’s post-apocalyptic world is meant to be a ‘storybook dystopia’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sweet Tooth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ymQ4ISwGyqF38yelfVW7-yxxCtM=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69345107/sto105_nf_pull_02a_20210412R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tq3UIB"&gt;Jeff Lemire’s &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a comic book about a young boy surviving in a world ravaged by a pandemic. He also happens to be a “hybrid,” a new breed of half-human, half-animal creature that began to appear alongside the deadly sickness. It’s a dark story, one that had the potential to be incredibly bleak and uncomfortable when translated to television. That’s particularly true now, as the real world continues to deal with its own pandemic. For the team adapting the story for an upcoming series on Netflix, all of these factors combined to create a slightly different approach. “It made us lean more into the hope,” executive producer Amanda Burrell says of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Mwbd"&gt;Netflix’s eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; series will debut on June 4th. It’s a live-action take on the comics, one that maintains the same basic premise: Gus, a nine-year-old boy with deer antlers, lives in relative isolation with his father, before eventually setting out into the larger world alongside a wanderer named Jepperd. (There are other changes, but they venture into spoiler territory.) Aside from the move to live-action, one of the biggest shifts is pacing. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a real page-turner in comic book form, but the show moves much more leisurely, lingering on key moments. That’s by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iMAOrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to draw things out a bit more.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SiBv5B"&gt;“We wanted to draw things out a bit more,” explains Burrell. “We wanted to give more time to Gus and Jepperd together. We wanted to slow down and ensure we were really inside all of the characters.” This also gives the show time to steadily introduce some of the more fantastical concepts, like the hybrids themselves, as early on, the focus is almost entirely on Gus. “We really wanted to slowly get the audience on board with this very specific type of new human, and really get them emotionally invested in Gus before opening it up too wide,” Burrell adds. “It was an intentional thing. We want the audience to be with these characters and not removed from them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LyXTVQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWqS7n"&gt;This focus on Gus is also where that hope comes from. The boy, played by Christian Convery, has a wide-eyed optimism that’s easy to get caught up in, particularly when it’s played against Jepperd’s cynicism. In fact, there’s almost a schism in the show, where the younger characters seem able to deal with the state of the world in a much more positive way compared to the adults. So even if there are incredibly dark moments, there’s a sense of balance. “We wanted to make sure that humanity wasn’t depicted in just such a dark, foreboding way,” Burrell says, adding, “We talked a lot about not wanting audiences to be alienated by the world. That kind of hopeless feeling you get after you watch a show that has a bleakness to it. Then it was just about leaning into Gus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FHxNa5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We talked a lot about not wanting audiences to be alienated by the world.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8jt2N"&gt;She describes the show’s vibe as a “storybook dystopia,” a feeling that was enhanced by filming in New Zealand. (The story is set in the US.) “We went to New Zealand, and it has this kind of heightened magic to it,” Burrell says. “The trees look slightly different, the mountains are bigger. It allowed us to really accentuate the beauty of nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IuhnP"&gt;The pilot for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; was filmed in 2019, before the current pandemic, and it wasn’t until it came time to write the rest of the season that “the world went nuts,” as Burrell describes it. The real-world pandemic had some influence over the show’s comparatively lighter tone, though it didn’t alter the actual story in any way. That said, Burrell notes that a tension could be felt during filming, particularly during one scene (which I won’t spoil) that feels eerily familiar after a 2020 filled with lockdowns and quarantines. “On set, you could hear a pin drop,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eoVzSe"&gt;This all raises an interesting question: why are people drawn to these stories, particularly as they more closely resemble our own reality (deer children aside)? The last year has seen major releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"&gt;the grim &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s take on the Stephen King classic &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2021/2/11/22277486/the-stand-new-ending-stephen-king"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the surprising heartwarming film &lt;em&gt;Love and Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, to name just a few. Burrell has a theory as to why this kind of post-apocalyptic setting continues to resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xoAWJ"&gt;“There’s a tension to: what if it’s all over? I think the idea of the human spirit and the future, wrestling back constantly, is just so powerful,” she explains. “&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;is a great example. Seeing what humans are willing to do for one another; obviously it can get very dark, like in that instance. But it’s just really powerful to see what people do for one another. I think now more than ever we need to feel that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cannes Lions 2016 : Day Three" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bfk2crChBha7uSq6mk6F3I1qD4=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344919/541787196.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJa8tz"&gt;Airbnb doesn’t want you to forget about Airbnb, especially when you’re planning post-pandemic vacations. So on Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2F2021&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made multiple announcements&lt;/a&gt; all seemingly designed to get people renting, traveling, and, crucially, choosing Airbnb to do so. It announced flexible booking, which lets people search across days, weeks, or months to plan a trip, as well as more location flexibility when looking for a place to stay. It also launched a faster onboarding process for hosts, during a time when competitors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vrbo-isnt-airbnbs-problem-11621510202"&gt;like Vrbo&lt;/a&gt; are trying to poach them, as well as a new service for Super Hosts that’ll allow them to reach out to the Airbnb team directly for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGOYoA"&gt;“We just think there’s this huge inflection point in travel brought on by the pandemic,” Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And so we wanted to adapt our service to this changing world and kind of really ride this wave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgARri"&gt;At the same time, Airbnb is expanding its idea of travel beyond short vacations. Chesky says that nearly a quarter of Airbnb bookings are “long term,” or 28 days and longer. “Millions and millions of people” are staying and living at Airbnb listings on a monthly basis, he says, and in cities like New York, that figure is more like 60 percent. He views this as a a shift from travel to “living,” which has been propelled by people “discovering they do not need to be tethered to one location to live and work,” per the company’s &lt;a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Airbnb_Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnj2Sx"&gt;“I think eventually in the future people will start paying for rent the way they pay for cable television, or for Netflix, you pay on a month-to-month basis,” he says. He didn’t mention how this could impact tenants, like those who prefer long-term rentals because it locks in their rent at a set price and offers legal protections. The idea is that more people are going to want flexibility and the ability to parachute into a destination and live like a local. Chesky says that Airbnb has dealt with evictions and squatters in the past and hasn’t found any “intractable issue” that can’t be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZRhxk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nearly a quarter of Airbnb bookings are for 28 days or longer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F6h8ii"&gt;That shift to long-term rentals doesn’t mean the business is changing how it vets guests, though. It won’t make renters prove income, submit a credit score, or leave a deposit of first and last month’s rent for longer stays, like traditional landlords require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19ABsv"&gt;“I think that’s all anachronistic and going to eventually go away,” Chesky says, pointing to Airbnb’s prepay model as secure enough backing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw8aJQ"&gt;“So almost all this old system of renting, you don’t need to do anymore,” he says. “That is stuff that was invented before the technology allowed almost all this to be automated. It’s like using a rotary dial phone, suddenly we have smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SRbEH"&gt;He says Airbnb’s Trust and Safety team is “more sophisticated” than what landlords use and that eventually, people will prefer not to sign one-year leases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yijmxR"&gt;For price-conscious renters, he notes that the company is reexamining how fees on its platform work, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-trending-twitter-customers-complain-host-cleaning-fees-rules-price-2021-5"&gt;a flurry of complaints&lt;/a&gt; about exorbitant cleaning fees. The team is refining their algorithm to determine the “best deal” for renters that takes fees into account, along with asking hosts and guests for their input on how to make fees work for everyone. Their solve will be coming out “later this year” he says, without offering details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze names former Hotwire president Neha Parikh as CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NpZQuic1EO3-b46f9lMWzf4rQE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344870/akrales_160517_1059_A_0113.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkqXaJ"&gt;Waze has a new CEO: Neha Parikh, the former president of Hotwire and a board member of Carvana. Parikh replaces Noam Bardin, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of the Google-owned navigation service last November after leading the company for 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epDlZ"&gt;Parikh will join Waze as CEO starting in June, the company says. She is a veteran of online hospitality brand Expedia, having served in a variety of positions at two of the corporation’s subsidiaries: Hotels.com, where she ended as senior vice president for global brands and retails, and flight and hotel booking service Hotwire, where she is currently president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTWlU"&gt;As Hotwire’s youngest and first female president, Parikh “led a return to growth by revamping the business model, reshaping the product, and rebuilding the team and culture,” Waze says. The aim is for her to do the same at Waze. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hu6K7GkuBYFnpXyvwVhuM785U1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539998/Neha_Parikh_2019.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neha Parikh is the youngest and first female president of Hotwire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7KERje"&gt;“As Neha leads Waze into the future, she will remain hyper-focused on our passionate community, beloved brand, and best-in-class products,” a spokesperson for the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1HF0Q"&gt;She was appointed to the board of Carvana in April 2019. The online car marketplace praised Parikh for her focus on customer service. “On my first visit to the Carvana offices, I took a picture of their prominently displayed values, one of which is ‘Your next customer may be your mom,’ which I love,” &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190422005543/en/Carvana-Adds-Neha-Parikh-President-of-Hotwire-to-Board-of-Directors"&gt;she said in the press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Relentless customer focus has been central to my career, so I’m thrilled to align with a company that puts their customers first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmqQwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Relentless customer focus has been central to my career”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="baXB1A"&gt;Waze was founded in Israel in 2008 by Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar, and Uri Levine. The crowdsourced navigation app quickly grew in popularity, praised for its ability to take into account traffic and construction in real time. The app quickly emerged as a top choice among Uber and Lyft drivers. And today, it has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KYgAa"&gt;The company was acquired by Google in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion. And the app continued to flourish, as Google refrained from absorbing it into its Maps division and allowed it to stay independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ma18X"&gt;Like most companies, Waze hit a rough patch during the pandemic. Its number of monthly active users, or the number of customers using the app each month, and driven kilometers, the metric by which the company measures how far its customers drive while using Waze, both decreased significantly. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;laid off 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of its global workforce, or 30 people, in September. Its nascent Carpool service was hit especially hard, as people stopped commuting to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMR7lE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open-world RPG Pokémon Legends: Arceus is launching January 28th, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g64PMho72s9zQBWQ1R2ecbLzm-g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344706/Switch_PokemonLegendsArceus_Screenshot__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJVRpG"&gt;Possibly the most ambitious &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game to date will be available early next year. Today &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1397539085921800194"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on January 28th, 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;The game was first announced in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECigw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; looks to be a big change for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, a franchise that’s become known for its slowly evolving roleplaying games. It’s an open-world RPG that takes place in a much older version of the Sinnoh region, before the time of pokémon trainers and organized competitions. In addition to the new setting, the experience also looks to be much more seamless compared to the main games, as Nintendo says players will be able to go out into the wild to “study the pokémon’s behaviors, sneak up to them, then throw poké balls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS8HW9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only major &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; title in the works. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Nintendo recently released a modern version of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are coming to the Switch on November 11th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1397543238580547590"&gt;which the company also announced today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwbQvj1_XrGbBaO54-q2kLj4b3I=/40x0:1660x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344538/IG_Hiding_Likes__Consumer_View_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8k7TKT"&gt;You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook. After years of testing on both platforms, Facebook and Instagram have settled on an opt-in experience for hiding like counts to allow people to disable seeing them across all posts and an option to hide their own public like counts from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYfAa7"&gt;Instagram is enabling this feature after years of tests and pressure from experts to make changes to its platform. The service was ranked as “the most detrimental to young people’s mental health and wellbeing” in a &lt;a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/instagram-ranked-worst-for-young-people-s-mental-health.html"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by the Royal Society for Public Health UK. &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-removing-likes-from-instagram-could-affect-our-mental-health"&gt;Experts have argued&lt;/a&gt; that removing a like button or like counts could help reduce anxiety and social pressures for some Facebook and Instagram users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcSjNO"&gt;“We tested hiding like counts to see if it might depressurize people’s experience on Instagram,” says an Instagram spokesperson. “What we heard from people and experts was that not seeing like counts was beneficial for some, and annoying to others, particularly because people use like counts to get a sense for what’s trending or popular, so we’re giving you the choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gHOgYucb6dNkd5codKvIet0WQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540453/FB_Hiding_Likes_Mock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to hide Facebook like counts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ImiIQ0"&gt;You’ll now be able to toggle an option to hide all like counts on all posts in your feed on both Instagram and Facebook today. A separate option will let you hide your own like counts to others. You can also hide like counts on a per-post basis on Instagram, so there’s a little more flexibility to allow people to focus on the content of posts rather than the like counts. Facebook will get these same per-post controls in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFTnt9"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885990/facebook-hide-public-like-count-test-user-experience-australia"&gt;first started testing hidden like counts&lt;/a&gt; in September 2019 as an experiment to see if the change would improve the experience of using the platform. Instagram has also been testing a variety of ways to hide like counts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;recent years&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382692/instagram-public-like-count-test-expand"&gt;test for this same optional feature&lt;/a&gt; just last month.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It will delight you even as you question its need to exist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6hgAsF"&gt;I spent the entire run of Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; torn between delight and horror. Rarely has a film so neatly emotionally vivisected me as this one about a villain best known for &lt;em&gt;wanting to skin puppies to make a coat&lt;/em&gt;. Only &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; isn’t about that character really. It’s not about her war with the fur industry or PETA. It’s definitely not about a collection of Dalmatian dogs fleeing her furrier desires. It’s a colorful and pulpy tale of a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. I’m sorry if you ever thought, “I could never have anything but camp-fueled affection for Disney’s puppy killer” because this gal is a delight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7hOpW"&gt;This is more &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;in that it reimagines a notorious villain as a misunderstood hero besmirched by popular media. Yet I have no idea &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;it is a movie about Cruella de Vil and not simply an original film about a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. Where &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; (both the book and the musical) takes pains to explore how media can corrupt an image, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; largely sidesteps jibes about populism or media to just put on a big fabulous show.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma Stone looks fabulous 90 percent of the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tFby7K"&gt;Plus, apart from the occasional cameo from Roger (played by a wonderfully schluppy-looking Kayvan Novak), Anita (a perky but sly Kirby Howell-Baptiste), and some black-and-white spotted pups, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; has nothing to do with any of its source material. &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; at least took us to the natural end of the story after building up its hero. I’m not saying I needed to see Emma Stone skin 101 puppies, but at least then the focus on Cruella would have made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrkqgW"&gt;In every lull in the film I found myself trying to figure out why exactly &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; exists, entertaining as it is. One colleague jokingly told me he thinks it was made because Disney made some digital dog tech from &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp&lt;/em&gt; and wanted to get the most out of it. To his credit, there are a lot of dogs running between Emma Stone's legs and leaping over her and generally being adorable in &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;. There are even a few Dalmatians! They all look realistic and pettable until the uncanny valley occasionally catches them in its maw and you are reminded that those are some very fake dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBgrgY"&gt;And even if this film &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; greenlit as some bean counter’s way of making back the cash spent to produce the tech for &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp,&lt;/em&gt; it still means that somewhere once upon a time some Disney execs were sitting in their office, legs up on the desk, tasteful Mickey Mouse-branded socks peeking out from between expensively tailored pants and more expensive shoes, and looking at this pitch, saying “sure, let’s reimagine the story of that villain who really has no redeemable quality apart from her taste in cars as a misunderstood antisocial heroine just out to resolve some true injustices in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This woman was previously on fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iyLjtl"&gt;At no point does the film attempt to explain — or even hint — at how Cruella would turn from a fashion icon with a very deeply buried heart of gold into a monster forcing her friends to kidnap puppies from another friend and to make a coat. It starts with Cruella, then called Estella, going to school, causing trouble, and being doted on by her exceptionally nice mother. After a murder that Cruella blames herself for, she flees into the streets of London and meets two young thieves, Jasper and Horace. She dyes her distinguishable hair and joins them in their heist and the three become a family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6XOlx"&gt;But as much as Estella loves crime, her true passion is &lt;em&gt;fashion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaDvSf"&gt;We then shoot forward 10 years to an otherworldly version of ‘70s London. Estella’s adoptive brothers (Joel Fry gives Jasper heart even as Paul Walter Hauser happily plays Horace as a cartoon) get her a job at a high-end store in the hopes she’ll wow them with her skills as a designer and seamstress. And while she enrages her bosses, she catches the eye of the Baroness (Emma Thompson), the biggest and most powerful designer in London. Estella then is torn between a desire to prove herself to the Baroness and to destroy the Baroness, and the movie quickly becomes scene after scene of guerilla fashion shows framed like the most gorgeous-looking heists you’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Emma Thompson will be compared to Meryl Streep in &lt;/em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;em&gt;. The comparison will be well earned.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2HGWfo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; borders on camp with the way it hops between absurdity and melodrama — often in the same scene. I questioned if I was stoned as Cruella raced across London in a dump truck after charging a one-eyed Chihuahua with a jailbreak. Not because it was silly (it was!) but because it was played deadly seriously. Stone and Thompson anchor the whole affair with cartoonish characters treated with the gravitas of historical figures. They do not wink at the camera. They do not make sly referential jokes about the story material. They just go to war with flaming dresses and shimmering moth cocoons and the occasional blow of a dog whistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="J7eQ60"&gt;You usually know when you’re supposed to laugh and when you’re just supposed to enjoy yourself watching a movie, but I found myself torn constantly by &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;. It's like a fairy tale, and it's like a really good graphic novel, and it's unlike any of the films it will get compared to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LD2MF8"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cruella &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1073148/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fcruella%2F2GJTZuO8I01c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; Friday, May 28th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
