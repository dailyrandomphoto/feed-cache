    <title>NASA’s tiny electrical aircraft is almost ready for lift-off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Darx8gJE9AfX7uFRe5tBJU8yBaU=/0x1:1920x1281/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026061/Mod_2_motor_testing.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6vGojW"&gt;NASA’s first electric plane is getting ready for takeoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJXfnj"&gt;For the last five years, a small team of NASA engineers has been working to convert an Italian Tecnam P2006T aircraft so that it runs only on battery power. The X-57 Maxwell, named after 19th-century Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, recently began &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/newsreleases/2021/21-01NR.html"&gt;high-voltage functional ground testing&lt;/a&gt; at the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, Calif., and is set to take its inaugural flight in the spring of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3egI4"&gt;That flight, when it happens, will signal a crucial milestone for NASA, which has been tasked by President Joe Biden to &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/10/nasa-preparing-climate-change-space-infrastructure-michael-mann/"&gt;focus more of its resources&lt;/a&gt; on lessening the impact of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oOqEI"&gt;NASA Administrator Bill Nelson toured Armstrong last week, where he got an up-close look at the tiny two-seater aircraft. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Nelson said that the technology that underpins the X-57 will be crucial in the effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mM3VHO"&gt;“They’re getting ready to fly this,” Nelson said. “And it is the first demonstrator of an all-electric [airplane].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ext3iv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re getting ready to fly this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zpnI9U"&gt;In concept form, the X-57 has a unique look. (&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;called it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/nasas-new-electric-plane-looks-goofy-packs-sweet-tech/"&gt;“goofy as hell”&lt;/a&gt; back in 2016.) The high-aspect-ratio wings are much skinnier than typical airplane wings, lined with 12 electric motors with propellers to help with lift and two larger engines at the end to aid cruising. When not in use, the 12 smaller motors fold in to help reduce drag. NASA expects the X-57 will have a range of roughly 100 miles and a cruise speed of 172 mph. It will also have a maximum flight time of approximately 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tRHjF"&gt;But in reality, the motors have yet to be installed, and the X-57 still looks like a normal light aircraft that you might see at any airfield. Nelson said the prototype will soon “morph” into the image of the plane that NASA first revealed back in 2016. And from there, the team will build a hybrid version that can run on both electricity and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiTkg6"&gt;“All of which has the purpose of lessening our reliance on fossil fuels, less pollution, and keeping the cost reasonable,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRkFuxTdGamk9gDY1IgIFqKUDuA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944636/Mod_4_in_flight_concept_image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The X-57 in concept form.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szxe22"&gt;One of the main obstacles standing in the way of electric aviation is the weight of the battery. Energy density — the amount of energy stored in a battery — is the key metric, and today’s batteries don’t contain enough energy to get most planes off the ground &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;sustain flight beyond more than a few hundred miles. To weigh it out: jet fuel doles out about 43 times more energy than a battery that’s just as heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9xRkI"&gt;The X-57 requires about 800 pounds of battery for its research flights, said Sean Clark, principal investigator at Armstrong Flight Research Center. One of the innovations developed by the X-57 team was an installation pack that can absorb a failed battery cell after its energy is spent, which helps prevent the failure of an entire battery pack. This experimental installation pack is already being commercialized and used by NASA’s contractors. “You have to be prepared for failures,” Clark said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIraig"&gt;Most companies working on electric aircraft say their prototypes will be useful for short trips within a city, like from Lower Manhattan to JFK Airport. Nelson said these air taxis could prove useful in reducing the amount of surface congestion on urban roadways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N0cGGx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to be prepared for failures”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Il8VV9"&gt;“You could have short-hop aircraft ... between cities that are not far apart,” he said. “However, you could even have intracity in a large city like Los Angeles, going from one part of Los Angeles, taking passengers to another, and avoid having to get in the four o’clock traffic jam on the freeways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxSbKF"&gt;The aviation industry only produces about 2 percent of global carbon emissions. But the effort to remove the noise and pollution from flying is (pardon the pun) really taking off in a variety of ways. Figuring out how to swap jet fuel with heavy lithium-ion batteries has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17686706/electric-airplane-flying-car-battery-weight-green-energy-travel"&gt;a huge sticking point&lt;/a&gt; — one that NASA’s team of scientists and engineers feel well suited to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATn-qkgQMLIaZH1JNOX8C0YTDHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944638/AFRC2021_0128_43.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy in front of the X-57 Maxwell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nRNC2q"&gt;“Are we gonna be serious about trying to save the planet?” Nelson said. “There are a lot of other things that pollute a lot more, namely coal-fired electrical plants. But the fact is we’ve got to work on them all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxXBl2"&gt;Clark said that NASA has already made huge advances in battery technology that will help the aircraft achieve lift and sustain a cruising altitude. The X-57 team’s development of battery technology, along with the packaging of energy storage into the fuselage putting the motors, has been valuable, along with figuring out a process for performing “health checks” on the battery and motors while in flight, Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uEOsk"&gt;Those details are being published and shared with the aviation community to help inform their own efforts. “Even before the first flight, we’re able to help support this new industry and kickstart this new technology,” Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oWuiA"&gt;It’s still early days for electric aircraft, but the companies developing prototypes have already conducted their own test flights. NASA wants it to be a two-way street: you share data with us, and we’ll share our learnings, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hJK4yY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Even before the first flight, we’re able to help support this new industry and kickstart this new technology”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bOzX9a"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651998/nasa-joby-evtol-test-flight-air-taxi"&gt;NASA kicked off test flights of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft with Joby Aviation&lt;/a&gt;, the Northern California company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;recently went public&lt;/a&gt;. The agency is closely monitoring the aircraft’s sound profile to see how well it compares to helicopters and other gas-powered vehicles. A major selling point for eVTOL companies is that these aircraft are noticeably less noisy than helicopters and therefore better suited for flights over populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1om5ns"&gt;The test flights are part of a national campaign by NASA to observe these experimental aircraft in action and gather data. Joby, which was founded in 2009, is the first eVTOL company to participate in &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/aamnationalcampaign"&gt;NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) National Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCTniB"&gt;NASA is getting data from Joby, and in exchange, the company has supplied components to the X-57 project, such as its electric motors, Clark said. If this collaboration continues to bear fruit, people may find themselves whisking through in an electric aircraft sooner than they think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTzfzB"&gt;“It’s really important that we support the industry and make this technology accessible to Joby and other airframe manufacturers,” Clark said, “to make these aircraft more accessible to the flying public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjAeMP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Nova 9 is its latest smartphone to launch globally sans Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sb-RDQcjHh7R152PgcdWDuFZNTI=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025998/huawei_nova_9_1_mob_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s Nova 9.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2z0MQ4"&gt;Huawei’s Nova 9 is getting a global launch just under a month after the phone was &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_nova_9_series_announced_with_snapdragon_778g_4g_chipsets_up_to_100w_charging_-news-51106.php"&gt;announced for the Chinese market&lt;/a&gt;, the company said today. Huawei characterizes the Nova 9 as a “flagship smartphone for the younger generation,” compared to its Mate series (high-tech and premium) and P-series (photography) lineups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY7tmv"&gt;The company also gave an update on the global release status of the P50, the flagship phone Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;announced for the domestic Chinese market in July&lt;/a&gt;. The company says the P50 will release outside of China in 2022, which will come roughly two years after the release of its predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21278958/huawei-p40-pro-review-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;P40&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYXQMz"&gt;Thanks to Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;ongoing presence on the USA’s entity list&lt;/a&gt;, the Nova 9 will once again ship without Google’s apps or services, including the Google Play Store, which will severely limit its appeal outside of China. Instead, it runs Huawei’s Harmony OS-branded software, which shares a lot of similarities with the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;open-source version of Android&lt;/a&gt;, only with Huawei’s apps, services, and app store replacing Google’s versions. The P50 will likely suffer the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwemAqXW6RzbgNA1lw79gtoUNvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941587/huawei_nova_9_pro_colours_4_mob_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nova 9 is launching globally in black and blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FXwqpr"&gt;The Nova 9 is powered by a Snapdragon 778G rather than one of Huawei’s in-house Kirin chips, following the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;problems with Kirin production&lt;/a&gt;. Around back, there’s an array of four cameras: a 50-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro. Meanwhile, on the front you’ll find a 32-megapixel selfie camera inside a hole-punch notch in its 1080p, 120Hz 6.57-inch curved OLED display. Its 4,300mAh battery can be fast charged at 66W, which Huawei says should refill its battery in 38 minutes. There’s no mention of 5G support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0APqNr"&gt;Huawei declined to provide exact pricing, release markets, or specific dates prior to publication, but we’ll update this post when we hear more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ug6ytf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board says Facebook wasn’t ‘fully forthcoming’ about Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HB_2uzdjOPGWOAfyPJfed4nF6vs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025957/mdoying_180411_2400_0045still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE5Cnd"&gt;The Facebook Oversight Board says it will review &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671565/facebook-xcheck-moderation-system-high-profile-exemptions"&gt;Facebook’s “cross-check” program&lt;/a&gt; for high-profile users and criticized it for not disclosing enough information about the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHNmN9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/215139350722703-oversight-board-demands-more-transparency-from-facebook/"&gt;In a new transparency report&lt;/a&gt;, the Oversight Board — a semi-independent body that reviews Facebook’s moderation process — publicly accepted a Facebook request to review cross-check (sometimes called “XCheck”) and recommend changes. Facebook will also share documents related to reporting &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=hp_lead_pos7"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which described cross-check as a system that “shields millions of VIP users from the company’s normal enforcement process.” The board previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686364/facebook-oversight-board-xcheck-moderation-exemption"&gt;raised concerns about cross-check&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEjOKi"&gt;“In the board’s view, the team within Facebook tasked to provide information has not been fully forthcoming in its responses on cross-check. On some occasions, Facebook failed to provide relevant information to the board, while in other instances, the information it did provide was incomplete,” the board report says. The board says its “credibility” depends on being able to trust that Facebook’s information is “accurate, comprehensive, and paints a full picture of the topic at hand” — and a lack of disclosure undermines that credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yTyVcM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The board says its credibility relies on Facebook’s trustworthiness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jr3xXb"&gt;The board calls it “not acceptable” that Facebook didn’t initially mention cross-check was a factor in its moderation of former President Donald Trump, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;banned for violating Facebook’s policies&lt;/a&gt; against inciting violence. It also says that Facebook should not have referred to cross-check as covering a “small number of decisions” when its true scope was clearly far wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lbTn0"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/requesting-oversight-board-guidance-cross-check-system/"&gt;asked the board for guidance&lt;/a&gt; on cross-check in late September, and the board says it will now reach out to academics, researchers, and former Facebook employees who have come forward as whistleblowers. It will also open a public comment period in the coming days, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;something it also did&lt;/a&gt; around the Trump ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYeqoP"&gt;The transparency report is the first of its kind, although the Oversight Board says it will now release these reports quarterly. It offers a sense of the program’s scope compared to the massive demand for its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzBaF3"&gt;Facebook and Instagram users submitted around 524,000 total requests for review between October 2020 and June 2021. The requests were particularly concentrated in the US and Canada, where a combined total of roughly 46 percent originated. This doesn’t reflect the overall demographic makeup of Facebook, and the board says it will conduct more outreach to draw reports from other areas — saying that “if anything, we have reason to believe that users in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East experience more, not fewer, problems with Facebook than parts of the world with more appeals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXVNfR"&gt;Either way, that volume is orders of magnitude greater than the number of cases the Oversight Board actually takes up. It decided 11 cases in the first and second quarters of 2021, and its review process caused Facebook to identify 38 cases where it had made an incorrect moderation decision, apparently leading it to restore around 35 pieces of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KiaO2"&gt;The Oversight Board recommendations can have a larger indirect effect by leading Facebook to review and modify its policies — in at least one case, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568648/facebook-oversight-board-abdullah-ocalan-dangerous-entities-exception-lost"&gt;rediscovered a policy it had lost&lt;/a&gt;. And one of the transparency report’s themes is that Facebook should be more transparent with &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt; as well. “In areas where we feel that Facebook is falling short, such as transparency, we will keep challenging the company to do better,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku calls out Google over YouTube contract stalemate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDXz5UnZzmDFuAoumDbn832oXIY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025930/cwelch_181128_3103_0677_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R77EXb"&gt;Tensions between Roku and Google spilled over to customers in a new blog posted by the streaming service on Thursday. After months of failed negotiations for Roku to maintain the YouTube app, the company is accusing Google of anti-competitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIX9YD"&gt;Responding to the deadlocked negotiations, Google said that it would end all distribution of YouTube on new Roku devices after December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AJq23"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its Thursday blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Roku accused Google of making anti-competitive demands in carriage agreements, like requiring Roku to implement a dedicated YouTube search results row in the Roku interface. Roku also alleged that Google overrides music voice search and blocks relevant searches outside of YouTube’s own results while users are in the YouTube app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLD5XS"&gt;“Doing business with an enterprise as powerful as Google creates complex challenges,” the blog post said. “Importantly, our concerns with Google are not about money. We have not asked for a single change in the financial terms of our existing agreement. In fact, Roku does not earn a single dollar from YouTube’s ad supported video sharing service today, whereas Google makes hundreds of millions of dollars from the YouTube app on Roku.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZoqVB"&gt;Outside of these demands being hostile to consumers, Roku also alleged that Google’s requirements give it access to vast amounts of consumer data related to what Roku users watch on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLp2bb"&gt;Roku’s deal to distribute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;the YouTube TV app expired in April&lt;/a&gt; and the company removed the app from its store after failing to reach a new agreement with Google. Roku has consistently accused Google of making unfair demands while not requiring similar data-sharing and search features on other platforms like Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMxugc"&gt;“Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYp5b"&gt;The blog comes just a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726897/amazon-apple-google-app-stores-marketplace-antitrust-competition-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;a new bipartisan bill to combat anti-competitive&lt;/a&gt; behavior in the tech industry was introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA). The American Innovation and Choice Online Act would ban similar behaviors alleged by Roku in its Thursday blog, like self-preferencing and discriminating against competitors’ content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2w4be"&gt;“Roku supports bipartisan efforts such as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act to modernize our competition laws, promote innovation, and protect consumers in the Digital Age,” said John Kelly, Roku senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications at Roku in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/support-builds-for-bipartisan-legislation-from-klobuchar-grassley-and-colleagues-to-rein-in-big-tech"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBzllf"&gt;Roku told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Wednesday that company representatives were in contact with lawmakers over these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pesJzu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10/21/19 at 11:08AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Series S and X get new 512GB and 2TB storage expansion card options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sqOrLxw9YLaKaH94l6YcmyFlrU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025817/Seagate_SEC_Family.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New 2TB and 512GB storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UnP6gE"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/new-seagate-storage-expansion-cards/"&gt;announcing new storage expansion card&lt;/a&gt; options for the Xbox Series X / S today. Made by Seagate, there will now be a smaller 512GB card priced at $139.99 and a larger 2TB card priced at $399.99. These expandable storage cards slot into the rear of both the Xbox Series X / S to match the internal SSD speed and provide extra storage for games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WT5BJ6"&gt;The first storage expansion card launched alongside the next-gen Xbox consoles, priced at $219.99 for 1TB of space. That pricing meant the $299 Xbox Series S jumped to nearly $520 if you wanted to add more storage and bring it up to 1.5TB overall. Now there are a variety of options for Xbox Series S owners who want to expand beyond the 512GB of space the console offers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNWz-LZEXsjGoKuG7ZNxqXp5a5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21904657/twarren_xboxseriesexpansion_VLS_3588_2_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The storage expansion cards slot into the rear of an Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0fFLIE"&gt;While the storage expansion cards certainly offer an ease of use on the Xbox, there’s still only a single manufacturer and they’re proprietary. Seagate’s 2TB model is priced lower than a top option like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722183/samsung-980-pro-ps5-ssd-heatsink-release-date-pricing"&gt;Samsung’s 980 Pro SSD for the PS5&lt;/a&gt; (priced at $449.99), but Sony’s more open approach allows PS5 owners to purchase cheaper Gen 4 SSDs where you can pick up a 2TB drive for less than $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qtS0o"&gt;Microsoft has previously committed to opening up its storage expansion cards to more manufacturers and different size options. For now it’s sticking with Seagate, but we hope to see more manufacturers and pricing competition that will benefit Xbox owners soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hieDPm"&gt;The new 512GB Xbox storage expansion card will be available in mid-November &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F678305132&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, with the 2TB option arriving in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get more space in your Google storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwObQCwXWoCoj32nK7XGHXBC3e4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830586/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="995CJ1"&gt;For many of us, Google storage is the modern-day hard drive. It’s the place where our most important thoughts, documents, and memories reside. But just like with a traditional hard drive, the space isn’t infinite, and running out of room can be a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4NMAK"&gt;By default, Google gives you 15GB of space to use for everything associated with your account. (If you have a paid Google Workspace — formerly G Suite — account, your limit’s likely higher.) That includes content connected to Gmail, Google Drive, and all Google photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;(except those saved before June 1st, 2021)&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, data adds up fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxF6Db"&gt;You can check your current storage status by visiting &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/settings/storage"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, and if push comes to shove, you can purchase more space there, too, for as little as &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/about"&gt;$2 a month&lt;/a&gt; for an extra 100GB. But shelling out more money might not be necessary. A quick round of old-fashioned housekeeping could be enough to clear away your virtual cobwebs and give yourself ample room to grow. Here’s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wffTjP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete Drive debris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U71Zuv"&gt;Google Drive is a common place for space-sucking files to build up and wear down your quota, but tidying things up doesn’t take long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FhULDM"&gt;Open &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/quota"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, which will show you a list of all of your Drive files sorted by size with the largest items at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8jiO21"&gt;Look through the heftiest offenders and delete anything you no longer need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EbNW2h"&gt;Click the gear-shaped icon in Drive’s upper-right corner, and select “Settings,” followed by “Manage Apps”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0JSjeI"&gt;For any apps that have a note about hidden data, click the gray “Options” box to the right, and select “Delete hidden app data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Drive hidden data" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiCKE3hpTX9bhDcrXlFW0ljAzKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969666/google_drive_storage_hidden_app_data.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For any apps that have a note about hidden data, click the gray “Options” box to the right, and select “Delete hidden app data.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f7323i"&gt;Apps associated with your Google Drive storage can sometimes have hidden data, but all it takes is a couple of clicks to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="VuPUfN"&gt;Open &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/trash"&gt;your Drive Trash folder&lt;/a&gt; and click on the “Empty trash” link at the top of the page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ckrevF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free up Photos storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6baCi7"&gt;Unless you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562908/google-future-pixel-phone-no-unlimited-photos-storage-confirmed"&gt;currently have a model 5 or earlier Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt; (in which case, you will, for now, keep the unlimited “Storage saver” option), as of June 1st, 2021, every photo and video backed up to Google Photos is going to count against your Google storage. If you’ve been saving photos at their original sizes, you can free up tons of space by converting them to Google’s “Storage saver” option (which used to be called “High quality”). This compresses images down to 16MP and videos to 1080p (a change that’s &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Photos-High-quality-vs-Original-Whats-the-difference-and-should-you-care_id93938"&gt;unlikely to be noticeable&lt;/a&gt; for most people and purposes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="II1hIJ"&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/settings"&gt;Photos settings page&lt;/a&gt;, and select “Storage saver”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aqoG3F"&gt;If you switch to “Storage saver,” your previous photos won’t automatically be compressed. To do that, on the Photos setting page look for the “Recover storage” button, which will compress many (but not all) of your existing videos and photos. (Check out the list on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt; to see which images will be affected.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can compress many of your saved photos and videos to save space." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-JTr5sMpJqEQcIZEQc_L6xGI68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944457/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_9.12.58_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can compress many of your saved photos and videos to save space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0pmJ3q"&gt;Another handy resource on this same page is the “Manage storage” button. Tap that, and it will take you to a page which will tell you approximately how much more time you have before you fill up your storage space, and offer to find (and delete) blurry photos, screenshots, and other possibly unwanted images that are taking up space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google has a page that helps you get rid of unnecessary images that are taking up space." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JoInGWU2zEHTHFsUGWH3tQPSlNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944463/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_9.19.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google has a page that helps you get rid of unnecessary images that are taking up space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kIkJIH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say goodbye to Gmail junk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mjcRaE"&gt;Emails don’t take up a ton of space, but you know what does? Attachments. Odds are, you’ve got plenty of old attachments sitting in your Gmail account that you don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUTMcd"&gt;Here’s how to address that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EaQUsC"&gt;Go to the Gmail website and type “has:attachment larger:10M” into the search box at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="78cbK0"&gt;Identify any messages with disposable attachments and delete them. (There’s no great way to get rid of an attachment without also deleting the associated email, unfortunately, but you can always forward a message back to yourself and manually remove the attachment before axing the original.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="viHWJR"&gt;Open your &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#spam"&gt;Spam folder&lt;/a&gt;, and click the link to “Delete all spam messages now” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="v7aCfx"&gt;Open your &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#trash"&gt;Trash folder&lt;/a&gt;, and select “Empty Trash now” to send everything away for good &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QN1Yay"&gt;Feeling lighter is liberating, isn’t it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxCbPk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 19th, 2021, 10:37AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on March 19th, 2019. The information on Google Photos has been updated and it’s noted that G Suite is now Google Workspace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncharted’s first movie trailer is full of very familiar action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jlwERDUHrf0t1clrJmXXWafC9cg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025589/Uncharted_Thumbnail_16x9Textless.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WD2JKE"&gt;After over a decade of development (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21043622/uncharted-movie-director-travis-knight-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg"&gt;seven directors&lt;/a&gt;), it seems that Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie is finally, really, truly going to actually come out — &lt;a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/world_premiere_of_uncharted_movie_trailer"&gt;and it has the trailer to prove it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGImXX"&gt;Starring Tom Holland as an incongruously young version of fortune hunter / adventurer / general human punching bag Nathan Drake, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; is set long before the popular video game series, winding the clock back before Drake was a seasoned Indiana Jones knockoff to the start of his career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meHMUB"&gt;It is kind of hard to shake how young Holland looks here compared to his more grizzled video game counterpart, along with what appears to be an identical American accent to his Spider-Man voice in the Marvel films. But Sony will have plenty of time to convince fans to get on board in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hE8bN4SzT9bKWGn0ZqTJWCEruKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944479/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_9.13.47_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSiV5g"&gt;Despite ostensibly being a prequel, fans of the games will note that a lot of the action in the film looks &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;familiar: the big plane set piece looks ripped right out of &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception&lt;/em&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDXI4w"&gt;The film also features other notable &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; characters, even if they’ve been rendered virtually unidentifiable here: Mark Wahlberg is playing a mustache-less Sully (Nathan’s father figure / partner), while Sophia Taylor Ali is a young Chloe Frazer, who apparently knows Sully in this version of the franchise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOOpT2"&gt;To put some perspective on how long the film has been in development, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/mark-wahlberg-will-be-nathan-drake-deniro-could-be-dra-5698269"&gt;Wahlberg was originally set to play Drake himself&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, over a decade ago, when work started on the adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jziGq4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only major Naughty Dog video game adaptation in the works; the studio is also working with HBO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457686/merle-dandridge-hbo-the-last-of-us-adapatation-live-action"&gt;on a TV show version of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, set to star Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB5ivu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; is set to finally hit theaters on February 18th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting ray tracing thanks to a Microsoft and AMD partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sgk-I62U8N_7-wWQd6qyvxf9nHE=/112x0:1318x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025569/Picture2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNsRH6"&gt;Microsoft has selected AMD as its exclusive PC partner for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. While this means plenty of marketing opportunities, it’s also fostered a closer engineering partnership with AMD that Microsoft says will improve frame rates in the campaign mode and eventually bring ray tracing to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tveypM"&gt;“We’re looking forward to working closely with AMD to bring raytracing to&lt;em&gt; Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/halo-infinite-the-great-journey-on-pc/"&gt;says Noah Benesch&lt;/a&gt;, a product marketing manager at Xbox. “Raytracing is one our top development priorities post-launch and look forward to sharing more soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1qBHv"&gt;It’s not clear if this rules out Microsoft using Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, but Microsoft does note that AMD is “exceptionally open to us bringing new rendering features across all hardware as well as performance improvements for all our players.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKKIXsscRj5nhHzNbx60igXws74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944462/Picture2.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD has created a Halo-themed RX 6900 XT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwu7L8"&gt;Beyond ray tracing, which will presumably be available across both Xbox Series X / S and PC, Microsoft says the AMD partnership has resulted in driver updates that “deliver massive improvements in frame time performance throughout areas of the game’s campaign mode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfosT4"&gt;The engineering work has also improved &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; on processors with high core and thread counts, which is an area where AMD has excelled with its latest Ryzen processors. Microsoft and AMD have also created a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Radeon RX 6900 XT. It’s a limited-edition card that won’t be sold, but Microsoft and AMD will be hold giveaways for the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKYLPs"&gt;Outside of the AMD and Microsoft partnership, the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; team has also been working with Discord and Razer Chroma RGB to ensure the game integrates well. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; will support in-game Discord server invites and even Razer Chroma RGB support with unique lighting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiMOyo"&gt;TCL, the company best known for its affordable Roku-equipped 4K TVs, has a new budget-oriented $399.99 5G tablet — the Tab Pro 5G. The device is available to order via Verizon’s online “Buy More, Save More” promo, which takes $100 off if purchased with a qualifying Android device on a Verizon plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRryU4"&gt;Similar to its newer TVs that now offer Google TV in the US, TCL’s Tab Pro 5G continues the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt; with a standard set of Google apps... alongside the expected mass of Verizon bloatware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It comes in one color" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kUiJ3EgRl-CdUj2jVRdn3L2G4TE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944409/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_8.41.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet is meant to be held in widescreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1PM6zb"&gt;Tablets with 5G have not entered this price point yet. Verizon also sells the $669.99 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE 5G and the $649 iPad Mini with 5G. However, if you want an iPad with high-speed mmWave connections like this TCL slate has, your cheapest option is an 11-inch iPad Pro that starts at about $1,000. The technology’s limited range means it’s more useful if the signal is available within a block or two of where you live and play, but at this price point there just aren’t any other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZqbMS"&gt;The TCL Tab Pro 5G’s 10.36-inch (1200 x 2000 resolution) “NXTVISION” LCD screen is accompanied by stereo speakers that together provide an “impressive cinematic experience,” according to the company. Dark mode, reader mode, and a software HDR effect are included. Parents can screen-nanny their kids longer with a fast-charging 8,000mAh battery that TCL says can endure up to 17 hours of mixed use and can work as a power bank to charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXQCU"&gt;Optics include a front 8MP camera with face unlock and a rear 13MP shooter with LED flash and 1080p video capability. There’s no headphone jack, but the company includes a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box along with an 18W charger. On the edges of the tablet, you’ll also find a USB-C connector, fingerprint sensor, volume buttons, dual microphones, and what seems to be a five-pin accessory connector.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mysterious five-pin connector is visible on the bottom of the landscape-oriented Tab Pro 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1rho03"&gt;The TCL Tab Pro 5G is equipped with Verizon mmWave and 802.11ac Wi-Fi (no Wi-Fi 6 here), 64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 1TB via microSD), and it’s running Android 11. With an eight-core Snapdragon 480 5G SoC and 4GB of RAM, it can probably handle light to medium gaming and a bit of productivity on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Messenger now lets an entire group share an AR experience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cjz2IoH6ovzF2-PfhCK__qIxcKE=/0x1:3239x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025349/Group_Effects_Header_Image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEUsQK"&gt;Facebook Messenger is adding “group effects” that allow everyone on a video call to participate in the same augmented reality experience at the same time. The effects are available now across Messenger video calls as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233468/facebook-messenger-rooms-live-instagram-live-igtv-video-chat"&gt;Messenger Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, the service’s Zoom-like videoconferencing feature, and are coming soon to Instagram, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWt5iI"&gt;There are over 70 group effects available at launch, including a game where players compete to build a virtual burger, and another where a virtual orange cat photobombs the call. It’s a shift from the service’s existing augmented reality features, which tend to only apply to one participant at a time. Facebook says developers will be able to build more group effects using its Spark AR API from the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs2qi0"&gt;Alongside the shared group AR experiences, Facebook also announced a collection of smaller features coming to its chat services this month. New “word effects” will allow iOS Messenger users (and eventually Android users) to trigger an animation in a chat when a specific phrase is used. For example, &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/25/lets-celebrate-10-years-of-messenger/"&gt;in August the company showed&lt;/a&gt; how messaging the phrase “Happy Birthday!” could be set to trigger the party popper emoji to fly up the screen. There are also new “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578633/facebook-messenger-sound-emoji-soundmojis"&gt;Soundmojis&lt;/a&gt;” to tie in with &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, as well as chat themes and Halloween artwork for Messenger chats and Instagram DMs. &lt;/p&gt;
