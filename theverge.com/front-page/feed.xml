    <title>iFixit expands repair partnerships by building official service tools for Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eGwEskETRkaxeoplR0FDHDvekVg=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269314/service_tool_2048x2048.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’s new “debonding” tool that helps cut the adhesive holding Surface screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVMCbt"&gt;iFixit &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F56078%2Fifixit-works-with-microsoft-to-manufacture-service-tools-for-repair-techs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22833120%2Fifixit-microsoft-surface-repair-tools-partner-professional-service" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has begun selling official Microsoft Surface repair tools — but only for certain service partners. Known for its extensive online tech parts store, the company now manufactures and distributes the Microsoft-designed tools in a partnership that will give businesses and schools more options to fix the popular Surface devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HebtpL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iFixit says Microsoft reached out to the company saying it wanted to improve repairability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tF7oDF"&gt;This new partnership is not the first OEM deal for iFixit. Motorola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/23/18013320/ifixit-motorola-official-parts-repair-kits"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/11/20690277/motorola-ifixit-partnership-replacement-phone-parts-europe"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; iFixit as an official source for its OEM smartphone parts, and so has HTC with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405537/htc-vive-ifixit-repair-parts-guide-direct-to-consumer-sale"&gt;Vive&lt;/a&gt; — but for the Microsoft Surface, the tools are available only to members of iFixit Pro (the company’s free wholesale program available to businesses) and Microsoft’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fjlvft"&gt;Available tools include a battery cover to protect batteries from getting punctured during repair (preventing fires), a “debonding” cradle to help cut the adhesive holding the screen glass (and prevent accidental over-intrusion), and a weighted frame vise to properly re-adhere a replaced screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The tool looks like a black picture frame but hollow in the center, leaving only a black bezel." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9f72qtRNcllxj-ukISWLDC5uhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086702/IXHPjfxVJJNPSXMK.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A weighted frame that helps to bond the adhesive when reinstalling the Surface screen. Works like a vise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1CFrPV"&gt;Microsoft Surface tablets and laptops have not been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3983854/ifixit-surface-pro-tablet-teardown"&gt;particularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/17/15824670/microsoft-surface-teardown-ifixit-impossible-repair"&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to fix in the past. “We’ve given their machines 1’s on our repair scorecard,” said iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Wiens mentioned how vocal iFixit had been criticizing Microsoft’s designs and irreparability over the years but said Microsoft reached out to the company stating it wanted to improve. This comes at a time when companies like Apple are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;working to improve&lt;/a&gt; repairability options for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHHOWJ"&gt;“We were skeptical,” Weins told us, “but Microsoft has consistently stuck with it, and they have systematically worked to improve the repairability of their products.” He also says Microsoft shared best practices for repairing its Surface products and that the knowledge will be shared in the repair guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeqdQW"&gt;These tools are, unfortunately, only for newer Surface devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/8/21252634/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-screen-crack-free-repair"&gt;cracking-prone&lt;/a&gt; Surface Laptop 3 (2019) and newer, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/7/20953137/surface-pro-x-teardown-ifixit-ipad-repair-screen-disassemble-hardware"&gt;easier-to-fix&lt;/a&gt; Surface Pro X (2019), the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review"&gt;business / education-exclusive&lt;/a&gt; Surface Pro 7 plus (2021), and Surface Pro 8 (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ykZij"&gt;When asked if iFixit plans to sell the tools to all customers, Wiens responded, “Our hope is to make these available to the general public, but we don’t have timing that we can announce right now. We’re still trying to gauge demand from the professional community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7CUk7"&gt;Wiens tells us that the tools are ready to ship worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peter Molyneux’s NFT game will make being nice cost real money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Peter Molyneux In-Store Performance at Virgin Megastore in London - October 7, 2005" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLwSlzAwTOhHDQJIQOmHCW1lYsw=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269280/112379621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ferdaus Shamim/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A business simulator that’s also a business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="b09sd5"&gt;Game developer Peter Molyneux is known for his groundbreaking “god games” &lt;em&gt;Populous&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Black And Whit&lt;/em&gt;e&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;for the classic roleplaying series &lt;em&gt;Fable&lt;/em&gt;, and for a chaotic crowdfunding campaign that involved asking people to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/26/4367834/curiosity-ends-revealing-peter-molyneux-goddess"&gt;tap a mysterious cube&lt;/a&gt; that might make them a god inside a game that has now been &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-28-is-godus-dead"&gt;in Steam Early Access&lt;/a&gt; for eight years. As of this weekend, you can add one more item to the list: NFT game developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6BtMp"&gt;On Saturday in Las Vegas, Molyneux announced a partnership with cryptocurrency gaming platform Gala Games. Gala and Molyneux’s development company 22Cans will work together to launch &lt;em&gt;Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;a management game that Molyneux first announced in 2019. As &lt;a href="https://blog.gala.games/legacy-land-sale-starts-tomorrow-c54761629c0f"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legacy&lt;/em&gt; will incorporate a new digital currency called LegacyCoin (on the Ethereum blockchain) and players will join the game by buying a non-fungible token, or NFT, called “Land.” Once they join, they can form a business in the game, build a town around that business, and compete or cooperate with other players to increase their LegacyCoin funds. It’s supposed to sit in the same broad “play to earn” genre as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;better-known &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but with the kinds of moral choices and management systems for which Molyneux is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh4BCD"&gt;Molyneux is probably the most accomplished developer to make a serious foray into crypto gaming, although publishers like Ubisoft have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;launched NFT sales&lt;/a&gt; for cosmetic items. But over the past decade, he also became known for making huge undelivered promises around the crowdfunded title &lt;em&gt;Godus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-01-22-it-was-tempting-to-retire"&gt;retreating briefly from the public eye&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 after a &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rock Paper Shotgun&lt;/em&gt; interviewer&lt;/a&gt; suggested he was a “pathological liar.” (Among other things, &lt;em&gt;Godus&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to share its profits with a player who was declared its god — &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-11-the-god-who-peter-molyneux-forgot"&gt;something that didn’t happen&lt;/a&gt;.) He’s either an odd fit or the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; fit for NFT gaming, a sector that’s often described as overhyped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxMi5Q"&gt;Just before Gala announced it would be launching &lt;em&gt;Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, I spoke with Molyneux via Zoom about his new effort. I was curious how a developer known for fine-tuned fantasy worlds would apply his ethos to a game that people would be playing for real money or possibly even &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/axie-infinity/"&gt;as a full-time real-world job&lt;/a&gt;. I was curious what the game was about, since the description seemed to promise a complicated fusion of business sim and city management. And above all, I was curious what a blockchain actually added to the experience. The answers were intriguing — if not always illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Legacy art showing people running around a cartoon town square holding items like teddy bears." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Bfz79sJ3_itQoB6q2_cgrH4dvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085590/legacyhero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;22 Cans&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dsi8EK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfkFMu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I watched a trailer, and I wanted to make sure I understood the parts of the game. It seems like there’s a city building component, then there’s also a section where you have a business and you’re trying to make things for that. And then you’re also selling those things in auctions or contests against the other players.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnOTiH"&gt;You’ve just done the whole job for me! When I first thought of &lt;em&gt;Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, wouldn’t it be cool to do a game which made everyone feel creative? But the problem with creativity, I always find, is that I am totally incompetent when it comes to drawing or painting or singing or writing music or gardening or almost anything. And so what we would need is a game that really helps you be creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5b9Jn"&gt;What I came up with is, wouldn’t it be a great idea to have a game which is about starting your own little business? And there was this tradition that still exists in today’s world, which is that manufacturing businesses used to be centered around little towns and those towns used to grow into cities because of the manufacturing. And that’s where the city building comes in, because you are responsible for designing all the products that you and your business is going to sell. You’re responsible for getting all the commodities that those design products need, and you’re responsible for winning the design competitions that go on between you and the other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ef7RHP"&gt;But really, I don’t think that’s enough. You know, it’s not enough just to have a city builder. It’s not enough just to have this amazing design table where you can design any product, where you can design any building that your city builder is going to use. What we also need is a fantastic narrative. So through all of this is this amazing narrative story which adapts itself to what you’re doing in your town, what’s going on in the bigger ecosystem, and you know, the tragedies or successes that your business has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An item creation table in Legacy." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TsFHw2UKMCeHOsQO1-rYDFI-nfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086824/Legacy_Design_Carousel_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An item creation table in Legacy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3dY2Sx"&gt;We’ve got these things we’re calling events where you win something called LegacyCoin. We’ve got these events that pit you against those other players, and we’ve got the most advanced simulation that I have ever been involved with. There are moral choices and the narrative storyline really picks at those moral choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYsJLp"&gt;So you know, what sort of business are you going to run? Are you going to be a really nice boss, or you’re going to worry about the environment? You’re going to worry about your workers? That’s fine, do that, absolutely. But are you going to make as much money as the evil bastard that’s going to push the workers and, you know, perhaps not give them free time, that doesn’t really care about pollution? What we’ve got is a game that encompasses all of that within blockchain gaming. And for me, you know, I think it’s those sort of big steps forward that blockchain gaming needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5WMHO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does blockchain do and LegacyCoin do for the kind of narrative and moral choices you’re talking about and the feeling of creativity you want to capture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1zBtN"&gt;Well, the first thing to mention is that because you are competing against other players and those other players are using blockchain that they are using everything that blockchain gives us, it enables us to compare those players in a really interesting way. And you know, are you going to be someone that gives back, or are you going to be someone who just cashes out? And that’s what’s so fascinating about having a living world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WNPRe"&gt;And I think as a living world, it’s totally unique. You know, every building you design, every product you design, every worker that you’ve got. So we’ve got this unbelievable simulation, this incredible narrative we weave through the game. We’ve got moral choices in there and competing against each other, all within this totally new world, which is, of course, exactly what blockchain is all about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EawM1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You could do all the things you were describing with just a normal game database. Why is blockchain specifically important? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEADdy"&gt;The first thing is that — you have to earn the right — but you can create your own blockchain items from within Legacy. Let’s say you create a factory where your product is going to be made, and that building can look as crazy as you want it to look. All depending on the blocks that you unlock. But the cool thing is, that building, those workers, your whole world is gaining unique experience depending on how your game is progressing. And that is embedded into the item. So you could make this factory, you could use it for 100 hours or however long it is, and then you could put that building up on the blockchain itself. I mean, that’s pretty incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxjuAq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the idea of a real-money economy supposed to be playing into the game’s theme? It seems like it adds an interesting dimension to the moral choices — like, it will actually cost you money in the real world if you want to be a moral boss. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBVYa"&gt;This is a real incentive, of course — if you’re playing the game, if you’re doing well, if you’re earning points, that can be converted into real-world money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NuZSH"&gt;The blockchain gaming experiences that I’ve had so far — and I won’t name any names — just seem to forget about the game entirely, and it just becomes far more of a mechanic about making money and less about your game. I think we have to have, you know, signature unique titles just like any revolution that has happened within the games industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu2HWS"&gt;And it is, yes, it is absolutely about ownership, but it’s also about consequences — because when you’re playing the game, we are measuring those moral consequences within the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh8wax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say that people start playing your game and they start making enough money that it becomes like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, where it’s people’s full-time job. But there is some kind of decision you have to make with gameplay that’s going to make something drastically less profitable and change the economy. How do you balance the fact that that’s going to affect people’s real livelihoods?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enTNzR"&gt;Well, that’s exactly what we’re working on at the moment — when you’ve got a complex simulation, what you’ve got to do is, you’ve got to get the balance and refinements absolutely right. We’ve got all the features in the game, and what we now are doing is balancing the simulation so that it doesn’t ever tilt to one side in extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REzZPc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if, say, players find some kind of workaround that lets them make a bunch of money and are essentially scamming the game — and they need that money because this is their job now, but it makes the whole game less fun. What do you do in that circumstance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMucpd"&gt;Careful monitoring and, you know, self-balancing mechanics. We’re going to have to see how the world reacts to little changes. It would be amazing for me — I mean, I’ve worked on so many designs and I’ve worked on so many games, but to think that someone could be playing my game and earning money, what an incredible honor that would be to have. But we’re going to have to be super careful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VRmDw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much is your design based on a sort of understanding of real-life economics and how much of it is, for lack of a better word, creative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSJqV7"&gt;Well, you know, I learned this lesson when I did a game called &lt;em&gt;Theme Park&lt;/em&gt; and another game called &lt;em&gt;Theme Hospital&lt;/em&gt;, and the temptation is to be inspired by what happens in the real world. The economics of running a theme park. The economics of running a hospital. That is the temptation. But the whole core of those games is: if the logic of what you’re doing gets in the way of the game, I think you should resist the temptation. I mean, I wouldn’t like to ever go to a hospital that was inspired by &lt;em&gt;Theme Hospital&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and I definitely wouldn’t want to go to a theme park that was designed by &lt;em&gt;Theme Park.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roub9e"&gt;I want people to imagine, not the reality of running a business, but more the reality of &lt;em&gt;playing&lt;/em&gt; a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0XRAw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it fair to describe &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; as a game where you are building and running a company town?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRFfvZ"&gt;Yeah, that is. If you want to see a perfect example of this, if you look at Bournville, there’s this company called Bournville Chocolate. And when they founded the company, they founded it and paid people in Bournville Chocolate tokens. They built all the houses for the people to live in, they built all the schools. So everybody in Bournville was employed by the chocolate factory, and that is the real inspiration. If you look at something like China, I know a lot of the Chinese companies, the owners of the companies design the houses for the workers to live in. So even in today’s modern world, there are examples of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hlnwib"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Especially in America, “company town” has a pretty negative connotation. It’s seen as being synonymous with companies controlling the lives of their workers and making it hard for them to leave. Is that intentional?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWFegH"&gt;Well, I’m not saying that my monthly trips to Redmond up at [former employer] Microsoft were any inspiration. You’re never quite sure where inspiration comes from, but it certainly felt a little bit like that. You know, everyone, you went to the gym and everyone in the gym, you know, worked for Microsoft. And you know, I’m English, so going into the changing room and then being naked in front of any human being is just a deep, terrifying thing. And that was even more terrifying when you realize there’s [former Microsoft CEO] Steve Ballmer over in the corner and there’s someone else over there and you know, you realize that, “Oh my god, I’m part of this family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNmifV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s one thing if you’re Steve Ballmer, but I think that it’s just a term that if I mention it, a lot of people are going to think: this game is really dystopian. And I’m wondering if that’s a fair read of it or if that’s not the way that you mean for it to be interpreted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI5pHv"&gt;I want to give you the absolute ability to make the perfect town, to make sure all the workers are completely happy, that they’ve got, you know, cafes and cinemas and schools. All of this happens within the game, you know, people get married and they have kids and they need to go to school. I want you to have the power to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4TPYb"&gt;But I want you to also realize that with that power, there are consequences to that. Your business may not be as successful as my business. Because it’s a simulation, I can approach this in a completely different way. I can say, “No, I don’t want to build cafes and cinemas. I want to build another factory.” There’s a full pollution simulation in the game, so if you build lots of factories close together, you’ll notice all the trees around it will start withdrawing, that more workers will have really bad coughs. There’s a whole range and that’s what’s so fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfJeza"&gt;I’ve been obsessed with that for almost two decades now — I have been obsessed with giving people the freedom to make that choice. What I’ve been working on for years now is to tempt you to be good or to tempt you to be bad, but not to force you down any of those dystopian ways. What’s going to be fascinating about this, especially because it’s in the blockchain world, is to see actually what people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCayoc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the promises of blockchain gaming is that people’s items can “live” outside the game. Say someone creates a thing and mints it as an NFT, and for whatever reason you decide to shut down the game and it’s not playable anymore. Is there something that happens so it’s still available in some fashion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqMzcn"&gt;That’s a really good question. I have no idea of the answer, to be completely frank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xu3hHF"&gt;But what I am immensely proud of is if you make something in your world and you then trade it to someone else, that item that you make, whether it be a building, whether it be a worker, will carry with it all the benefits that you imbued in it. And I think that’s what’s really exciting for me is that the things you acquire on the blockchain will make your world a better place. If you take a worker and you put that worker to work in a mine, over time, that worker will become an expert miner. And then if you take the worker and put him to work in the pub as a landlord, he’ll become an expert landlord / miner. And that sort of experience flows through the whole of &lt;em&gt;Legacy&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an all-connected system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHsEcI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m still just kind of trying to figure out what blockchain does for this beyond the real-money economy, because all the stuff you’re describing, you could just make a central database and you could just fill that database with the items. Like, there’s no reason it seems like it needs to use a decentralized cryptocurrency ledger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSZYVl"&gt;Except for the fact that what you don’t want to happen is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/diablo-3-says-goodbye-and-good-riddance-to-the-auction-house/"&gt;what happened in &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because they had exactly that. They had a central database. People could craft things and put them up and what ended up happening was you had this tidal wave of complete... well, I’m not going to say dross, but I just did. Which totally unbalanced what should have been at its heart a really delightful system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4u9ym"&gt;The great thing about blockchain is it gives it a certain sense of — I’m going to use honesty, because I think it’s the best thing. To put something up is going to cost you LegacyCoin, and that LegacyCoin means that this marketplace won’t be spammed. So that’s the first thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIasoJ"&gt;The second thing is just to go back to remember what I first said, that &lt;em&gt;Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is a game that makes you feel creative. Now, the fact that you feel creative is great. You know, I love spaghetti Bolognese or a beautiful picture. But if no one ever sees it, if no one ever buys it, then you know, you might as well not have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fScW4a"&gt;The fact that your design has gone on to be seen and appreciated by other people that make money is, I think, the big thing. That’s in addition to the fact that this is blockchain gaming and people can make money while playing a business simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APVHdj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Godus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Godus Wars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ever coming out of Steam Early Access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UHqBWW"&gt;I’d love to bring them out of Early Access, I’d love for there to be a happy ending to the &lt;em&gt;Godus&lt;/em&gt; story. I mean, we have got a team that’s dedicated to &lt;em&gt;Godus&lt;/em&gt; working at 22Cans. They’re super excited. Before Christmas, we are announcing our first new set of features for &lt;em&gt;Godus&lt;/em&gt; in almost two years and that should be coming out before Christmas. I just hope that I’m not going to be killed to death for saying that, but that is coming out. So I’d love, you know — in a perfect world, yes, I’d love that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The metaverse is already here — and it’s full of Pokemon, Niantic CEO John Hanke explains</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You’ll Pokémon GO into the metaverse with AR not VR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jSl3On"&gt;John Hanke is the CEO of Niantic, a company that makes the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; mobile game in partnership with Nintendo and the Pokémon Company, but John actually started it as a skunkworks project when he was a Google Maps executive and spun it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdWuAb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and its predecessor &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt; are now the largest and most successful augmented reality games in the industry, which means John has long been at the forefront of what we’ve all started calling the metaverse: digital worlds that interact with the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApC9H2"&gt;Lots of companies are chasing metaverse hype. Mark Zuckerberg just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;renamed all of Facebook “Meta”&lt;/a&gt; to underline his shift in focus, and we just had Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; to talk about it — but John’s been at it for a while, and I wanted to talk about the reality instead of the hype: is the technology for all this ready? What are the innovations that need to happen to enable some of these dreams? And how do you solve the problem of people walking around in headsets, experiencing wildly different realities from one another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCjPpM"&gt;We also coin the phrase “marketplace of realities.” It’s a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrMCgL"&gt;Okay. John Hanke, CEO of Niantic. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v32znB"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9034719992" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FnId68"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Q46K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMXqoq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Hanke is the founder and CEO of Niantic, the maker of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAwy43"&gt;Thanks, Nilay. Great to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR5IE6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am excited to talk to you. The metaverse has a lot of big ideas to unpack, but I want to start at the very beginning. What is Niantic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkyZPj"&gt;Niantic is a company that is building some really fun, innovative entertainment products: &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761166/pokemon-go-ar-games-future-pikmin-harry-potter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, and lots of others in development. Niantic is also building a platform so other people can build games and other products that connect us as people to the real world and with other people in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaaAxu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel nuts describing this to people because &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is such a massive phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but to be specific: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is a game you play on your phone. You walk around the real world, trying to catch pokémon that appear on your phone in various places. It’s obviously a massive multiplayer game. Is that a fair description of all of your products, or is that more specific to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6c858P"&gt;I think it’s fair. Our overall goal is to turn the world into a game board — to turn the world itself into a more magical, fun place. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is a great example of that. It allows all of us who love this series to live out that fantasy of pokémon existing out in the world: finding and catching them and trading them and battling with them, and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4oM0l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a little bit of an interesting backstory here. You started at Google, and Niantic was part of Google, correct? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is the first game Niantic created that is still running. It is very popular, so it spun off into a company. Could you describe that process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTTmrV"&gt;I worked on [Google] Maps for a long time. I co-founded a company called Keyhole, which was acquired by Google. Keyhole was the foundation for Google Earth and parts of Google Maps. I ran that group and worked on maps for a long time at Google. Then we started Niantic Labs as a little skunkworks. Three of us peeled off and said, “We’ve got this amazing map of the world, all this great infrastructure like mobile phones and wearables that seem really interesting; what kinds of apps can we build for that future?” We started experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXTL58"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; was the first game. It is still ongoing, and has been an underground, massive success. I don’t know how else to describe it. Once you see &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, you start noticing it everywhere — but it’s not &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It’s not some mainstream huge success in that way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGqeeE"&gt;I would call it our underground cult success. Our first product out of the gate at Niantic Labs was actually Field Trip, which was not a game. Field Trip was about learning about the world — cool places to go, history, artwork that you might see in public spaces. It was really designed to be the app that would be the precursor to what you might have on smart glasses someday: you’re walking around and you want your device to inform you about the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhJ0Oo"&gt;Our second product was &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt; is that thing that turns the world into a game board. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, two teams battle against one another to control the world — à la Risk, but with a sci-fi, J.J. Abrams bent — around portals, which are public artwork and historic places, and other landmarks in the world. You interact with them and take them over, and then the other team does the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdYmIM"&gt;It’s a global MMO, so it’s very collaborative, with teams formed around the world, across boundaries of countries and ethnicity and language. To this day, Russians, Koreans, Israelis, Japanese, Americans, and Argentinians are still battling to control the world in &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;. I do it daily on my morning walk as well, so I’m part of that struggle for control of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iasHa8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love it. Niantic is adding some new messaging and communication features to both &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; next year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1zgHXw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ABg0FO"&gt;Social has always been a core part of our products. For us, that means helping people get together and spend time together with friends and family in real life. We are working on a couple things. One is a feature that’s coming in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; that gives you a way to share a postcard of cool places you’ve visited in the real world with your friends in the game. The other thing that we’re doing is a little bigger and broader in nature: a cross-game social identity. &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt; is the first place that feature will show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeyqLL"&gt;It is a way for you to communicate and plan activities with other people. Planning meetups is a core part of what people do in &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt; and in other games like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go.&lt;/em&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Ingress&lt;/em&gt;, people plan raids and farm portals together. It gives people a way to easily find friends who are in their area — meet them, talk with them, talk about the game, share things about the game. Importantly, people plan opportunities to play together in real life. That core social identity and set of social services is something that we see as a fundamental part of our games and our platform in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDbAoc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to the company as a whole: could you describe the process of spinning out of Google and becoming your own standalone company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udc8LS"&gt;The process was six months of pain and torture with piles of documents and goodwill on all sides. It was incredibly painful to separate intellectual property and people out of a company like that. We had started Niantic with the idea that we might spin out at some point, because we knew that we were doing something a little orthogonal to what Google was interested in and doing at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy4CIl"&gt;We said, “Hey, we want to try this.” Larry [Page] was supportive. We had constructed some paperwork around the group that said, “Here’s some parameters so that if you want to spin it out in the future, it can be a possibility.” That cracked the door and we had to push on it for a while to make that happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1ioYS"&gt;At the end of the day, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo financed us, along with a venture capitalist and some angel investors. That allowed us to stand up Niantic as an independent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bl8nz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long ago was that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVPLQB"&gt;That was in October of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUbvdh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people is Niantic now? How much have you expanded?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZPdWl"&gt;We are around 800 people today. We were around 30 when we peeled off of Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQaBUR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. How is that structured? How does the company work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vOfpb"&gt;We have game studios, we have several internal game teams, and producers that work with external game teams. That’s the gaming side of the business, Niantic Studios. Then we have the platform. We recently officially launched it externally as the Niantic Lightship platform. That takes all the tech and data we created to power the experiences that we launched, and makes those available to third-party devs. I’m super excited about that. We’ve worked with third-party devs for the past several years, but this makes it a website you can go to, enter your information, and get right into it — access those APIs, tutorials, how-tos, and all that. It’s a big step forward for the company. That’s the other half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGIKam"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundationally, what’s the split? How many people work on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; versus the Lightship platform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HaMG1"&gt;If you look across all of the games portion and all of the platform portion, which includes all the research work that we are doing on AR and mapping, it’s about 50/50 in terms of our product and engineering resources. Of course, we also have operations, marketing, other functions, and an HR department that supports everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no4rFf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m assuming the revenue is mostly &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; stuff to grow with the platform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfhAZ3"&gt;Yeah, we are growing it with our portfolio of games. We have about a dozen products in development. We just launched &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, and we’ve got several others that I’m very excited about. Those will be coming out in the next year or two. We’ve been working on them for the past two or three years. That’s the short-term revenue growth story. With the platform, we’re really focused on engaging developers and just growing the number of people working on that platform first. I think revenue’s not really the primary focus of that part of the business at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0O7h5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the last of what I think of as the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; questions: how do you make decisions? Obviously, you were a startup founder. Then you were inside a big company. Then you had a renegade project inside a big company. Then you were a startup founder again. What’s your decision-making framework?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rj56P9"&gt;That’s a great question. People who work with me tell me I’m pretty methodical. I do like to get all the data on the table. I like to hear from multiple people. Obviously, the idea is to delegate and have other people make important decisions as well, but if a decision is coming to me, I like to hear from a variety of people. We actually have an internal value around inclusivity. We try to create a safe space for everybody to come forward, speak their mind, and really argue forcefully for what they want to do. At the end of the day, we have a “disagree but commit” culture. That means that if we don’t get to consensus — I think we ought to get to consensus maybe 70 percent of the time — but if we don’t get there, then I will make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3F5YO"&gt;At that point, we expect everybody, even if you disagreed strongly or put forward other points of view, to really align behind that decision. I think it’s important for everyone to commit and execute an idea as if it were their own. The decision-making process itself is about encouraging people to come forward with data to support their points of view so that we can make the best call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TODPo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put this into practice for me: you had a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759677/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shutting-down-january-2022-niantic-ar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; game that you decided to sunset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How did that decision work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPl0JJ"&gt;Yeah, we are sunsetting it. We’re going out in style with a ton of great content. All the stars of the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; world are making an appearance. We’re trying to really bring that game [&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;] to a fun close in January. It is something that we looked at. The game would probably be considered a success by other companies in the space, but it didn’t have the growth opportunity that we felt like it needed if it was going to consume the mental time and space of some of our best people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNJsOT"&gt;We deliberated about that for a while, and ultimately, I talked to the board about it. We looked at all the numbers internally about what we thought the game could do and what changes we thought we could make — but at the end of the day, we felt that our people would be best invested in other projects. We came to the conclusion to sunset it. Then we got to work thinking about a way that would be best for all the players that were enjoying the game and had committed time and energy into it. We tried to sunset it in a fresh, fun way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDvE4k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the best opposite argument you heard, to keep it going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1NXcw"&gt;That the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;players are passionate, committed fans to the game that don’t want it to end and will keep playing; that the game could be a success within certain parameters. We could have continued to grow it from where it was if we invested in it and built on those core fans. It was tempting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7lEin"&gt;Actually, we went down that road for a while. It was a unique project in that it was a joint effort with Warner Bros.’ gaming studio, so we were building the game together with them. That, ultimately, was another factor in deciding to not go down that road. You’ve been around the tech industry for a long time, you know that every time two companies are trying to do something in a cooperative way, that process is just harder. I mean, I’m sure you see that even inside your own organization: when trying to make decisions — and when more and more people join the table — it becomes harder and harder to move quickly. We just didn’t think we’re going to be able to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tux3Au"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you made that decision, did you send the news in an email? Was it a Slack message? How did you deliver the words, “We’re going to sunset the game and start making a plan”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpFtK3"&gt;I’m trying to remember. It was something that we talked about and deliberated in various meetings of various forms over a long period of time. When we ultimately decided to sunset the game, I remember having a conversation with the team to express my gratitude for everything that they had done and to explain the context for the decision. I think that was after we were in COVID, so the news was delivered over a Zoom call, which was as in-person as we could manage at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cs6wM1"&gt;Obviously, people are our greatest resource. They pour their heart and soul into these projects, so my biggest concern and focus was making sure that those people really felt appreciated for the great work that they had done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M3JrF"&gt;Games are like movies or books or television shows. Not all of them are going to have the success that you would want them to have. We have to put our best creative effort out there, and some are not going to make it. That’s true of some of the things that we’ll launch in the future as well; it’s just part of the nature of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGo3YJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the next big set of decisions the entire industry is facing: do you think you’re in the metaverse business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXzxJe"&gt;I’m not responsible for introducing the word “metaverse” into this whole public conversation, okay? I just want to say that I didn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2O4Ye"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One person is very responsible for this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipaKih"&gt;Don’t blame me for it! Once that conversation got started, I did feel the need to speak up and talk about what the metaverse is or can be. I felt like a lot of people were maybe a little bit overly influenced by what we all endured during COVID, which is to say: spending a lot of time at home, a lot of time on Zoom, kids going to school remotely, watching kids spend a ton of time on Roblox, binging on Netflix, getting delivery food, the whole thing. A lot of these products saw a big lift from COVID. I mean, let’s be honest, people were spending a ton more discretionary time and energy in these worlds. I think that fed a level of frenzy around thinking that the “metaverse” is the future and that we’re all going to live in these 3D worlds. I just don’t think that’s how it’s going to play out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1YynMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not responsible for introducing the word ‘metaverse’ into this whole public conversation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nLvwil"&gt;Over the past 50 years, the trajectory of technology has been towards mobility and ubiquity — what Xerox PARC pioneer Mark Weiser would call a ubiquitous computing vision. We took a detour during COVID; that is my personal opinion. I mean, I’m a huge sci-fi fan too, so I read Neal Stephenson and William Gibson and the whole array of writers back when we founded Keyhole. I’m deep into the latest Neal Stephenson novel right now, actually. Those of us who’ve read the books to the end know how they end. That’s a horrible vision for the future: the world has just completely gone the wrong way and people have to escape to these virtual realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTtkbv"&gt;I don’t think it’s how things are going to play out. I don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it to be how things will play out. I’m a techno-optimist in the sense that I think AR — a real-world version of that metaverse, if you will, that’s about getting people outside and active and learning about their city, state, town — can help bring us back together. It can help us get reconnected with our communities and the places that we live. Those are all the things we need to do so that we can fix some of the problems we’re facing here in the US, and probably in other countries around the world, to build the future that we will feel good about passing on to our kids and to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bU2RGA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I always think it’s funny that Neal Stephenson and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; come up a lot.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Spoiler alert: the resolution of that book and that movie is that they turn the system off. That’s literally the last thing they do — hit the button to turn it off.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I’m always puzzled when those books come up as a positive example of what people want to build. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMltAG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niantic builds a lot of augmented reality products. When you point your phone at the real world, the digital world is layered over it. AR right now is very much a phone product. The other vision of this is a totally virtual reality, and I think the best expression of that is Mark Zuckerberg, the person who’s introduced the word metaverse the most so far. He changed the name of the [Facebook] company to Meta. He’s got the Quest 2, which is maybe the preeminent VR headset. It’s a great product, about being in a totally virtual world that you can extend to other kinds of games like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minecraft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or Roblox or whatever. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6gDcz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see a split there? Or do you see AR and VR converging in some way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCHDOp"&gt;AR and VR have a lot of shared features. Our Lightship platform is about infrastructure that can allow millions of people to share what you’re interacting with in the game world, which is overlaid on the physical world. You can message back and forth to one another. I can get updates whenever you change something in the world. Similar technologies are needed for the VR version of the metaverse. Likewise, some of the tech for AR glasses and VR glasses, there’s a lot of overlap there in terms of a head-worn device, and you have to miniaturize a bunch of stuff. You have to do 3D. You have to have sensors that track where your head’s pointed and various things like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bmUap"&gt;There’s a lot of overlap, but the end state for them is very different. VR is a sedentary process where you’re going to slip into this virtual world. You are going to be cut off physically from people who are in your vicinity. You’re at home on the couch with your significant other or other family members. Are you going to really want to be in VR? Are you going to have the four of you lined up there all in your headsets? Maybe you have an avatar representation of other people, but it’s fundamentally a poor substitute for the real human-to-human interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uWbd3s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“AR is about getting out of your way as much as possible with the technology”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOkQEw"&gt;AR is about getting out of your way as much as possible with the technology. If it’s a wearable device like a watch, something in your ear, or eyeglasses, AR is about giving you information. Maybe it will help you have fun playing a game, going on a secret treasure hunt out in the world, and finding pokémon. Maybe it just tells you how to get there: painting arrows on the ground, showing you where the subway is. Maybe it shows you the menu of the restaurant you’re standing in front of before you walk through the door. Maybe you tap on a virtual UI to make a reservation or check into the airport. It’s about being helpful, but allowing you to primarily exist in the world as a full-blown, involved human being: using all your senses, enjoying being out in that environment, and probably hanging out with other people in the real world. But AR is just trying to make that experience better, not cutting you off and replacing it. That’s the big distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aamnOB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push on that a little bit. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We had Chris Milk on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; earlier this year; he runs Within, a company that makes Supernatural, a VR exercise app. That VR app was just bought by Meta for, reportedly, $500 million. You put it on your head, and you can’t see the world around you. That killer workout app is completely about your body. It’s not isolating you from your body or taking you out of your body in that way. A lot of Meta’s vision for VR is avatar-based. The avatars don’t have legs, which is very confusing, but you’re going to be in space with other avatars. That’s going to give you a sense of what Zuckerberg calls embodiment. You’re going to feel physically present with other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78ebFc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your form is not present with other people, but you feel that way because of the technology. Isn’t that related to what you’re talking about with AR? It’s another world you can exist in where you are spending time with friends and catching a set of three-dimensional cues. In the case of Supernatural, you are hyper-aware of your body. There’s a tension there between what AR promises — which is to put you in reality, but better — and where VR seems to be going, which is a little less coherent, but still about being present.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc1wpc"&gt;I will definitely step up to the mic and take the invitation to argue the other side of that one. I think the product you’re talking about, Supernatural, is a really cool product. I have a lot of respect for the creators. However, when I say isolation, I’m not talking about you and your body. I’m talking about isolating you from other people and from the physical world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKHSYE"&gt;Look, Peloton’s useful. Immersing yourself in a home theater experience is fun. As cool as that is, and as much as there’s a place for those experiences, it does cut you off. There’s just no question about it, from your normal way of interacting with the world and with other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHapOG"&gt;I would argue strongly that a visual representation of an avatar — even if it’s a really photorealistic avatar — doesn’t do that. We’ve seen some examples, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751177/facebook-meta-codec-avatar-real-time-environment-rendering-neural-interface"&gt;Codec Avatars&lt;/a&gt; and others, where the experience gets super realistic. Your body senses the world and other people in a very broadband way: eyes and ears. When human beings are together over time, your heartbeats and the frequency of your brainwaves will actually synchronize. In terms of how we relate to other people, there’s a ton of stuff going on in the body that’s evolutionary in its origins, that allows us to learn how to trust people, to bond with people, to build relationships with people. Obviously, those adaptations were integral to our survival in the past. We are evolved and built for interacting with people in the real world. It is a deep, deep thing that is throughout our physiology and how our minds and bodies work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hesvs"&gt;To think that we can just put two OLED displays in front of our eyes and believe that we’re replicating all that comes from those real interactions just isn’t true. That experience is sipping through a soda straw in terms of the bandwidth with which you’re going to perceive the environment and other people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZvpxp"&gt;There’s a place for it. You and I are talking remotely at the moment. It’s a miracle that people around the world can connect, but it shouldn’t replace our desire to be together with people physically. I think it’s just core to our human nature: it’s fundamental to our being happy. It actually triggers endorphins when you have face-to-face interactions with other human beings. I really think it’s about finding peace of mind and being happy and being true to what we’re evolved to need in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyO76i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re obviously making a much bigger bet on AR for all of those reasons. AR seems like it has a much longer technology pathway than VR. You can just buy a headset with a couple OLED displays and some speakers in it. The Quest 2 is more or less a midrange Android phone that you strap to your face. From a component perspective, the thing is complete. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Up86rQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AR is really far away from that. The first problem is getting glasses on your face, and no one has come anywhere close to that in a mass-market way. Do you see that problem getting solved soon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGyaaM"&gt;VR’s definitely an easier technology to solve for obvious reasons. Putting the video screens in front of your face is an easier technological feat to pull off than pass-through glasses where you see the world and the technology adds information to that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnau0c"&gt;Having said that, I had our latest prototypes of the glasses we’re developing on my face this morning. We had a whole bunch of people in the office who were working on that project testing out various things with our version of these glasses yesterday. That’s a reference design that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997493/niantic-qualcomm-xr2-ar-glasses"&gt;we’re building together with Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;. Tons of progress is being made, even between what the public version of Magic Leap or a HoloLens 2 was a couple years ago to what we’re developing now. We’ve made huge strides in miniaturization, the optics, and the brightness, and we’re getting closer to a not-horribly-geeky-looking device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWL6Bn"&gt;Extrapolating forward by a year or two: we are going to get there. There’s no question that it’s harder, but there are massive investments being made across the industry. Some of those enclosed ecosystems — like large tech companies who are doing it in a very closed way over in China with the ODMs of the world — they’re investing in this technology and trying to get good at making these products. Lots of people working on optics are happy to provide those to multiple different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeqyDD"&gt;It’s not open-source, but there’s an open-ish ecosystem of supply chain people working on this technology and investing tons of money. We are going to get there. I think we’re a handful of years away. We’ll see devices that are, maybe, good for gaming before we see an all-day kind of device. AR Ray-Bans that just look exactly like ordinary glasses are even further afield, but we think it’ll be fun to play in the early days when these products aren’t quite the all-day device, but are going to be good for games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RuU8sK"&gt;Looking at the evolution of technology: we had &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt; before we had the IBM PC. We had the Game Boy before we had the iPhone. As the tech gets invented, games are often the way that we’re first introduced to it. Then the tech matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qwW8z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right. It happens over time. VR was a bunch of games first, but now you can be in a conference room in the VR headset.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnAY7H"&gt;You could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJgpDX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that the end state of this? I don’t want that. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0V55Bo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about that tech. The relationship between hardware capabilities and software applications is very deep. To put it in a very simple framework: you would not try to develop the Uber app if the LCD display on the phone didn’t work and you couldn’t hold it in your hand. If you had a CRT iPhone, Uber just wouldn’t exist. Right now, some of the display technology for AR stuff is shipping. It’s mostly waveguides — which refract light into your eyes in different ways — but the technology is not there yet. Are you investing in that piece of the puzzle or are you just assuming that progress is going to happen so you’re focused on the software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc6QRo"&gt;The purpose of our reference design work is to pull together the best of what’s out there. In some cases, we’ve made a couple of small investments in optics companies. One of those is public: a company called DigiLens. DigiLens has a different technique for creating waveguides, which is to apply a substrate on top of glass or plastic, then shape it using a process that’s a little bit like photolithography. That’s an easier way to make a waveguide than to actually etch the glass itself. It’s a lot cheaper, which is very interesting to us from that point of view so that we can get to the right price point. We have an investment in another company that is innovating in a different type of waveguide that’s brighter — a wider field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLtUbQ"&gt;We’re nudging that technology forward. I think the biggest way that we’re nudging that forward is by pulling this stuff together into a reference design: the compute, the optics, and the software, and trying to push the envelope for a device that can be used outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3T9eHc"&gt;A lot of what other people have been focused on have been indoor devices, like a Magic Leap or a HoloLens. A Silicon Valley tech company is maybe going to do an AR product this year, and maybe it is going to be more of an indoor-oriented device than an outdoor-oriented device. Based on the interest that I explained earlier — about connecting people with the world and moving and being active with other people in the world — we’re really trying to push the envelope to pull the tech together for outdoor devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pIZBC"&gt;We see progress in all aspects of the components: the computing that’s needed to drive this, like wirelessly connected compute devices that are separate from the glasses. You pull a lot of the mass and heat off of the unit that has to go on your head and put it into a phone or puck. That’s going to be an interesting step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCzAYs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are big challenges, right? You need a battery that lasts all day, but battery technology is stagnant. You need a processing capability to take in all the camera input and then display something. Then you need the display technology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhpq1F"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEyebg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The processing side of AR is maybe the farthest along — collecting input and producing output. Mobile devices have become reasonably good at processing, but the display and the battery seem like huge roadblocks to the glasses, to me. Every one of these products has bet on one type of display technology. The first time you showed me a smartphone, I could have told you, “Man, you should invest in some LCD companies because these screens are going to be really important to all of us one day.” I don’t know that right now I would make that same bet on the types of display technologies I’m seeing in AR products.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqft8E"&gt;I think there’s good stuff out there. Again, there’s technology in our prototype, reference-design device that’s pretty good. It’s very bright. It’s legible outside and has a good field of view. It’s really a question of just evolving that. I don’t think that radical new invention is required to get to the optics that we need for good AR. It’s just a few more turns of the crank in terms of the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erAsq5"&gt;Looking back through the history of technology, like Alan Kay’s vision of the Dynabook in the early 1970s — it took a while for that to become reality in the form of the laptops that we all carry around now. It’s a similar story with personal computing. It’s a similar story with the early bad dial-up internet compared to the broadband world that we live in now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61S6QB"&gt;I listened to your great interview around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22820571/springboard-handspring-documentary-youtube"&gt;the recently produced Handspring documentary&lt;/a&gt;. That’s another good example of lots of iteration around smartphones before we really got to the final formula that took off with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYnz0a"&gt;It’s common in the history of technology for iteration: versions of things that don’t quite get there for consumers before the final thing clicks. That’s where we are with AR. Looking back at the last 50 years of tech, I see a similar pattern, and I think that we are going to get to the finish line. I’m very excited about the opportunities for computing to be less intrusive. Carrying a phone around in your pocket takes one of your hands away. We’re juggling the coffee, the bags, the kids, and the stroller. We’ve all learned how to do that now, but it’s not really ideal. I don’t think that that represents the endpoint for the evolution of personal technology, but rather a way station along the road. It’s pretty good, but I think we can do better. That’s what this is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOxKuF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the way, that documentary — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is my colleague Dieter Bohn’s project. I assure you, he is very tired of thinking about ’90s cell phones at this point, but it’s great. You should go watch it. It’s on YouTube now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC5zKq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the hardware side, but let’s talk about the software side of things. I feel like you mentioned the other big Silicon Valley tech company might be doing something. Apple has spent years doing AR demos on stages. It’s always a person holding an iPad and showing you a train going around a table. Then they literally ship AR sensors in their phones now. The only successful mass-market AR application I can think of is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. That game has endured. It has revenue associated with it and it is still compelling to players. Everything else is a tech demo. It’s looking at a couch in your living room and that’s the end of that experience. What is the next set of compelling AR applications with the hardware we have today? Is it still just games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEiLYf"&gt;I think that you have to ask, “What is AR?” Then you have to break that acronym apart: augmented reality. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is an augmented reality game because pokémon are made to exist out in the world. That game is about mapping the world: understanding habitats where pokémon could conceivably exist and then creating infrastructure so that alternate reality is shared amongst everybody who is playing the game. If I see that Snorlax in the park, you’ll see the Snorlax in the park, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBRDr6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is about adding creatures and information to the physical world. It’s not just the screen technology that sometimes I think we associate with the phrase AR, that hologram on the screen. Apple and other tech companies have done a good job of that very specific aspect of AR, but the concept is broader than that. It’s about this notion of spatial computing. It’s about knowing where you are in the world; turning the physical world into something that has information or interfaces attached to it. That is where the real power of AR comes into play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3cnRo"&gt;AR, by the way, doesn’t necessarily have to involve the screen. You can hear about the AR world through your earphones or get information about it on your watch. Ultimately, AR is about the place that you are, the object that you’re looking at, the thing that you want to interact with. That is very much augmented reality in the sense that I’m talking about it. Humans are visual creatures, so I do think that visual aspects of AR are important. A visual form of AR will probably be the one that we ultimately prefer because people just like to look at stuff generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irvlVp"&gt;I would contrast that way of thinking about what AR is from the on-stage demos that show off the latest in-phone camera and AR visual computing. It’s just a fraction. You asked what the next big successful apps that we’re going to see will be. Our big bet is on products that make the world come alive, make the world become useful, make the world become connected — connecting the atoms and the bits, connecting the physical world with the digital information that can help you know more about it or help you interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OaoIR"&gt;The big linchpin for that is not the visual part of AR in the sense of just overlaying a hologram into the scene, but knowing where you are in the world and where your gaze is directed, precisely. We can get an approximate location from GPS. You can get a really bad orientation from the compass that you have on your phone device. The calculations are off by 10 meters in a GPS — and if you’re in an urban situation, possibly even more — so the compass gets really confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7KCgf"&gt;If you’ve ever had that experience of coming out of a subway station and trying to orient yourself, you walk a block before you realize you’re going in the wrong direction. There’s an AR map that lets a camera know exactly what it’s looking at in the world so that you can make the pokémon hide behind the park bench, or you can provide the information about the public artwork or the menu or the airport check-in, like I described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIvhDG"&gt;We are building that map in a collaborative way with people who play our games and contribute map data. That collaboration is a key enabler. When you ask, “What Niantic is doing to make this AR future happen? How does your contribution relate to what Apple, Microsoft, or Google is doing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyv1Rl"&gt;We’re really focused on that UGC [user-generated content], collaboratively built map because it’s critical to unlocking millions of really amazing AR apps that are, in some cases, an evolution of stuff that we do on our phone today. It’s more directly connected to the thing that we want to learn about or interact with. Completely new apps that we haven’t even imagined yet will be built from that starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYVzZG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niantic has millions of people playing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; who are creating map data for you. Is that collaboratively-generated map the heart of the platform that developers will be using?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdvVqi"&gt;It’s a key part of it. We talk about the platform, Lightship, as being mapping. There’s a real-time mapping aspect to that in terms of understanding the topology of your environment, like where the park bench, the tree, the table, and the chairs are, so that you can put a hologram into that environment and have it scurry around on the ground, but not walk through objects or walk through people. That’s something the platform provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JY3X1a"&gt; You see a lot of early AR and bad AR where the holograms are oblivious to all the real stuff that exists in the world, so that’s a problem that we solve. Another piece of what the platform does is understanding. That’s computer vision that knows what those pixels are, so it knows that that is water or pavement or grass or sky or any number of other categories. Again, you can situate your AR objects into that environment in a way that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyYMaD"&gt;If you want to place something that really belongs in the water or on grass or in the sky, or should be walking along the sidewalk, then that semantic information is joined with the map information so that you can start to create these really advanced and intelligent forms of AR. The third thing that we’re helping developers solve is sharing that multiplayer environment, because a lot of AR apps aren’t like that. You look through the device, you see what’s there, but nobody else sees it unless you share your phone with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAMPYK"&gt;What we provide is the client server data infrastructure and the computer vision infrastructure so that we can put that hologram into the room, and multiple people can walk up to it and all see it and interact with it. We can all see it change. If I push or pull on a virtual object, like a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-style puzzle, then we would all be able to manipulate it together and see the same thing. That’s what’s in Lightship today. The mapping part is something we’re working on that we’ll launch to our Lightship developers next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKf2hw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are moving up my stack of questions to the technology stack of the product itself. Will the battery last all day? What will the display be like? Are the processors fast enough to detect the water and spit something out semantically while not draining the battery too fast? That’s the hardware layer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv3J4P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then the software platform needs to have a great map that is generated either by users and games or an army of robot cars, whatever it is that other companies are going to do. Then you get to the last big problem: you’ve built the tools to augment reality, but who is going to augment reality? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; does not have an inbuilt misinformation problem, I’m assuming — there’s not a lot of deep divisiveness about Snorlax — but you have rules on that platform, right? You don’t let players play in cemeteries. You set all kinds of boundaries on what players in that game are able to do and not able to do because games have rules. When you’re looking at the United States Capitol building, how do you make sure the information displayed by an AR app is appropriate? Is that something you’re thinking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcmput"&gt;Yes. I think about related challenges as well. We’re building the tools in the platform today to let people augment the world. Users are beginning to do that. Other companies are building platforms to also allow people to augment the world. These platforms will become the basis for the next generation of computing devices that we all use all day long, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd2YPN"&gt;There’s a fork in the road here: whether we propagate the patterns that exist today with our devices and the companies that operate the services that we rely on — that log us in, that serve us ads, and track many things that we do in ways that, frankly, I find a little unnerving. As we move from phones to wearable tech, the issue gets even more serious because you’ve got devices on your body that can measure your heartbeat, that can measure whether your pupils are dilated or not, that know actually what you’re looking at and can tie that information together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Smn9HQ"&gt;Think about that: you’re out in the world, you see something, and you react to it. You see a person, you react to it. You see an ad, a product, you physiologically respond. You don’t click on anything, you don’t type anything in, but yet you’ve given something away. I think we have to think really seriously about what the rules are going to be around ownership of data and privacy, and what we want that world to be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfIUQO"&gt;We are really making a pitch to developers to say, “We can be part of building a world that we want to live in, or we let stuff happen based on what’s happened over the past 10 to 15 years.” I think people are interested in putting their time and energy towards something that’s going to address some of the flaws in the way that things have evolved — not necessarily because companies are trying to do bad things, but it’s just gotten to that point where there are some problems. I think we have to acknowledge that and think about a different way to do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mxSB2"&gt;You asked about something that’s a little bit different than that. What can exist in the world, and who decides what can exist in the world? I actually have an opinion about that. Maybe it’s controversial, maybe it’s not. I do think that there’s a great benefit for people to be able to share things. I’ve said that if I’m the only person that can see something, then you might think I’m a lunatic. The way society works today is that we have consensus reality. We all agree that this is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xmRiQ"&gt;Sharing is good, but I also believe that people should have personal choice. We don’t dictate what music you can listen to as you’re walking down the street. We don’t dictate what podcast you can listen to when you’re standing in front of the Capitol building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHkrDy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new law just passed: you can only listen to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdIWf8"&gt;I put AR in that domain. I think people should be able to theme the world however they choose to theme the world. If I want to see a world that looks a little bit more like Nintendo everywhere, and it’s bright and happy, and has Marios popping up from behind park benches, I think that should be my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="BkUrBc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think that somebody should assert some right to control what’s happening on my body and in my eyes or ears or whatever as I walk around. That would be a weird kind of censorship.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PSMB0S"&gt;I don’t think that somebody should assert some right to control what’s happening on my body and in my eyes or ears or whatever as I walk around. That would be a weird kind of censorship. Just think about it in terms of tapping on a virtual object and getting data about it. Today, I can look it up on Google. If I look at something in the real world and I want to learn about it, I should have access to all the choices that I have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqUClE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push. I think that Marios jumping out of cars is one example, but it’s an inherently safe example. That’s just someone next to you hallucinating via AR. Another example: you are standing next to me and we’re both looking at the Capitol building. What I see is the home of democracy, and maybe what you see is the building where the election was stolen from Donald Trump. That has drastic implications for society. Maybe that’s fine, but it does mean that there’s already a break between shared reality in this country and this world. Now people can fully inhabit different realities. It seems like we should think about that early, when we’re still worried about whether the batteries will last long enough, as opposed to later when we might have to impose a regime that looks like informational censorship or experiential censorship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFRuWb"&gt;Again, you could listen to a different podcast or different radio station while you’re at the Capitol. The problem you’re describing, which is this fragmentation of society, is real. The info bubble problem is real. We are suffering through some really bad consequences of this problem that we will have to mend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WzlnTP"&gt;But I don’t think the answer to that is controlling what AR hologram that you can see. I think it’s about drawing people out into the world where you can meet your neighbors. It’s about drawing users out into the world where you’re spending time with people from different walks of life. Come to a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; Fest: you’ll see stockbrokers and bike messengers and grandmas and suburban soccer moms hanging out together, doing a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; raid — all these people becoming friends, crossing barriers, breaking out of those info bubbles and seeing people just as people, not as categories or as labels that get attached in these hateful online forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cni0U1"&gt;What we need more of is more face-to-face human time. We need to spend time with other people to build those personal relationships. When you get people together in real life, generally speaking, you see a much more reasonable posture. It’s one of the reasons that local politics like school boards work. People come to it with different points of view, but you don’t have that sort of “us and them” mentality where each side is painting the other side as evil. You have people debating and arguing about things, but ultimately coming together in a civil way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aojSdA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right now, we are seeing school board politics in America get torn to shreds by misinformation on social media.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89jyjd"&gt;Exactly. These online virtual information bubbles get people all worked up and fired up about a certain point of view. Then they bring that into the physical context, but I think the real-world side of that is the way to diffuse it. More of that will actually reduce that level of vitriol where people are seeing each other as enemies, rather than people who maybe just have a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5jps4"&gt;We have to deal with it, 100 percent. I get your point, but I do think being in-person together is the way to spend less time immersed in a purely electronic mediated interface. I don’t know if you’ve seen this in your work, but I think Slack and online chat versus a physical meeting between people, even in a work context, things are much more likely to go off the rails when they’re electronically mediated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yiD2u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is incredibly easy to be a jerk on Slack. You should just make a phone call there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86aWXs"&gt;There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTooCJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s as much a reminder to me as anyone, honestly. Let me keep pushing on this a little bit, but not necessarily about misinformation, just about fragmentation. Do you see interoperability between the products you’re building and what Apple and Google and Meta are building? Do you see a way for those things to be interoperable or a way for them to connect to consensus reality of some kind? Or do you think we’re all just going to pick and choose in the marketplace of realities? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qljHev"&gt;There’s a couple of points that you’re making there. One is about interoperability. The early internet was all about distributed systems interoperating around open standards. It was a marvelous, wonderful thing, right? That’s what took us from the walled gardens of CompuServe and AOL out into a world where you could have many, many people creating and publishing — organizations like yours get created and whole businesses get built because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZRxYE"&gt;Over time, we have become much more centralized in how the internet operates, so some of the original ideals of the internet have fallen by the wayside as we’ve gone back to a more centralized model for all of the services that you get coming from a single company wrapped in a single, set infrastructure. That’s not really part of the open internet. The pendulum is due to swing back a bit in the other direction because of some of the problems that I alluded to earlier — for example, somebody knowing all of the information about you and everything that you do because it’s all flowing through one centralized system, versus users having more control over that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c6hKDA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The world is ready to go back to a more decentralized internet built around interoperability.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b7p1yn"&gt;The world is ready to go back to a more decentralized internet built around interoperability. When we talk about the real-world metaverse — which is the version of the metaverse I’d like to see created — I do see it as a system where products and services from multiple companies would interoperate. That theme comes through in the Web3 movement. That desire to pull back from centralized control by a few companies to a more open system that puts more control in the hands of the consumer does rely more on interoperability at its core. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcldMO"&gt;The second point that you raised was whether there will be a marketplace of choices. I think that, yes, we should be able to share those experiences. I should be able to poke you on the shoulder and say, “Hey, join me in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; world for a few minutes in the park. Let’s have that experience together.” Then you might drift back to the William Gibson world that’s adding elements to your reality. I think we should have the freedom to do that. I don’t think that we’re going to break humanity by allowing people to have some choice there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMtasf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think your applications are going to run on everyone else’s glasses? There are deep political and business considerations to running applications on phones today. Do you think those issues are going to get better or worse? Do you think more competition is coming for glasses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKOB8r"&gt;I think the devices that we use to access stuff are really there because we want the content. We want the service, we want the experience, we want the podcast, we want the app, and the best creators are going to create for the biggest possible audience. That is just the laws of economics there. You don’t want to pour all of your effort and precious time — and if it’s a company, its precious capital — into a project that has a limited audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUrl9D"&gt;In the world of phones, generally the most successful app experiences are compatible with both Android and iOS. I would argue if there were a third or fourth popular operating system out there that had traction, then content creators would also be trying to access those other platforms. We want the games and other apps that we build to run everywhere. We think consumers are going to want those popular applications on the devices that they use, so there may be some friction introduced by policies of people making devices that makes development harder. But I think ultimately what consumers want is the great apps and experiences, and that means, I think, we’ll be able ultimately to offer our experiences everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQIFH3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you started to have some of those conversations, or is that too far afield?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEFCXz"&gt;Sure. We have business development relationships with most of the major players in the space. We spend a lot of money with Google on infrastructure. We have very popular applications that make a lot of money in the app stores for Apple and for Google, so a lot of money that is generated by our apps flows to those companies today. We’ve done some public stuff with Microsoft around HoloLens. We’re friendly with other people who are playing in this space. I think a world that’s interoperable is the right one from a consumer point of view. It’s a business, and people have their own interests, but I do think there’s a megatrend that will pull us a bit more in that direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEmbbg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned Web3. I don’t know if you’d call it a killer application for cartography, but one of the most popular applications that I hear about for crypto products is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NFTs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — how NFTs will let you bring virtual goods from one digital experience to another. Are you bought in on this? Do you own any NFTs? Are you in the game? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b88zmv"&gt;I’ve only dabbled. I am not deep into NFT ownership as an investment. I think it’s really interesting. Obviously, one of the earliest precursors to what we think of as NFTs today were CryptoKitties, which is kind of a gaming collectible. I think the idea of taking your objects with you as you move between experiences is key to this interoperable future, real-world metaverse that we’ve talked about. I’m with it in spirit. In reality today, there are some challenges. Crypto is not very ecologically friendly when it’s a proof-of-work-based system, as Ethereum is today, though it’s supposedly evolving to proof-of-stake in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9P5MpC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will forever be evolving. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhfu87"&gt;Maybe you get around that. Consumers handling [cryptocurrency] wallets today is very non-mainstream in its current incarnation. I would predict that we will get to a version of that which is something that people will use to have portability of virtual digital objects, and that those will be economically traded. I believe in that future. I think we’re really early in it right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMQ8Qo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from all the issues with wallets, climate impact, energy use, and gas fees with regards to NFTs, what is the basic game design element here? I buy a sword in your game to move it to someone else’s game. They need to have coded the sword, along with its physics, into the game. Is that a surmountable challenge? Or are we all dreaming and reality is going to come crashing down on us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxljtW"&gt;It’s software. It’s all theoretically surmountable. I do think people tend to gloss over all the things that you just described. An NFT today is a few bytes, maybe, a pixelated image that’s encoded on the blockchain. Otherwise, it’s a pointer to a file somewhere. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the file, if it’s a JPEG image, gives you a 3D sword with attributes and capabilities that you can take from one game to the next. The way that that is programmed today is unique in every single game. Portability there requires either a lot of work to recreate assets for every single environment that they’re going to use it in, the behaviors for every single environment that they’re going to be used in, and animation systems for every single environment they’re going to be used in, and people agreeing on the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLnzgf"&gt;If you bring your super-rare sword to my game, what does it do in my game? Does it allow you to win the game with a single sword stroke? That would make my game not fun. Who decides what it actually does in different environments? Nobody has really solved that. Some things are easier than others. If it’s about bringing your avatar with you, or a pair of shoes for your avatar that you bought, or a virtual pet, or something like that — those things are easier, from a conceptual point of view, to bring around with you than things that are going to have a deep impact on gameplay. We would probably start with things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wnik6q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re going to start with clothes and dances. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BfYUW"&gt;I just think that’s easier, yeah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIvlPT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s my last big question, and then we’ve got to wrap this up. You have given me more time than you promised, which I thank you for. I have a killer app for AR in my head: I’m horrible at faces and names. If you sold me a pair of glasses that would just tell me the names of people I’ve met before, I would pay you almost any amount of money, and then I would immediately become the president of the United States. I would become the most powerful and charming human being to ever exist. I cannot envision how you would build that product, which does seem like the killer app that would bring us all together. How do you build that product without building a worldwide facial recognition database?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYhv2k"&gt;I think the product you described is a worldwide facial recognition database, so I don’t think that you can build that app without building that database first. I think the real question is: is that product going to get built? Is there some way to safeguard it so that it’s helpful and not abusive? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIGQCa"&gt;I don’t know. I’ve heard you describe that product before, and frankly, in the earliest days of when I first saw Google Glass, it felt like something that you would want. I’m also bad with people’s names, as people around me will attest to. It seems like it would be incredibly useful for a lot of people and a lot of social situations, but a very controversial company out there right now has already built a very widely applicable facial recognition database. I’m not sure what’s going to become of that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QkqQY"&gt;I do think there’s a high creepiness factor to having that sort of data in the ether. There’s potentially a high abuse factor. If you read cyberpunk — William Gibson, etc. — those writers imagine a future where such technologies are ubiquitous. People have face masks that they wear to confuse those systems. I don’t know if we’re headed for that or not. I’d like to believe there’s some way to engineer that in some distributed, safeguarded, opt-in way that would protect the privacy of people involved, but I don’t know. I don’t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxB7m7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for Niantic? What’s the next big project we should be looking for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFEeH2"&gt;The next big project is &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;. Check it out if you haven’t. It will make your daily walk a lot more fun. We have a ton of cool games coming, so if you keep your eyes on Niantic, you will see some really awesome stuff next year. From a tech point of view, we are incredibly excited about making this map work. The map is going to open up a lot of apps, not only for us, but for people in the developer community. For us, 2022 is going to be about what devs start doing with those maps, in terms of lighting the world up with real AR that’s anchored in the world, that makes real life more interesting, useful, and entertaining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZXjta"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s great. John, thank you so much for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It’s been an absolute pleasure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aBxiPa"&gt;I enjoyed it, Nilay. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quentin Tarantino is working on a podcast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Quentin Tarantino Speaks At Panel Discussion On “Pulp Fiction” NFTs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zNlGaY1RsvYk_iWHfbszjBm2XM=/0x0:6036x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269040/1350976804.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="etF6mU"&gt;Hello! It’s Tuesday. Have we all enjoyed &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That…&lt;/em&gt;, I hope? Did we all relish its podcasting angle, which has Carrie Bradshaw moving on from being a sex columnist and becoming a sex podcaster? Appropriately 2021! I hate to admit it, but I teared up at the first episode’s twist ending we all know by now. Carrie was finally going to be happy! Anyway, today’s a lighter one, other than my apparent emotional tie to a show I only watched as reruns. We’re talking about Quentin Tarantino’s new podcast, the great promo code ‘pocalypse (sorta), and moderation of live audio spaces. Off we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jUMRR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCOOP: Quentin Tarantino is recording a podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq7ARO"&gt;The headline says it all. Quentin Tarantino, famed director of &lt;em&gt;Django Unchained&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Kill Bill&lt;/em&gt; films, as well as seller (slash defendant) of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787216/miramax-pulp-fiction-quentin-tarantino-nft-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, is hosting his own podcast. From what I understand, per a source with knowledge, the show will involve Tarantino going through his media collection, like his CDs and DVDs, and discussing their significance. Earwolf, now part of SiriusXM, is producing the show and just started recording. It doesn’t yet have a title or release date. I’ve reached out to Earwolf for comment and will update if I hear back. But this continues our theme of stories around Hollywood coming to podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBERSc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: The podcasting industry’s consolidation and waning of promo codes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7492t"&gt;Earlier today, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22596711"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about a broader sentiment I’m hearing (and reporting) from direct response advertisers: as the podcasting space consolidates — often in blockbuster, multimillion-dollar deals — they’re increasingly finding themselves in less accommodating partnerships and being asked to pay way more for their usual ad spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xteXIl"&gt;These direct response advertisers are the folks whose goals focus on moving product, typically by relying on a promo code. Hosts might no longer be willing to read ads and instead rely on producers to do so; companies won’t swap out ad copy unless they spend more; and the prices are skyrocketing. A headline in itself is a source telling me Joe Rogan’s show used to cost tens of thousands of dollars to advertise on, which also allowed for an unlimited number of impressions because the ads were baked in. Now, Spotify requires a minimum spend of $1 million to even touch the show. The CPM costs more than $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTUk8y"&gt;Spotify commented, for what it’s worth, and said: “We believe the many innovations taking shape will benefit the entire marketplace, including creators and advertisers, and we’re confident that advertisers of all sizes will continue to find immense value in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjCj5S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QQOrY"&gt;You can — and should! — read the piece for the full context and reasoning behind this shift. (As you can imagine, lots of investment doesn’t come for free. You gotta make something in return.) But a couple ideas stayed in my notebook during this reporting that I want to discuss. They aren’t fully baked, like these ads (heh), and include more questions than answers, but regardless, I want to put them into the world. One thing I’m thinking through is how these higher prices, which broadly seem to be industry-wide, impact cross promotion. We all know a tried-and-true podcast marketing strategy is to swap, or pay for, podcast promotion on other shows. I wonder if these CPM prices will affect that market, whether it’s podcast networks having to pony up for higher CPMs and being unable to afford it, or fewer swaps happening because ad space is saved for paying customers. My hunch is yes and yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZPeGA"&gt;The second is the growing market of companies trying to address the podcasting middle, or shows with some following that maybe aren’t at the level or scale to interest the major tech companies. Spotify has tried to do this with Anchor sponsorships, aka Ambassador Ads, as they’re now called. That is apparently ongoing. Meanwhile, Gumball is trying to scale the host-read ad, and places like RedCircle are attempting to monetize smaller shows. This will probably become critical to advertisers trying to stay one step ahead of the big platforms in identifying shows that work for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZ9tpq"&gt;Overall, the story I wrote and the ideas I’m thinking through all have to do with ~scale~. I hate to hit you with a buzzword so early in the morning but alas. Investment comes when folks see an opportunity to make cash, and that cash-making opportunity only happens when you can seamlessly sell and distribute lots of ads at a time. So the little shows tie themselves to bigger networks, bigger networks tie themselves to even bigger sales teams, and bigger teams suck up all the major shows. Scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4xtlk"&gt;I’ll re-emphasize that we here at &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; care about tracking how the podcast industry is changing as more money and tech companies flood the space. That includes big brand advertisers coming in, too. We’re watching the ripple effects, one of which is rocking the direct response advertisers’ boat and seeing how they keep it afloat. We’ll keep on reporting these stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZShaB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter Spaces’ live audio chats have zero moderation, literally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GId9vJ"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; about the moderation mess that is Twitter Spaces. The headline says, “racists and Taliban supporters have flocked” to the live audio feature, which, yes, is bad. But the more damning discovery is that Twitter apparently has literally zero moderation in place for these live spaces. “These chats are neither policed nor moderated by Twitter, the company acknowledges, because it does not have human moderators or technology that can scan audio in real-time,” the reporters write. A spokeswoman says tech doesn’t exist to scan live audio, and if it does, it’s too new to work properly. She does add, however, that the team tries to detect “problematic keywords” in the titles of Spaces. ​​Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wKXXz"&gt;This stuck out to me because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon"&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt; — I’ve been linking to this piece a lot lately, jeez — I wrote about how tough it is to moderate any audio, not just live. I called it the “impossible problem of moderating shows.” Transcripts are unreliable because nuance is difficult to discern, and in some cases, human review will be necessary. Podcasts also face the tricky issue of RSS feeds. It’s hard to deplatform a URL, unless you refuse to host it. In relation to Twitter Spaces, however, we might have an even bigger issue. The platform’s algorithm could take over, propelling these terrible rooms into people’s feeds, which becomes a whole new type of bad that has yet to really hit podcasting. Scaled, problematic content. Of course, if podcasting apps decide to task software with making recommendations, the same fate could play out. I don’t have a solution or anything helpful to add here, but rather, use this as a foreshadowing of things to come. Live social audio only took off over the past year and a half, and already, we’re in problematic territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="pXXi1y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1qoHm9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call Your Girlfriend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is ending, part deux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9Imle"&gt;Our buddy Nick Quah, who also happens to be the podcast critic at &lt;em&gt;Vulture,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/12/call-your-girlfriend-podcast-interview-ending.html?utm_source=tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=s1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=vulture"&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Call Your Girlfriend&lt;/em&gt; team about their decision to end the show. Insider subscribers know the show is ending, as Aria pointed out in our Friday edition, and today we have more context. I’ll leave you with this choice quote from Aminatou Sow, who uses today’s buzzword: scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U95n5d"&gt;“So we own every part of our company, farm to table. There’s a reason for that. We could have sold if we wanted to. Those opportunities came. The reason we kept the company the way we did is because we have really strong values around how we do capitalism. Capitalism isn’t great. I don’t love it. In order to sleep at night, there are rules we like to play by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZpKwt"&gt;I’m really proud of the business we built. I know what it’s like to pay everybody a fair wage. I know what it’s like to say, ‘These ads are not great. We’re not going to run them.’ So it’s hard not to roll your eyes at people who tell you it can’t be done. That it’s inevitable there will be union busters. That any kind of accessibility captioning is so hard to do. We know how hard it is. That’s why we kept the company at the scale it was at.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda wants to use connected cars to identify hazardous road conditions </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Severe Weather On East Coast As Remnants Of Hurricane Ida Move Over Pennsylvania" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzgIerzO9gUtsW7Vy8glM3pNdxM=/0x165:4495x3162/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269018/1337745411.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uj07nb"&gt;Honda announced an experiment to use its cars to collect data about hazardous road conditions. Using GPS and cameras, the Japanese automaker is gathering real-time road information about poor lane markings or potholes, which it can then send to municipalities for future improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDkDJU"&gt;The pilot project, which is being run out of the Honda Research Institute, is the first to use connected vehicle technology to capture accurate data on road conditions, the company said. To start out, Honda is collaborating with one state, the Ohio Department of Transportation, and plans to start providing road condition data in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u6Rjt"&gt;“Maintaining good road conditions helps keep everyone sharing the road safe,” said Paritosh Kelkar, scientist at Honda Research Institute USA and project leader of the road condition monitoring system, in a statement. “Real-time, high-accuracy roadway data captured from connected vehicles has the potential to improve the process of identifying, reporting, and more quickly repairing hazardous road conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6go0ur"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maintaining good road conditions helps keep everyone sharing the road safe”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="59TVpP"&gt;Honda’s cars will visually classify lane lines to the left and right of the vehicle using four color codes. Green and yellow classifications, respectively, indicate ideal to good lane marking conditions, while gray means no lane lines and red means the lane markings need repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifbNeo"&gt;Honda will also collect longitude and latitude coordinates, along with relevant images and video clips, which it then anonymizes and streams to a “secure platform” for analysis. Road operators will have access to the platform to identify the location, type, and severity of the road condition and hazard information, and obtain a still image and video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDEoPo"&gt;In some ways, Honda’s pilot could be considered a more targeted version of connected vehicle technology that has been promised for many years but has failed to emerge. For years, the auto industry has promised vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology to increase road safety by allowing vehicles to communicate with one another, as well as smart infrastructure like traffic signals, to better avoid crashes or other mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksmg8O"&gt;Some experts say the wide deployment of the technology could help speed the adoption of self-driving cars, which could use vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to bolster their ability to “see” their environment and make better driving decisions. Automakers are trying to get the Federal Communications Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233085/v2x-vehicle-to-everything-fcc-safety-spectrum-airwaves-wifi"&gt;roll back its decision&lt;/a&gt; to take away the current airwaves dedicated to that technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyMuq0"&gt;But the auto industry was slow to develop V2X technology, and the rollout has been piecemeal. Mercedes installed V2V equipment in both the 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/10/10746250/mercedes-benz-e-class-announced-detroit-auto-show-2016"&gt;E-Class&lt;/a&gt; and 2018 S-Class. General Motors also introduced V2V in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14869110/cadillac-cts-sedan-v2v-communication-dsrc-gm"&gt;Cadillac CTS&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. Other automakers began looking closely at a newer technology called cellular V2X (C-V2X), using existing cell networks to send communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTN7dG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDjlFV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJB1su"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LastPass is going to become an independent company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HIpULz4Izv-8h5Jq0rbcESdWcw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268897/acastro_210217_1777_passwords_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LogMeIn is making LastPass an independent company.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eOfXkZ"&gt;LogMeIn plans to spin out password management tool LastPass as a standalone company, it announced Tuesday. With the change, LastPass is promising that customers will receive enhancements on an “accelerated timeline” next year. “With a team solely dedicated to its continued innovation and growth, [LastPass] will be able to deliver even more strongly for users,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdyvAY"&gt;LastPass, which LogMeIn purchased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/9/9486343/logmein-buys-lastpass-for-125-million"&gt;for $125 million in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, is a popular password management tool; it’s used by “more than 30 million users and 85,000 businesses worldwide,” according to LogMeIn, and “the significant majority” of its business is corporate customers. LogMeIn’s emphasis on LastPass’ corporate use in its press release could suggest the standalone company is going to focus more on that audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abDw3C"&gt;The change arrives almost a year after LastPass &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;added significant restrictions to its free tier&lt;/a&gt;. LastPass now limits free users to only viewing and managing passwords on mobile devices &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; your computer. To access your passwords on all your devices, you need to be on a paid plan. If you’re still on LastPass’ free plan and want to move to another password manager, we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;a guide you can follow right here&lt;/a&gt;. LogMeIn has also been criticized for tripling the price of LastPass Premium &lt;a href="https://www.bruceb.com/2019/06/lastpass-learns-the-wrong-lessons-about-price-increases-from-logmein/"&gt;between 2017 and 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; there are “no plans” to change LastPass’ pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAberS"&gt;The shift is taking place nearly two years after LogMeIn agreed to sell itself to &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/lastpass-parent-company-sold-to-private-equity-firms"&gt;two private equity firms for $4.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter’s plan to save the smart home </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH3xc4NgYaMz_QI9ezoQSF9g1nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268903/acastro_211117_4887_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Matter is a new standard that promises to fix smart home interoperability — but can it deliver?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t5qLmO"&gt;The smart home should be a natural evolution of our homes, bringing better appliances, better systems, better experiences. But to date, it’s been complicated, confusing, and expensive. Walled gardens have stifled innovation as developers focus on getting their devices to work with three or four or more different platforms rather than spending their time creating better products and new features. Consumers spend too much energy figuring out which product works with which and then troubleshooting those connections, before often giving up on the whole thing. This has led to a slower smart home adoption than many expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCtd7u"&gt;What the smart home needs, and has needed for a long time, is a universal connectivity standard — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028256/smart-home-standard-google-apple-amazon-alexa-siri-zigbee-choip"&gt;basic level of common plumbing in our homes&lt;/a&gt; for everything to flow through. Just as we chose VHS over Betamax in the ’80s (and Blu-ray over HD-DVD in the early 2000s) for a better home theater experience,  so we need to choose a smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wyEbHC"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4578799766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EsEraa"&gt;The problem is there aren’t two or three standards to choose from. There are many, and none of them work very well on their own. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth have all tried and failed to become the primary radio protocol of the smart home. But none have gained enough traction or offered enough flexibility to fit into all corners of the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2P9z"&gt;That’s where Matter comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-Z-nOK7Q7nT95Yzp7aVixVZfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079856/acastro_4887_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vtaYcE"&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home. Set up that new device with your favorite smart home app, and control it with your voice assistant of choice, no matter who made it. This may sound like some distant smart home nirvana, but this is the promise of Matter. The simple smart home could be just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow3RE"&gt;An open-sourced connectivity standard created by over 200 companies, Matter is a communication protocol that leverages existing technologies — Thread, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ethernet — to allow all of your devices to communicate with each other locally, without the need for a cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2Fle3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUilte"&gt;What makes Matter more than just another smart home standard is momentum; most of the industry is on board. Organized by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (or CSA, formerly the Zigbee Alliance), Matter is being developed by Amazon, Apple, Google / Nest, and Samsung, alongside many other smart home and smart home-adjacent companies, including Wyze, iRobot, Signify (Philips Hue), Ecobee, &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVbU8O"&gt;Driven by a shared need to fix the problems of the smart home, these companies are working together to figure out how to make this standard be the one that sticks. Can Matter finally bring an end to the confusion perfectly encapsulated by Randall Munroe’s classic xkcd “&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"&gt;Standards&lt;/a&gt;” comic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeplUXpmj1adDXyyVOg8H8OzwcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084306/standards.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comic by xkcd&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNB9Yx"&gt;“This is a Renaissance [for the smart home]” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. “Most of the industry, if not all the industry have agreed that [Matter] is going to be the way this will happen.” They are seemingly all on board with the fact that Matter is the solution to the smart home’s biggest problems — simplicity, interoperability, reliability, and security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhf5Ct"&gt;The final Matter specification, SDK, and certification program should be ready by mid-2022, and the goal is to have the first Matter-certified devices available by the end of 2022, says Richardson. That’s over a year later than promised when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Matter first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L8H9co"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What matters about Matter, the new&amp;amp;nbsp;smart home standard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22596168"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETdn7w"&gt;If you have already boned up on what Matter is and why it… matters, and you just want to know what devices you can buy and when, head over to this “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22596168"&gt;What matters about Matter&lt;/a&gt;” article, where we look at what the different smart home platforms have committed to supporting around Matter and which devices are Matter-ready. Otherwise, read on to learn about how Matter is going to fix the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="up26W0"&gt;What is Matter, and why is it different?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zL4HCM"&gt;Matter is a unified connectivity technology for the smart home. It is not a smart home platform like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon’s Alexa. Matter doesn’t automate or control your home; it simply provides the pipes and language for devices to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow3IDq"&gt;Its unique feature is it’s an IP-based technology, meaning it uses the same mechanisms to communicate as the internet. So, there is no dependency on bridges or hubs, and yes, you will (eventually) be able to get rid of all those white boxes hooked up to your modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGjgMI"&gt;To simplify adoption, Matter will start as an application layer on top of existing IP technologies, including ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth (for device provisioning). This means Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sr_XaQQMw4yPG4CCnnPWSA7QnDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084404/start_developing_with_matter_graphic.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Silicon Labs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Matter network map from Silicon Labs shows how devices will connect to each other, to the internet, and to other protocols using Wi-Fi, Thread, and Matter controllers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5QDBu"&gt;Once in your home, Matter devices can operate entirely locally, talking to each other over Thread and Wi-Fi and not going through the cloud. That means if your internet goes down, your smart home will still work. Devices will still need to communicate with the internet for out-of-home control and firmware and security upgrades, which will happen directly or through a Matter controller device (i.e., a smart speaker, smartphone, or bridge). Local control is a significant step in maintaining privacy in the smart home, a big concern for people when considering installing smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wACI89"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"},{"title":"Google commits to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"},{"title":"Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQBxti"&gt;Smart home company Eve built its entire business model on local control. “Our privacy platform is ‘what’s at home stays at home,’” Jerome Gackel, Eve Systems CEO, tells me. “With Matter, you do not need a cloud — you can have one, but it’s not a requirement.” Its commitment to avoiding cloud control is why Eve devices have been iPhone- and HomeKit-only thus far. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;But with Matter, Eve can move to the other platforms while remaining entirely local&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8145w"&gt;What is Thread, and why is it better?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xzuPtx"&gt;Thread is one of the key technologies of Matter. It promises to make the smart home more robust. Like Z-Wave and Zigbee, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol. “Networking is one of the biggest problems of the smart home; sensors and devices dropping offline,” says Tony Fadell, founder of Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RYWAK"&gt;Nest first developed Thread and the precursor to Matter, Weave, in 2014. Thread’s big selling points are speed and reliability. A motion sensor will turn your lights on in a millisecond compared to a second, and your network won’t go down because you accidentally unplugged the hub, as — with enough devices deployed — a Thread network can self-heal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DXX7rddXUr9CI8ZEM-AOaIqdQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079855/acastro_4887_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidoTm"&gt;Unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, Thread was specifically developed as a smart home protocol. Other protocols used in the smart home to date have been co-opted into that role, meaning they have practical and usability issues. Wi-Fi is too power-hungry for battery-powered devices. Bluetooth has range limitations. Zigbee and Z-Wave require dedicated hubs, which are cumbersome to set up and maintain and can be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="rgpygN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOt5EO"&gt;Thread began in Nest’s earliest days. “Every single Nest thermostat since the beginning has shipped with a Zigbee radio inside, a connection for a long-distance, low-power protocol,” says Fadell. The idea was to future-proof a device likely to stay in the home for 10 to 20 years. “We wanted it to be able to talk to the future smart home,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5W7LAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10917556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGPb0G"&gt;But Zigbee wasn’t progressing fast enough for the Nest team, so they worked with Silicon Labs to develop Thread, which, in technical terms, is a Zigbee hardware stack with a software layer on top. “We knew what needed to happen — we needed a home IP-based mesh network with low-power range,” says Fadell. “The key is it’s IP native.” Low-power radios in the smart home have needed a hub or bridge to talk to the internet, but that problem went away by making Thread IP native. “That is what is so powerful about it,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbCEvG"&gt;Eve was one of the first smart home companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;to adopt Thread&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;working toward&lt;/a&gt; running all of its relevant products on the protocol, having shifted over from Bluetooth. “Thread has really changed the reliability of our product, especially in terms of automation,” says Eve’s Gackel. “The difference between our Bluetooth product and Thread product experience has really increased customer satisfaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzG3vv"&gt;Thread devices can be battery-powered or wall-powered, and the latter can be a Thread border router, a bridge between a Wi-Fi and Thread network. But a border router isn’t a typical white plastic box type of bridge that plugs into your router. The tech will be built into any device with an always-on power source and can be placed anywhere in your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HhyyS"&gt;A smart plug, smart speaker, fridge, TV, thermostat, and Wi-Fi access point can all be Thread border routers. “As you add more border routers in the home, you get better range and reliability,” explains Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google and a member of the CSA board. Case in point, the aesthetically pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements light panels are also Thread border routers&lt;/a&gt;, with a smidge more pizazz than a white plastic box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPRjYl"&gt;A border router is like a mailman: it routes the different packets of information. Unlike a smart home hub, it doesn’t know what’s in those packets or control them. If a smart speaker wants to know the state of a lock, the border router can tell it without ever knowing the state itself. “From an end-to-end security perspective, that routing aspect provides a lot of benefits,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7H15wWa4XdQiKA-u_uMYDtxrcm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084334/Thread_home_network.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image illustrates how Thread border routers connect a thread network to the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2UoA3"&gt;While Z-Wave and Zigbee will continue to be part of the smart home — existing hubs can be upgraded to Thread or bridged to Matter — it seems possible these technologies will be phased out in the residential setting. “It would certainly seem, if everything is executed as promised, that it will make sense to move towards Matter products,” says Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance. “That’s a big ‘if,’ however, and there are other questions in terms of security still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH0cQK"&gt;Because Matter devices can speak straight to the internet, that potentially exposes them to hacking or malware, says Klein. &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time), and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Richardson of the CSA. IP control is central to the function of Matter, and Richardson argues that the approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NAK1hc"&gt;How will devices work in a Matter smart home?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEu7g"&gt;The Matter home will need a Wi-Fi access point and a Matter controller. This can be a smartphone or tablet, but it can also be a Thread border router that works with your preferred smart home ecosystem — such as an Amazon Echo speaker, an Apple HomePod Mini, a Google Nest Hub, or a Samsung SmartThings hub. While devices will work across platforms, automations and routines will not. “If you are using HomeKit, you will need a HomeKit hub,” explains Gackel. “A Google hub will not run HomeKit automations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18wsbx"&gt;A Matter home will be able to incorporate any smart home device that is Matter certified. (The Matter logo on a product will indicate that it’s compatible.) You will also be able to set up any Matter device with your controller app, similar to how Apple’s HomeKit works today. All this means that when you buy a new product — such as a lightbulb or door lock — if it has a Matter logo, you won’t need to worry about what it works with; it will just work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzZFQeRI68rbbFLbOOvkuQFJUvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079854/acastro_4887_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omRzdU"&gt;It will also be simpler to set up. Amazon’s Frustration-Free setup is the basis for Matter’s standard setup process, explains Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126. It’s designed to enable a “zero-touch” experience, where you take the device out of the box, plug it in, and it connects to your home automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYr8J"&gt;This doesn’t mean there won’t be manufacturer apps, just that you won’t have to use them for setup. Still, in some cases, you will need them to access device-specific features that aren’t available in Matter, and probably to update firmware, although this may happen through Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="07kogK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies are committing to Matter, but some are still holding a few cards close to their chest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye0GAi"&gt;Despite the coming together of the big four smart home companies and the general excitement of the early Matter push, the reality is the smart home will still be a divided one. Matter may provide a basic standard of interoperability and portability, but companies will still seek competitive advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hf077"&gt;For example, nothing in the Matter spec requires a Matter controller to support all device categories. If video doorbells become part of Matter in the future, Amazon could choose not to support doorbells in its controller. Amazon’s Ring doorbells already work in the Ring app and with its Echo devices, meaning the company may see no need to develop another doorbell camera controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14a8Uc"&gt;There’s also nothing compelling companies to upgrade products that they don’t want to. Google has said it will update its newest Nest Smart Thermostat to Matter but has not said if any of the three generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat or the Thermostat E will follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9K51y"&gt;Amazon has released a slew of new smart home products in 2021, including a thermostat, air quality monitor, and smart switches, with not a mention of Matter compatibility. DeCenzo tells me this doesn’t mean it won’t come, but that’s not exactly a guarantee that it will. “It’s hard for a device maker to make any absolute statements about something they’re going to support that isn’t here today,” he says. “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSoSVS"&gt;Apple has committed to Matter but hasn’t commented on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;whether it will adopt the Matter TV and Streaming Video player specification&lt;/a&gt; to allow Matter controllers to cast content from smartphones to televisions, similar to how AirPlay works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvRGFc"&gt;On the one hand, companies are committing to Matter, but with the other hand they’re still holding some cards close to their chest. While it’s legitimately tricky to say how you will develop your products for a specification that hasn’t been finalized yet, these companies are all deeply involved in the process, so they are hardly flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9GBupl"&gt;How will companies differentiate themselves in Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1PALNF"&gt;Before Matter, compatibility was a huge selling point for devices. You bought a smart lock largely because it worked with your ecosystem of choice. With Matter, that reason should go away. Now, companies will need to innovate on top of the standard to create reasons for you to choose their devices over the competition. “What Matter does is change the game, so companies aren’t competing on connectivity and interoperability, and it’s just there,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at Connectivity Standards Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAJeQ"&gt;This would appear to put the big four smart home platforms on an even playing field. If all devices talk to each other, you’re no longer locked into Google’s ecosystem because your preferred door lock only works with Google. While this would seem counter to Google, Amazon etc. selling more devices, what it does is make it easier for each company to innovate and move forward with their respective visions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;smart home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEoO9"&gt;Ultimately, if the hardware is commoditized, the value becomes in the service layer your ecosystem of choice adds to your experience. Matter’s specifications are designed to be simple: that door lock will lock and unlock. “Above that, it’s up to the device makers, the platform companies and such to understand how to best innovate,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNHPu2ISjAQ9HIH0veWWCi2RLGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079853/acastro_4887_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQGuK0"&gt;If you want more advanced features — such as adaptive lighting or touch-to-unlock — you will go to a platform or manufacturer that supports those. “It will make for a more competitive environment,” says Kevin Kraus, of Yale Residential, part of Assa Abloy. “If you want a fully-featured door lock, you’re likely to buy a Yale lock. But let’s say you’ve got a shed, and you just need something that locks and unlocks, then you might go for something less sophisticated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQDR3K"&gt;Matter should push manufacturers to innovate, too. “We need to focus more on the added value of our products,” said Florian Deleuil of Netatmo in &lt;a href="https://matter-smarthome.de/en/interview-en/matter-is-pretty-changing-the-game/"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;. “Otherwise, it could end up being difficult to distinguish our product from that of cheaper and less innovative suppliers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzVx9B"&gt;While it will be more competitive, the thinking is that the market will be much larger. Matter will help the smart home go from niche to mass. “If this is successful, everyone sells more,” says Z-Wave’s Klein. “Market penetration increases, the stagnation of the smart home in terms of growth is going to increase, and new product categories will open up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNKvkw"&gt;Today, you might choose a washing machine because it has an excellent design, a special cycle for athletic wear, and offers good energy and water efficiency. You don’t choose it because it works with Alexa or syncs with your fridge. Going forward, that’s probably how you’ll choose your next smart device. “Both industrial design, the overall physical user experience, and the feature sets that they virtually interact with will drive purchase decisions, not just who it works with,” says Klein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bs8hP"&gt;Matter will also provide wider choice. Today, you may be limited to devices that work with the platform you have set up. With Matter, that restriction should go away. The smart home future — where all devices communicate with each other to help your home run more efficiently, intelligently, and seamlessly — will finally emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj5xICvNyLceaIMRUUBHTfPr1fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084331/matter_lkup_rgb_night.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bNpJsc"&gt;But will it Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IdBNMP"&gt;In all of the interviews I did for this article, no one had anything negative to say about Matter (on the record). Right now, the industry is aligned on drinking the same Kool-Aid. But Matter is still an idea — albeit one with an unprecedented industry coalition behind it that makes it the most promising development in the smart home since Alexa arrived on the scene. It’s easy to love an idea; it can be harder to implement and stick to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBsr0h"&gt;Matter’s biggest roadblock is that it’s not here yet, and whether it will arrive as promised is still a large question mark. This is holding some companies back from committing to it or developing products for it today. “We totally believe in the vision and in all the benefits that will come from having a single protocol,” says Amazon’s DeCenzo. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to get there. And that’s going to be a journey.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Rns5ld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work well with its platform? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt3pay"&gt;Fadell, who is as excited about the validation of his Thread gamble as a kid at Christmas, is also slightly skeptical. He worries that proprietary moves by companies looking to differentiate products could harm Matter’s overall promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niOU16"&gt;“Everything can talk to everything in Matter, but that doesn’t mean the experiences will be the same. I can speak French, but am I really French? No,” says Fadell. “It’s the same thing here. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, sure you may work with other systems in certain ways — but inside Apple, with all the Apple tools, it will be a better experience, and it’s going to stay that way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0NJ9"&gt;Yes, you will be able to use an Apple speaker to control an Amazon device, but is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; with its platform? “Unlikely,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP75wL"&gt;Ultimately, Matter isn’t the solution we — as consumers — have been waiting for. On day one, it’s not going to produce the ambient, self-aware smart home that can respond to your every need without a lick of set-up on our part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FQcQSu"&gt;What it is is the solution smart home developers need so that they can start building products and services for that smart home we’re waiting for. “If Matter only changes a couple of things, we will still have a fundamental new technology that works,” says Fadell. “And if it’s adopted — well, let’s see what happens then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCXfRy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How Amazon, Google, Apple, and Samsung will work with Matter, and which products you should buy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GabSAa"&gt;Matter, the coming smart home standard that aims to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22551770"&gt;the answer to many of today’s smart home headaches&lt;/a&gt;, is supported by a long list of companies. From platform owners like Apple, Google, and Amazon to major manufacturers such as Samsung and LG and smaller, accessory-focused players like Nanoleaf, Eve, and Wyze, there’s an unprecedented industry coalition behind Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="167Ytr"&gt;A common language for smart home devices to communicate, Matter aims to simplify everything about the smart home, from purchase, to set up, to everyday use. Its biggest promise is that it will enable smart devices to work with each other, across platforms and ecosystems, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MnDeS8"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4578799766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lutl1l"&gt;But Matter hasn’t yet arrived — it’s now expected to launch in mid-2022 — making it hard to determine how it will work in your home and what it will allow you to do that isn’t easy or even possible today. To answer some of these questions we’ve gathered information from published documents and talked to the companies that plan to support it and the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (CSA) that oversees Matter.&lt;/p&gt;

As new information comes out, we’ll keep this article updated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQDCM2XNmiFedkryyuLbBkZf71k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858528/Apple_HomePod_mini_iPad_iPhone_applewatch_airpods_10132020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has committed to supporting Matter products in its HomeKit smart home platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="S7Ne2e"&gt;Which platforms will work with Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="qVMRLo"&gt;The four big smart home platforms, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and Samsung SmartThings, have all committed to supporting Matter, which means you will be able to use their apps, smart speakers / displays, and smart voice assistants as Matter controllers to managed your connected devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F25agy"&gt;Bear in mind, though, these won’t be the only players that can run your smart home with Matter, and as more information emerges around how other ecosystems will support Matter we’ll add that here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49W3b3"&gt;With Matter, you can use multiple platforms at the same time because of a feature called Multi-Admin control. As long as devices and platforms are Matter-enabled, you can connect them to as many platforms as you want. So, yes, you will be able to control the new Nest Thermostat with Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa voice assistants, even both at the same time if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBefjC"&gt;But you will still need to use a smart home platform; Matter is not an automation tool, it’s a connectivity standard. While Matter will have some basic controls built in, it isn’t capable of creating automations, such as setting your thermostat to turn down, your lights to turn off, and the door to lock when you leave home — you’ll still need an app for that type of automation setup. However, with Matter, those automations will run across devices from different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjwIlN"&gt;Here is a rundown of what each of the smart home platforms has committed to in terms of Matter support in its products and services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZZYvfP"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cLXJ2K"&gt;Amazon has committed to upgrading its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;fourth-generation Echo smart speaker to Thread&lt;/a&gt; and act as a border router. Thread is a primary protocol used by Matter and a border router is a bridge between a Thread network and a Wi-Fi network, the other protocol used by Matter. Amazon’s mesh Wi-Fi network company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero has committed to supporting Matter&lt;/a&gt;, too. Most of its existing routers already have Thread radios inside, so they can be upgraded to support Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1kwXl"&gt;The Echos with Zigbee on board — the Echo Studio, Echo Show 10, and Echo Plus — have the same radio as the Echo fourth-gen, so they are potentially upgradable to be Thread border routers, says Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126. This is because Thread and is built on a Zigbee radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCMMvB"&gt;DeCenzo confirmed that the rest of the current Echo speaker line up will be upgraded to support Matter over Wi-Fi. “All of the Echo devices will be able to control all of the Matter devices that are on your home network, regardless of what networking technology they happen to use,” he says. The &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/matter"&gt;company has also said it will work with developers&lt;/a&gt; to help them develop products and skills for the Alexa smart home that will integrate easily with Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGYWIVPY2ntLUniO0QjQaOR7mkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19170903/dseifert_190905_3634_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Nest Hub Max has a Thread radio inside and will be upgraded to Matter and serve as a border router and Matter controller, according to Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="K1laCp"&gt;Google Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OnQcE4"&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444571/google-interconnected-matter-smart-home-standard-android-nest-details-io-2021"&gt;committed to updating all its Nest smart speakers and displays&lt;/a&gt; to Matter, and said that newer products with Thread built in — such as the Nest Wi-Fi, Nest Hub Max, and second-gen Nest Hub — will also serve as border routers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6yynh"&gt;Interestingly, the Nest x Yale Lock has a Thread radio inside, as do all the wired Nest Protect smoke alarms, the Nest Learning Thermostat (all three generations), and the original wired Nest cameras. However, Google told me that just because a device has Thread doesn’t necessarily mean it will be Matter compatible. “Our goal is to make as many of our products Matter compatible as possible,” says Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google. “But much of that will be dependent on the technology needed by the protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5M5PU"&gt;Similarly, Google has said it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"&gt;support developers who make products for its platform to integrate those with Matter&lt;/a&gt; via a Google Home Device SDK for Matter. It also plans to update its mobile devices with Matter support to control Matter devices and allow for Matter’s streamlined device set-up process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3U62vs"&gt;Apple HomeKit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mkEFtJ"&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) both have Thread radios inside, can work as Thread border routers and will get Matter support. Apple has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10298/"&gt;committed to supporting Matter&lt;/a&gt; on the Home app and through Siri on Apple devices. The company has also said that all existing &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"&gt;HomeKit APIs will automatically work with Matter-enabled accessories&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hz2vxT"&gt;“We believe all smart home accessories should work together to provide the most choice and interoperability for customers without compromising security and privacy,” Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me. “This is why we helped create and contribute to the new Matter standard so that all smart home accessories will have the same level of security, privacy, and ease of use that Apple customers enjoy today with HomeKit accessories.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mmIaYV"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"&gt;said it will upgrade all existing SmartThings hubs to support Matter&lt;/a&gt; and enable Matter as a controller for its smartphones, smart TVs, and smart appliances (such as its Family Hub refrigerators). It has yet to confirm if this will be over Thread or Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Au6Ep"&gt;“We’re very excited about the future and utilizing Matter as a central thought for us around what the future smart home looks like,” says Samantha Fein, Vice President of Business Development and Marketing at SmartThings.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A number of Nanoleaf’s products have Thread radios, and the company has said they will be upgraded to Matter when the standard arrives. Its Elements LED wall panels (pictured) will also work as Thread border routers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sCWUu8"&gt;Which products will work with Matter, and when can I buy them?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="bO50Dm"&gt;While you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Thread-Benefits"&gt;Thread products today&lt;/a&gt; from Eve, Nanoleaf, Eero, WeMo, and Nest — and there are plenty of Wi-Fi-enabled smart home devices out there — Matter products don’t exist yet. They won’t until the standard is finalized next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNLTMM"&gt;However, many companies have committed to supporting Matter in existing and forthcoming products. When they do, you will know if a product you’re considering buying is Matter compatible if it has the Matter logo (which looks a bit like a &lt;a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/news/project-chi-new-name-matter-2622"&gt;stick-person wearing bikini bottoms&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJFsm"&gt;Matter 1.0, the first Matter spec, includes these connected device categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dt3YCb"&gt;Lightbulbs, light switches, lighting controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GyBRxV"&gt;Plugs and outlets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HnkszA"&gt;Door locks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BOAvFY"&gt;Thermostats and other HVAC controllers (mini-splits etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GyKaEy"&gt;Blinds and shades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0jyqlF"&gt;Home security sensors (motion, contact, CO / smoke detectors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FaMOw0"&gt;Garage door controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nIU45S"&gt;Wireless Access Point and bridges&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8lVDrX"&gt;Work has already begun on Matter 1.1, Matter 2.0, and beyond. Robot vacuums, home appliances, EV charging, and smart energy management are all likely to be in Matter 1.1, says Chris LaPré, chief technology officer of the CSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBjvzl400OzMIQsaiMDthMbPZkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22881764/20210621_us_lifestyle_insitu_alarmpro_keypad_credenza_rgb_16x9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Ring Alarm Pro from the Amazon-owned company does not support Matter over Thread, says the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="jpYOu6"&gt;Which products won’t work with Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5PrpZq"&gt;While the list of devices Matter will support initially is impressive, the big question is what about smart security cameras? Easily one of the most popular devices in the smart home, a smart home standard without security cameras feels incomplete. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Cameras are probably 2.0,” says LaPré. “We know we will do cameras — all the companies have said they want to do cameras. But we need a quorum of people that are willing to start working on it today, and the ones that would be are currently focused on 1.0.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeyyZi"&gt;In the same vein, while home security sensors are part of Matter, home security systems are not — yet. Many smart homes run with an alarm system as the main hub, so the lack of integration here could be a deal-breaker for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meA5MK"&gt;Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance — a technology used widely in home alarm systems for door / window sensors, motion sensors, and other devices — explains that there will be significant challenges to porting that technology to Matter. “Securing UL approval for security devices is exceptionally difficult, and Matter has numerous challenges here,” he says. “UL is a benchmark and often an insurance requirement. All professionally-installed security systems insist on UL approval.” UL (formerly called Underwriters Laboratories) is part of the CSA, however, and we can assume it’s working toward integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SODx2n"&gt;Speaking of cameras and alarm systems, one of the biggest smart home companies in both these spaces — Ring — hasn’t offered any indication it will support Matter. When I asked how / if Ring Alarm might integrate into Matter, a spokesperson provided the following statement: “Ring Alarm Pro does not support Matter over Thread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="MyBfao"&gt;Is Matter going to keep my smart home private and secure? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NyZeZC"&gt;Smart home adoption has been seriously hampered by concerns about privacy and security, and keeping devices secure is &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;a core tenant of Matter&lt;/a&gt;. “We are secure by design, we take a zero-trust approach, we use specific industry-standard encryption technology, and every device gets authenticated before it joins the network,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at CSA. “Every message is secured on the network, and Matter supports secure over-the-air updates.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRqGMA"&gt;In terms of your home’s data, that relationship remains between you and the individual manufacturers, says Mindala-Freeman. However, &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s Privacy Principles&lt;/a&gt; outline data privacy protections, including minimizing how much data is shared in any Matter interaction and defining the purpose of data sharing when requested. As a bonus, because Matter has trust built into the system, you won’t have to continually input your passwords to connect ecosystems, explains the CSA’s LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2EIlm"&gt;The significant advantage of Matter devices, direct IP control that lets them speak straight to the internet, is at the same time a possible security concern. “This exposes them to hacking, malware, etc.,” said Mitch Klein of Z-Wave Alliance. With Z-Wave and Zigbee systems, you have a single point of control to secure: the hub — whereas a single point of securing the home is the opposite of what Matter is doing, Klein points out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUWHSm"&gt;The CSA says &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is more modern, delivering security that is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time) and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. The approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world, “rather than security by obscurity.” Until devices are out in the wild, it’s hard to confirm this approach’s proficiency, but the intent checks all the right boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="philips hue" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wBijTaQpzCRMvJoNzLgRsflqiNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4124096/D2-Heart-of-your-Hue-system-square-2.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips Hue&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philips Hue smart lighting line will be upgraded to Matter through its existing bridge, according to the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mEr5qU"&gt;Will I need to replace my existing smart devices to use Matter? &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1Fr5p9"&gt;From the beginning, Matter has been designed to include those connected devices already in our homes. “We can’t leave devices behind, or this whole program won’t work,” says Klein. “The idea that everyone has to throw everything out and start again is just not going to work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnlhnX"&gt;Newer Wi-Fi or Thread devices and those that work over Z-Wave and Zigbee should be upgradable to Matter. This can happen in two ways: upgrading the device directly over the air or a software upgrade for a product’s existing bridge — &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210512-complete-philips-hue-range-to-be-compatible-with-new-smart-home-connectivity-standard-matter"&gt;Philips Hue has already committed to this for its smart lighting line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR5Twe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the long run, Matter will take over, and eventually, you’ll just get rid of all the bridges.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3DtIvL"&gt;Bluetooth devices that don’t rely on bridges, such as Eve’s line of security and sensor products, will need hardware upgrades, meaning older devices won’t be compatible. Eve has already rolled out upgraded hardware for its Bluetooth products and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;committed to having everything Thread-enabled by next year&lt;/a&gt;, ready for Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyhL6q"&gt;Existing Zigbee and Z-Wave devices are unlikely to be upgraded individually — because they can’t communicate directly to the internet. Despite Thread being based on Zigbee, very few devices with Zigbee radios will be upgradable directly. “IPv6 carries a heavy software burden and the majority of Zigbee devices out there could not support [that],” says Klein. But the hubs these devices communicate through can be upgraded or bridged to Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA3sGH"&gt;But going forward, the Matter smart home should be bridge-free. “Matter is going to be cheaper for device makers, it’s going to be cheaper for Philips, for example, to make an IP-based bulb [than continue to build bridges],” says LaPré. “So, in the long run, Matter will take over, and eventually, you’ll just get rid of all the bridges.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmRJ2-4XCAJgc7bv5uCtOORQiXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21977839/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo smart speaker (fourth-gen) is the only one Amazon has confirmed it’s upgrading to Matter so far, but it says others will be coming soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PPefPz"&gt;Should I wait for Matter to buy new smart home products?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="DtH8AA"&gt;This promise of future upgradability means you don’t need to wait for Matter to buy new devices, says Mindala-Freeman. “You should, with confidence, continue to develop your own smart home and smart environment,” they claim. But, as anyone who has bought a smart device knows, the promise of future software updates is not one to bet your house against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pDDCq"&gt;Still, the message from the industry is don’t stop buying devices altogether. Our advice is to consider products with Thread radios in them first, then Wi-Fi, as both of these have a clear upgrade path. If that doesn’t suit your immediate needs, look for products with hubs or bridges that contain either protocol. Beyond that, research the company you’re considering buying from to see if it has made any commitment to Matter — but proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z83JLG"&gt;If you are itching to get started with your Matter smart home, the best device to buy now would be a Thread border router. Products are currently available from Apple, Nanoleaf, Eero, and Eve, with support coming to Amazon Alexa and Google Home smart speakers and displays later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uihsmd"&gt;While Matter will work over Thread and Wi-Fi — meaning you don’t have to have a border router to use the standard — adding one (or more) will help ensure you have a solid foundation on which to build a Matter-supported home. Because Thread is a mesh network the more devices you have on it the better the range and reliability will be. A border router will bridge your Thread and Wi-Fi devices, ensuring everything in your home can talk to each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CT5l2T"&gt;Fortunately, a border router is not a bridge in the traditional plug-a-white-box-into-your-router sense. They don’t need an ethernet connection, they just need continuous power and Wi-Fi connectivity. This means a border router can really be anything from a smart plug or smart speaker to a fridge, television or thermostat. Finally, the smart home is starting to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KO2UsiRk_sylLL1GCQvDsU23Fq0=/1x0:2040x1359/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/VRG_ILLO_4902_SECURE_TWITTER.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can’t keep Twitter out of your data completely, but you can lessen the damage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of your information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a few minutes to find them and turn them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXpKGc"&gt;There is a single page on the web where you can find a lot of the settings, called the “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt;” page. Unfortunately, that page no longer seems to be available on the mobile app. So while we’ll initially discuss the settings as found on the web page, I’ll also tell you how to get to each feature on mobile. (To get to any of the mobile settings, you’ll always start by tapping on your personal icon in the upper left corner.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87rMEq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZZUCLB02fnkc5Cg51cBnkbMINI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025630/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNsoti"&gt;If you’re using the mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bou6OE"&gt;Find “Personalized ads” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Ads preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zJi3kO"&gt;Find “Personalize based on your inferred identity” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ajPoAd"&gt;Find “Personalize based on places you’ve been” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NZfBbK"&gt;Find “Allow use of where you see Twitter content across the web” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Off-Twitter activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9vXMOx"&gt;Find “Allow additional information sharing with business partners” by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Data sharing with business partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M6gpp3"&gt;Find “Personalize based on precise location” (which is not available on the web settings) by going to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Location information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="O5scKT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each (along with directions if you’re using the mobile app).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.) In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Account information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas: a listing of other accounts that have access to your account, and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account and shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access. In the mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what Twitter meant when it asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here. This info can also be found in your mobile app under: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Security and account access &amp;gt; Apps and sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted. On your mobile app: Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Mute and block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLh0uFDEVnMduIatE8w4GIZbzT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025633/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_4.29.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t find anything similar using the mobile app, but you can go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Privacy and safety &amp;gt; Content you see &amp;gt; Topics. There you’ll see some of the topics you’ve followed and that Twitter suggests you might want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity. In your mobile app, go to Settings and privacy &amp;gt; Your account &amp;gt; Download an archive of your data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Say goodbye to your favorite podcast promo codes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Promo codes helped build an industry, now big brands are moving in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="56ikLh"&gt;Füm is the type of product that traditionally sells well through podcast ads. It’s a smoking cessation device, and when paired with a podcaster who uses it themselves, people buy. That’s why Adam McNeil, PR manager at the company, says he went from spending $3,000 per month on podcast ads at the beginning of this year to between $25,000 and $30,000 by the end. “It’s become our number one revenue source,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiJ4HT"&gt;McNeil is one of many direct response advertisers who’ve found a home in podcasting. You’re likely familiar with the others: Mailchimp, Casper, Manscaped, Tommy John, and any other that relies on promo codes. They’re synonymous with the industry. But in a year filled with indie shows going to big networks in eye-popping, multimillion-dollar deals, as well as a broader push from tech companies to make money off the space, these direct response advertisers say they’re getting priced or pushed out while the aspects they’ve come to know and love about the industry are disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YH40Y"&gt;McNeil, for example, says the cost to advertise doubled on one of his brand’s go-to shows after it was acquired — although so far, they’ve honored his prior price point. The appeal of advertising on the show has waned, however, because the hosts pack more advertisers into the same amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfUEIV"&gt;“If there’s only a few ads on the episode, it seems a little less intrusive to the listener, but all of a sudden, now there’s four, maybe five, on that episode,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxmX2C"&gt;Although the changes are often positioned as good for podcasters and the industry itself — more people are making money and attracting advertiser interest — this also comes with a compromise, the loss of the tight relationships between direct response brands and podcasters. The thing that helped make podcasting what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y54iz5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Advertisers say the experience of buying and distributing an ad is getting worse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q2gnt5"&gt;Another advertiser, who asked to remain anonymous over fears of straining their industry relationships, echoed McNeil. “We did have a show that we really loved working with,” they say. “It wasn’t small, but it was part of a smaller network, and everything about that felt like a true partnership. It did not feel like it was a transactional sale from a salesperson.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCK3ZX"&gt;The partnership was a “smash success” from the get-go, they say, with the team reaching their goals in half the time it typically takes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YRwhL"&gt;That all changed when that show got acquired. “I was just shocked by the difference,” they say. No longer could they switch out ad copy for a campaign that would run over three months. “If we’re not spending like half a million dollars, you don’t care if your listeners get sick of hearing our ads?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYZjb8"&gt;Plus, the show’s team previously guided them on how to create the best ad to talk to that specific audience, and the hands-on help no longer came with the amount the brand spent. Their embedded tracker wasn’t even configured correctly to determine how many people heard the ad. “It was like pulling teeth” to get everything in order to just run a successful podcast ad. The brand didn’t re-up their contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxnlHA"&gt;“I found that the larger companies are probably a lot more willing to just take your money and let you fail, or let it just happen,” McNeil adds. “The smaller networks are a lot more keen on trying to make sure that it’s a win for you, so that you renew the contract for four months, six months, a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3u1prj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ljRCTG"&gt;The issue is only becoming more pressing for both advertisers and show publishers. Acquisitions and licensing agreements occur regularly now, often with big price tags attached. This year, Amazon Music acquired &lt;em&gt;SmartLess&lt;/em&gt; in a deal reportedly worth as much as $80 million while Spotify is exclusively licensing &lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt; for a reported $60 million. Meanwhile, Vox Media, which owns &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt;, acquired Criminal Productions, capping off a year of acquisitions and partnerships that included Cafe Studios, &lt;em&gt;Longform&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gastropod&lt;/em&gt;. Also, SiriusXM acquired &lt;em&gt;99% Invisible&lt;/em&gt; from Roman Mars. Much of the impetus behind these deals is not only to buy reputable and far-reaching programs, but to also bulk up ad inventory. The publishers then, of course, are incentivized to make back the cash they spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ6NjT"&gt;One ad buyer, who also requested anonymity to speak freely about rates, says Spotify upped prices for its acquired and licensed shows. CPMs, or the cost per thousand listeners, on those programs are up three times as much, they say. A host-read ad that lived forever on Joe Rogan’s show used to cost tens of thousands of dollars previous to him going exclusive to Spotify. Next year, to get any ads on Rogan, the minimum spend is $1 million, they say, at a CPM upward of $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi8YqD"&gt;To which Spotify spokeswoman Erin Styles says, “We believe the many innovations taking shape will benefit the entire marketplace, including creators and advertisers, and we’re confident that advertisers of all sizes will continue to find immense value in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D3NVTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An ad on Joe Rogan’s show, prior his Spotify deal, lived on an episode forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QbSgqQ"&gt;Meanwhile, a separate podcaster who signed on with a big network says a buyout of their show now sells for five to 10 times more than they were charging on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQPGjb"&gt;“[Prior to all these acquisitions, advertisers] could be a mogul and be sitting on hundreds of personalities that could only advocate for [their] business, and it was performing, and it was building the brand,” says Dan Granger, founder and CEO of ad agency Oxford Road. “Then you start selling companies for $300 million with these really generous multiples, and all of a sudden, at some point, they’re going to have to show a return on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIwTTd"&gt;This leads to a world in which direct response advertisers not only lose access to the programming or treatment they once enjoyed but have to contend with bigger brands dominating the space because they can afford the more expensive ads. Magellan AI tracks the brands spending the most on podcast ads per month, and the top &lt;a href="https://www.magellan.ai/pages/top-15-podcast-advertisers-october-2021"&gt;10 list from October&lt;/a&gt; includes, yes, some brands one might expect, like HelloFresh and ZipRecruiter, but also Fortune 500 companies, like Capital One and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwOb0f"&gt;“The large brand advertisers that are advertising across television and radio and Pandora and Spotify are also looking for that type of scale that now podcasting, because it has grown so much, can provide,” says Greg Leader, SVP of advertising partnerships at SXM Media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVFPjN"&gt;These brand advertisers also often care more about putting their name into the world rather than literally selling a product, which changes the stakes of the marketing game. No more promo codes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="V5NbtM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More brands have come to podcasting, including Fortune 500 companies with bigger budgets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9daLm"&gt;Alongside this broader change in the types of advertisers filtering into the space comes a push for, as Leader mentioned, scale, or the ability to reach lots of people quickly. To make their money back and maximize revenue, publishers are encouraging dynamic ad insertion, meaning ads aren’t baked into a program, as well as programmatic ads that aren’t inserted into specific shows necessarily but included based on audience targeting. The thing the direct response advertisers loved about the space — the baked-in, host-read ads that lived on forever as testimonials — are dissipating, at least at the space’s highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G523lY"&gt;McNeil, for example, says Füm advertises on a YouTube-distributed show and one episode reached a million views. It normally banks around 100,000. Füm paid for those 100,000 impressions, technically, but ended up with way more exposure because the ad lived on forever. “You lose that opportunity to go viral the moment you do dynamic ad insertion,” he says. Once the promised impressions are reached, an ad is swapped out for a different brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feQqWx"&gt;Which isn’t to say everyone feels for these advertisers. Maybe they had it too good, or maybe they purposely undervalued the podcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9G8I5"&gt;“It’s the cycle of life,” Granger says. “You move to a cool, new neighborhood, and there’s an art gallery, and there’s some microbreweries, and there’s craftsmanship and products. Then there’s Starbucks, and then the place gets gentrified, and then everybody complains that it lost its edge. And then one day, there’s Walmart. And like, yeah, this is life. It doesn’t mean that you can’t get what you need, but if you think the street is going to be all noncorporate independent? No, the big money’s going to come, and they’re going to occupy the most real estate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="rc1kMD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drgNR5"&gt;Others think this situation is good news for podcasting as a growing, more profitable space. “I think of our industry kind of like an island being fueled by the volcano that’s underneath, adding more magma each year,” says John Goforth, CRO of Magellan AI. “The square footage is getting bigger and bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AEcQw"&gt;Multiple people I spoke with suggest the industry is merely stratifying — the top shows are going exclusive in million-plus-dollar deals, cutting off access to the protein shake makers of the world while smaller, newer podcasters stream in, hoping for the protein shake makers to buy an ad. The direct response advertisers, they say, should look in new places and for new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyRmOh"&gt;“There’s always going to be somebody coming up in the world before they get picked off by Spotify,” Granger says. “And [the advertisers are] just going to have to surf on those, they’re going to have to keep riding those waves, but it’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FC0w9Z"&gt;The question is whether the advertisers who helped build the space are willing and able to find a place on these newer shows, or if the podcasting industry’s onward march means leaving the mattress sellers behind.&lt;/p&gt;
