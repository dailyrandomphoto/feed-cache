    <title>Windows 11 will be able to sideload Android apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AtMLkZBo7x32ue8iMQZbn6VGzWo=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505476/MicrosoftTeams_image_1_1024x683.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gy4VSF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1408222245265330178?s=20"&gt;According to an engineer at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, Windows 11 users will have the ability to sideload Android apps onto the operating system, which looks like an answer to one of the biggest questions we had when Microsoft announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;bringing Android apps to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; via the Amazon Appstore (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/25/microsoft-engineer-windows-11-will-let-you-sideload-android-apps/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This means that once Windows 11 launches, you won’t just have to stick to the apps that Amazon makes available, but it does raise some new questions about how running Android apps on Windows will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cgITs"&gt;For example, it’s unclear what the process for running or installing a sideloaded app will be. Chrome OS technically has the ability to run sideloaded apps, too, but &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/arc/development-environment"&gt;the process isn’t exactly easy&lt;/a&gt;, as it involves enabling Linux and doing some command line work. We asked Microsoft for details about what running Android apps from outside the Amazon Appstore would be like, but we haven’t gotten a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DEnJrO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sideloading apps solves the app availability problem, but it raises concerns of its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8fMFu"&gt;It’s possible that the desire for sideloading apps onto Windows wouldn’t be as strong had Microsoft included Google’s Play Store instead of Amazon’s Appstore. While having any app store will obviously grant Windows users access to many programs that they couldn’t previously run on their computers, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1408088973830991876?s=20"&gt;has some notable omissions from its catalog&lt;/a&gt;. If a Windows user wanted to run the Android version of Snapchat or Apple Music, they wouldn’t be able to get them from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQPF9i"&gt;While sideloading apps helps solve this problem, it does raise concerns of its own. The first is the question of where users will obtain those apps: while there aren’t likely to be piracy concerns with free apps like Snapchat, the ability to load an APK could allow people to get paid apps for free from less-than-legal repositories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZO30K"&gt;There’s also the question of safety and whether Windows will have the ability to scan sideloaded apps for potentially malicious behavior, a feature that Google builds into Android already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kumI5P"&gt;While it’s clear that there’s still a lot that Microsoft hasn’t covered about what running Android apps on Windows 11’s will actually be like (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549303/windows-11-intel-bridge-android-apps-amd-arm-processors"&gt;the technical details it’s revealed&lt;/a&gt; are fascinating), it’s still good to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1408203218492997634?s=20"&gt;have confirmation from someone at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; that the selection of Android apps won’t just be limited to what’s on Amazon’s Appstore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pZs6c"&gt;Hopefully Microsoft will start sharing more details on exactly how Android apps will work soon so it can get feedback from both Windows users and Android developers before the feature becomes available for everyone, likely later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report on an app that turns intelligence gathering into gig work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XCfVl78QqIW1zBPUfKsZraC-g4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505461/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9Okiw"&gt;Smartphones helped popularize the modern gig economy, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/app-taps-unwitting-users-abroad-to-gather-open-source-intelligence-11624544026"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests some companies like Premise have found a new way to take advantage of workers trying to make extra money — turning them into unwitting spies for corporate and military clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZegscY"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Byron Tau writes, Premise was originally started “to register prices in the developing world and help its customers better understand the needs of the population.” But the company reportedly found even more success having contributors perform TaskRabbit and Mechanical Turk-esque work like completing surveys, taking photos of locations, and walking specific paths, while occasionally scooping up information about nearby Wi-Fi networks and cell towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkEFnI"&gt;That might not immediately send up the biggest red flags, but Premise was also apparently paying contributors in Afghanistan to identify and photograph Shiite mosques in the city of Kabul, which is hard to not see as a little suspicious. Premise told Tau that photographing religious sites is a standard task used “to help clients understand the physical and social geography of a place,” but the Premise contributor Tau spoke to was concerned they had been asked to complete tasks that involved spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UZmjs"&gt;Needless to say, there’s a lot about Premise’s clients and proposed business partners (hint: some of them own fighter jets) that seem at least somewhat concerning, even if on paper Premise can claim it’s not running a distributed CIA. If you want the story in all its surprising horror, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/app-taps-unwitting-users-abroad-to-gather-open-source-intelligence-11624544026"&gt;you should read the full report&lt;/a&gt; for all the information Tau dug up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is deleting Internet Explorer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="internet explorer 9 logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5TXi9_Gp0jec7lU7J6qzkvao7U=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69505443/ie9logo.1419971092.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;internet explorer 9 logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6p5WeO"&gt;At one point in Windows 10’s lifetime, you could have had Internet Explorer, the legacy version of Microsoft Edge, and the new Chromium-powered Edge all installed. This trio of browsers was the perfect illustration of Microsoft’s struggles with the web over the past decade, but now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443997/microsoft-internet-explorer-end-of-support-date"&gt;Internet Explorer is being laid to rest in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, it’s disappearing from Windows 11, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC4bGe"&gt;Microsoft revealed yesterday that Internet Explorer will be “disabled” in Windows 11. At first, I was worried that it meant Internet Explorer might hang around ahead of the final nail in its coffin on June 15th, 2022, but it’s actually fully disappearing from Windows 11. “The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will not be available on Windows 11. Microsoft Edge is the default browser for Windows 11,” explains a Microsoft spokesperson to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The MSHTML engine exists as part of the Windows 11 operating system to power IE mode in Microsoft Edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_pssRSwFPrLsVC5jjjb3NOcqzs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681927/windows11ie.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet Explorer doesn’t launch in the leaked copy of Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZssqJa"&gt;We weren’t expecting Internet Explorer to appear in Windows 11, but Microsoft did warn that the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) of Windows 10 would still include Internet Explorer next year despite a consumer removal planned for June 15th, 2022. Windows 11 will now fully remove the browser, and if you use shortcuts like iexplore, then you’ll now be redirected to Microsoft Edge instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgFf0X"&gt;It’s the first time Microsoft hasn’t bundled Internet Explorer with a new version of Windows for more than 20 years. If memory serves me correct, the Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.5 in 1997 was the first time Microsoft explicitly bundled Internet Explorer into Windows Explorer and other key parts of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zpm149"&gt;That bundling led to the infamous &lt;em&gt;United States v. Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; antitrust battle just a year after Internet Explorer’s debut in October 1997. The rest, as they say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards"&gt;is history&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NtSjoT"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows operating system has been a major presence in the computer industry for decades. Currently, PCs loaded with Windows 10 are being manufactured and sold by a variety of companies in an even wider variety of models. Come the 2021 holiday season, we can expect that PCs will be shipping with Microsoft’s new Windows 11 — and if your current system is compatible, you will be able to upgrade to the new free OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7hC5d1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KgK2IK"&gt;This abundance of choice has its advantages and disadvantages. While on the one hand, it means you can get a system that is exactly tailored to your needs, it also means you need to do some research before deciding on which Windows device is right for you. And while the operating system’s flexibility is an advantage, especially if you are tech-savvy or business-oriented, it also means finding features — and fixing problems — can be a complicated process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IQYud"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Guide to Windows is where you can find expert info and advice on topics such as how to change your sign-in settings, how to use the Windows Edge browser to protect your privacy, and how to take full advantage of the upgrade to Windows 11. So if you’re a confirmed Windows maven or new to the OS, let us keep you informed and up to date on the latest devices and techniques.

    <title>Why Windows 11 is forcing everyone to use TPM chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tErjIeOi0dqDJILpD1cCV_7KKsQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504823/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yqWTro"&gt;Microsoft announced yesterday that Windows 11 will require TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chips on existing and new devices. It’s a significant hardware change that has been years in the making, but Microsoft’s messy way of communicating this has left many confused about whether their hardware is compatible. What is a TPM, and why do you need one for Windows 11 anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2pQfb"&gt;“The Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) is a chip that is either integrated into your PC’s motherboard or added separately into the CPU,” &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F06%2F25%2Fwindows-11-enables-security-by-design-from-the-chip-to-the-cloud%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explains David Weston&lt;/a&gt;, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft. “Its purpose is to protect encryption keys, user credentials, and other sensitive data behind a hardware barrier so that malware and attackers can’t access or tamper with that data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vTirEX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 is free, but your CPU might not be officially supported ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OQphEK"&gt;So it’s all about security. TPMs work by offering hardware-level protection instead of software only. It can be used to encrypt disks using Windows features like BitLocker, or to prevent dictionary attacks against passwords. TPM 1.2 chips have existed since 2011, but they’ve typically only been used widely in IT-managed business laptops and desktops. Microsoft wants to bring that same level of protection to everyone using Windows, even if it’s &lt;a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/bitlocker-sleep-mode-vulnerability-can-bypass-windows-full-disk-encryption"&gt;not always perfect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBna7U_j3oWLNtBmFiubpY3vdXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681635/tpmchip.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dedicated TPM chip you probably don’t actually need for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hX28nA"&gt;Microsoft has been &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F30%2Fnew-security-signals-study-shows-firmware-attacks-on-the-rise-heres-how-microsoft-is-working-to-help-eliminate-this-entire-class-of-threats%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warning for months&lt;/a&gt; that firmware attacks are on the rise. “Our own Security Signals report found that 83 percent of businesses experienced a firmware attack, and only 29 percent are allocating resources to protect this critical layer,” says Weston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NczTiG"&gt;That 83 percent figure seems huge, but when you consider the various phishing, ransomware, supply chain, and IoT vulnerabilities that exist, the broad range of attacks becomes a lot clearer. Ransomware attacks hit the headlines weekly, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545675/ransomware-cryptocurrency-regulation-hacks"&gt;ransomware funds more ransomware so it’s a difficult problem to solve&lt;/a&gt;. TPMs will certainly help with certain attacks, but Microsoft is banking on a combination of modern CPUs, Secure Boot, and its set of virtualization protections to really make a dent in ransomware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjUKsl"&gt;Microsoft is trying to play its part, particularly as Windows is the platform that’s often most affected by these attacks. It’s widely used by businesses worldwide, and there are more than 1.3 billion Windows 10 machines in use today. Microsoft software has been at the core of devastating attacks that made global headlines, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;like the Russia-linked SolarWinds hack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;Hafnium hacks on Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt;. And while the company isn’t responsible for forcing its clients to keep its software patched, it’s trying to be more proactive about protection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQFFXgpRx2nyANrz1qgnEmfgM_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681637/Windows_11_PC_Devices.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is pushing modern Windows 11 PCs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnRMhA"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of struggling to move Windows into the future in both hardware and software, and this particular change hasn’t been explained well. While Microsoft has required OEMs to ship devices with support for TPM chips since Windows 10, the company hasn’t forced users or its many device partners to turn these on for Windows to work. That’s what’s really changing with Windows 11, and combined with Microsoft’s Windows 11 upgrade checker, it has resulted in a lot of understandable confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vphth"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11%23pchealthcheck" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows 11 website lists&lt;/a&gt; the minimum system requirements, with a link to &lt;a href="http://aka.ms/CPUlist"&gt;compatible CPUs&lt;/a&gt; and a clear mention that a TPM 2.0 is required at a minimum. (That may not actually be the case.) The PC Health Check app that Microsoft asks people to download and check to see if Windows 11 runs will flag systems that do not have Secure Boot or TPM support enabled or devices that have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;CPUs that aren’t officially supported&lt;/a&gt; (anything older than 8th Gen Intel chips).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmzreL"&gt;That’s left many trying to figure out if their device supports TPM or not, confusion with BIOS settings, and even people rushing to buy separate TPM modules they don’t need. Some are even scalping TPM 2.0 modules on eBay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5JQ4Ex"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to Windows 11, people are scalping TPM2.0 modules as well now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$24.90 ➡ $99.90 in just 12 hours &lt;a href="https://t.co/9TTHC2c47w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9TTHC2c47w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shen Ye (@shen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shen/status/1408284995131645956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zViYBC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Hn9rVlipwicJ:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/windows-11/+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;Hidden away on Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt; is what’s really happening here — or so we thought, until Microsoft &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/windows-11/"&gt;changed its page&lt;/a&gt; a couple hours after we published this story. According to the original version of the page, the true minimum requirements are TPM 1.2 and a 64-bit dual-core CPU that’s 1GHz or greater. Since TPM support can be enabled through practically any modern CPU in the BIOS settings of a machine, you shouldn’t need a separate module unless your CPU is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2g9flM"&gt;But the new page says it requires TPM 2.0 and an processor that Microsoft has explicitly certified as compatible — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;which might mean everything before an 8th Gen Intel Core and AMD Ryzen 2000 won’t work&lt;/a&gt;. We’re following up with Microsoft now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RNOS4n"&gt;Microsoft is promoting TPM 2.0 and performing checks for 8th Gen or newer Intel chips because these are the requirements for certified OEM hardware — the machines you’ll find in stores with an inevitable Windows 11 sticker. But Windows 11 will likely install on devices with TPM 1.2 enabled, and practically any CPU that meets the 64-bit dual-core 1GHz or above standard — you’ll just have to navigate a notification telling you the “upgrade is not advised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nXZuEk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;it’s not super obvious and every BIOS varies. On mine it’s literally just “PTT.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrmSGEgARN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CrmSGEgARN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1408209347914653706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvUZYX"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t even mention the TPM 1.2 minimum in its blog post &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F06%2F25%2Fwindows-11-enables-security-by-design-from-the-chip-to-the-cloud%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;outlining this new security effort today&lt;/a&gt;, nor does the company offer any details on the CPU support that many seem to be stumbling into. If you’re having issues with the PC Health App checker for Windows 11, make sure you have “PTT” on Intel systems enabled in the BIOS, or “PSP fTPM” on AMD devices. The company’s system checker should be less confusing soon, though: shortly after we published this story, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1408479215813480449"&gt;Weston tweeted that it will now be more specific&lt;/a&gt; about why your PC isn’t passing muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gx5Qm4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just made updates to the Windows 11 PC Health Check App. It now provides more detailed info on requirements not met. This should help in cases where folks assumed CPU compat issues were TPM related  &lt;a href="https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO"&gt;https://t.co/hTWMe16DWO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eZLTZMOdjT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eZLTZMOdjT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DWIZZZLE (@dwizzzleMSFT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1408479215813480449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jUPlfI"&gt;What Microsoft is trying to achieve here will benefit the Windows ecosystem in years to come, alongside its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571069/microsoft-pluton-processor-security-windows-pc"&gt;efforts for Xbox-like security on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft just totally dropped the ball on explaining that to everyone on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mG7EN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:26PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Microsoft updated its PC Health Check app, shortly after we published this story, to be more specific about why your computer isn’t meeting Windows 11 system requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYJRiF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 3:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that Microsoft has changed its compatibility page to mention TPM 2.0 as a requirement instead of TPM 1.2, and that specific CPUs may be a requirement. We’re getting to the bottom of this now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is warning users when its search results might be unreliable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tScRA_91bd-x49huKXHHZrozeeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504561/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fPdcrq"&gt;Google will now tell users when search results are rapidly changing around a breaking story. Some searches will now bring up a warning that “it looks like these results are changing quickly,” and a subheading will explain that “if this topic is new, it can sometimes take time for results to be added by reliable sources.” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-notice-search-rapidly-evolving-results/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company suggests that users might want to check back later when it’s found more results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDYFqV"&gt;The notice is initially appearing on US-based English-language results “when a topic is rapidly evolving and a range of sources hasn’t yet weighed in.” Google will expand the tool’s presence to other markets in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvKn2Q"&gt;“While Google Search will always be there with the most useful results we can provide, sometimes the reliable information you’re searching for just isn’t online yet,” the company explains. “This can be particularly true for breaking news or emerging topics, when the information that’s published first may not be the most reliable.” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/24/22549157/google-unreliable-search-results-changing-quickly-misinformation-conspiracy-theories"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; reported on&lt;/a&gt; the feature yesterday, following up on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noUpside/status/1407724577120165890"&gt;a tweet from&lt;/a&gt; Stanford Internet Observatory researcher Renee DiResta. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Google search result for “ufo filmed traveling 106 mph” with the warning label." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df4jsFyslSYhbJZTSsPjjIRvMl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681491/Screen_Shot_2021_06_24_at_2.59.58_PM.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h7jiDc"&gt;A sample Google search screenshot features the query “ufo filmed traveling 106 mph,” an apparent reference to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/3133158/ufo-video-police-helicopter-wales-uk/"&gt;tabloid story&lt;/a&gt; about a 2016 UFO sighting in Wales. (Currently, that precise search result does not actually include the warning.) “Someone had gotten this police report video released out in Wales, and it’s had a little bit bit of press coverage. But there’s still not a lot about it,” Google search public liaison Danny Sullivan told &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;. “But people are probably searching for it, they may be going around on social media — so we can tell it’s starting to trend. And we can also tell that there’s not a lot of necessarily great stuff that’s out there. And we also think that maybe new stuff will come along.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rf21cA"&gt;That whimsical example aside, Google has inadvertently showcased incorrect information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16413082/google-4chan-las-vegas-shooting-top-stories-algorithm-mistake"&gt;after mass shooting events&lt;/a&gt; — where early official reports are often inaccurate and deliberate misinformation is common. (This is sometimes exacerbated &lt;a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids-where-missing-data-can-easily-be-exploited/"&gt;by “data voids,”&lt;/a&gt; or keywords that have few search results and can be easily hijacked by bad actors.) This warning won’t necessarily stop bad content from surfacing, and it’s not clear exactly how Google determines a sufficient range of sources. But it could remove some of the false legitimacy that high Google placement can confer on early, unreliable search results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about the Pentagon’s big UFO report... for now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGjUQ6Q1lGKJM1OZDqPTf7C6PMo=/0x251:1454x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504421/Screen_Shot_2021_06_25_at_7.57.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Department of Defense/US Navy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For those who feel abducted by the recent UFO hype, this one’s for you &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Jz1cto"&gt;A highly anticipated report on the Pentagon’s research into Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), aka UFOs, will be released as early as today. There’s going to be a book-load of background on the Pentagon’s new UAP task force, which examines unknown objects through a national security lens. The Defense Department said last year it takes “any incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace very seriously...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMQQlN"&gt;The government’s UAP program and the upcoming report have spawned a news cycle that has shot UFO conspiracies back into the mainstream. Despite the hype, the report will almost certainly not contain proof of aliens. Here’s what we know so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9roQWH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will this Pentagon UFO report come out? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg1oZr"&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee squeezed in a comment within last year’s massive COVID-19 relief bill that &lt;a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/intelligence-authorization-act-fiscal-year-2021"&gt;asked the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; to cough up classified and unclassified versions of a UAP report in 180 days, or no later than Friday, June 25th. So it’s coming very soon. By Thursday, the unclassified version hadn’t been finished yet and was expected to be posted online by the deadline on Friday, one Defense Department press officer said at the time.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F4tL0R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UAP? Why not say UFO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFPuor"&gt;They’re basically the same thing. UAP stands for unidentified aerial phenomena, which is a new fancy way of saying unidentified flying objects. Naming a Pentagon program after UFOs would be far too silly for a big, very serious government intelligence program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7bg1E"&gt;More seriously, putting “objects” in the name could be too limiting of a word for a program that deals with the unknown. Can we really consider them “objects” if we’re only seeing strange shapes through fuzzy camera footage from military aircraft? “Phenomena” would be a bit more accurate. It’s defined as “a fact or situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or explanation is in question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G8TULb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cwgFOk"&gt;Depends on how far back you want to go. The US has dabbled in UFO research for decades, and various documents have been made public over the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0j299"&gt;The Air Force had &lt;a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/military/air-force/ufos"&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, which closed in 1969 after investigating more than 12,500 UFO sightings. The CIA &lt;a href="https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/ufos-the-central-intelligence-agency-cia-collection/"&gt;dumped a trove&lt;/a&gt; of historical UFO records in January, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdqjy/you-can-now-easily-download-all-cia-ufo-documents-to-date"&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt; more government attempts to explain unidentified aerial phenomena in the years following Project Blue Book’s end. None of these historical records link any unexplained phenomena to extraterrestrial activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hqSxxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pentagon takes UAP “incursions... very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m9Tjnn"&gt;The government says it’s generally interested in UAPs / UFOs out of national security concerns. In one statement from August last year, the Defense Department said it takes “any incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace very seriously and examine each report. This includes examinations of incursions that are initially reported as UAP when the observer cannot immediately identify what he or she is observing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5l4Vw"&gt;Public fascination with UFOs generally &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-man-who-introduced-the-world-to-flying-saucers/372732/"&gt;dates back to 1947&lt;/a&gt;, when an amateur pilot flying his plane near Mount Rainier in Washington state reported sights of nine “saucer-like” objects darting across the sky. His recollection of what he saw spawned &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080413203646/http://www.mimufon.org/historical_folders/nicap_pages/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf"&gt;a wave of press attention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ckR4Fi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how did the most recent round of UFO... sorry — UAP — discourse start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HA6AJt"&gt;It started in 2017, when stories published by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/16/pentagon-ufo-search-harry-reid-216111/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a classified Pentagon project that began in 2007 to investigate unidentified phenomena and ended in 2012. Formally established under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and later transferred to the Defense Department’s headquarters, it was reportedly run primarily by former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo, who has said he resigned in 2017 over what he considered internal opposition to government-funded UAP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhmAh3"&gt;(It’s worth noting that both the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reports have been criticized as being credulous toward &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/ufo-unidentified-history-channel-luis-elizondo-pentagon/"&gt;Elizondo’s claims&lt;/a&gt; and overly accepting of the remote possibility that UAPs can be attributed to alien activity. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22463659/ufo-videos-navy-alien-drone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of laying out some of the surrounding context and is worth a read.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxFtKJ"&gt;AATIP also gathered studies on wild ideas straight out of science fiction, from nuclear propulsion to invisibility cloaking, warp drives, metallic glasses, programmable matter, etc., &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18187178/pentagon-research-documents-invisibility-cloaking-wormholes-warp-drive-department-of-defense"&gt;according to a list&lt;/a&gt; of AATIP research products that was sent to Congress in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo By Bill Clark / CQ Roll Call&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UYY26K"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reports, AATIP’s initial “black” budget of $22 million — a minuscule amount compared to other Pentagon budgets — was pushed by former Nevada senator and space phenomena enthusiast Harry Reid. Most of that funding reportedly went to a Las Vegas-based space company owned by hotel chain magnate and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22463659/ufo-videos-navy-alien-drone"&gt;campaign donor&lt;/a&gt; to and longtime friend of Reid. Bigelow told the&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;that his company, Bigelow Aerospace, modified storage buildings at its headquarters to make room for mysterious “metal alloys” that were recovered during work on the AATIP contract. Though the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; never attributed the alloys’ origins to aliens, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-those-alien-alloys-in-the-new-york-times-ufo-story/"&gt;the claim also received criticism&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing on these alloys has been revealed since. Bigelow hasn’t talked publicly about them since his interview with the&lt;em&gt; Times, &lt;/em&gt;and a Freedom of Information Act request filed to the DIA in early 2018 remains open with no records turned over (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jt9sQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwTIZf"&gt;While AATIP is now defunct, it has a successor. In June 2020, the Senate Intelligence Committee &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgx573/senate-intelligence-committee-confirms-the-us-navy-has-a-ufo-task-force"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, situated within the Office of Naval Intelligence. The Pentagon &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2314065/establishment-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-task-force/"&gt;confirmed and announced&lt;/a&gt; the task force a few months later, describing in a statement the body’s mission “to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” Last December, the intelligence committee gave the Pentagon six months to produce a report detailing the task force’s findings on UAPs. That’s the one due on June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVWbdV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will the report include? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IMbhJT"&gt;It’s very unlikely the looming Pentagon report will tell us what the objects are, and it doesn’t sound like US intelligence officials know much about them. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/ufos-sighting-alien-spacecraft-pentagon.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; published on June 2nd says intelligence officials behind the report haven’t found any evidence attributing the phenomena to aliens, but they can’t rule it out either. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; also says intelligence officials swiftly ruled out any possibility of the objects being secret US aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGa4gu"&gt;The classified version of the report was delivered to Congress on June 2nd, per a person familiar with it. The unclassified version — still in the works, according to the DoD press officer — is expected to be a fairly straightforward assessment of what the Pentagon’s UAP task force knows about the phenomena and what it doesn’t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nd3ZEX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any videos of the UFOs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zjhw"&gt;Yep, there are four videos — three were declassified and released via the Freedom of Information Act by the Navy in 2020 after being leaked in 2007 and 2017, and one was leaked and later authenticated by the Defense Department in 2019. The videos show four separate incidents. Reid, the former senator and UAP hawk, said disclosure of the three videos “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorReid/status/1254836730546384897?s=20"&gt;only scratches the surface&lt;/a&gt; of research and materials available” to the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2UnIVS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Pentagon UFO videos: FLIR, GIMBAL, and GOFAST|102729" data-volume-uuid="4089203ee" data-volume-id="102729" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-128" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k6E6AJ"&gt;The three declassified black-and-white videos, titled FLIR, GOFAST, and GIMBAL, are the most tantalizing. Captured by instrument cameras aboard Navy fighter aircraft in 2004, 2014, and 2015, they appear to show tiny, pill-shaped objects whizzing through the air. One of them appears to rotate midflight. Two videos show the objects speeding over ocean waters, coming with commentary from the pilots: “Look at that thing, dude!” one pilot yells. “It’s rotating,” says another. “There’s a whole fleet of them... They’re all going against the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NMCv05"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could the UFOs be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BIhWE9"&gt;We don’t know yet. There are five main theories on what the UAPs are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c1OHHH"&gt;Something extremely benign like a drone or large bird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tZgSbc"&gt;Top-secret US technology that the Navy and other agencies don’t know about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifQ5qn"&gt;Foreign technology from US adversaries like Russia or China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qI5Uha"&gt;Some kind of illusion, like a camera defect or &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/06/world/europe/flying-ship-cornwall.html"&gt;mirage&lt;/a&gt;, which are optical illusions caused by atmospheric conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KkOja2"&gt;Aliens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EgET50"&gt;Intelligence officials ruled out the possibility that the UAPs were glimpses of secret US technology in action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;report. And it’s worth noting that the UAPs can be any number of those five theories (with aliens being the most controversial and polarizing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0OmoQP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It might simply be a distant plane”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OoxoTn"&gt;Mick West, a pseudoscience debunker, told CNN that characteristics of the Naval aircraft videos make the objects appear more interesting than they should be. “It never really does anything interesting, and it might simply be a distant plane,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MickWest/status/1396136405349269511"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r119JWI04Ls&amp;amp;ab_channel=MickWest"&gt;In a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, West rebutted the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ use of the term “Glowing Auras” in the headline of its 2017 story to describe UAPs recorded on thermal video cameras, which sometimes makes objects look like they’re glowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3ya1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All options have to be on the table.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBsgwe"&gt;Elizondo, the very vocal former AATIP director, would beg to differ with West’s assessment. He hasn’t claimed UAPs represent alien technology, but his colorful descriptions to the press continue to hype up that prospect: “We’re dealing with a technology that could be 50-1,000 years ahead of us,” he &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2021/06/08/ufos-national-security-with-luis-elizondo-former-director-advanced-aerospace-threat-identification-program-aatip/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;in a live interview&lt;/a&gt; last week. “At the end of the day, we don’t know what we’re dealing with. All options have to be on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wEdCA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Blink-182 involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8VPUnK"&gt;Not exactly. But Blink-182’s former lead singer, Tom DeLonge, is. DeLonge is obsessed with UFOs. Don’t even get him started on UFOs, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUCtu_fq18&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrSnrub"&gt;he warns in this undated interview on UFOs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOy9Ab"&gt;DeLonge is so obsessed with unidentified phenomena that he left his punk-rock band bank in 2015 to start an organization in 2017 called To the Stars Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences (TTSA), a research and media company based in Las Vegas — yes, the same city as Bigelow’s space company. TTSA is relevant because it’s where Elizondo and Chris Mellon, former Democratic staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, wound up after leaving their government posts. The company pushed for and promoted the release of the three Navy videos and actually worked with Bigelow and various government agencies to investigate UAP. The organization signed an agreement with the US Army in 2019 to study “exotic metals” recovered under the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fl6Rrz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“TTSA has decided to restructure its operations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxiESw"&gt;But TTSA ran into problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Elizondo and Mellon left the company earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1710274/000149315221004131/form1-u.htm"&gt;according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing&lt;/a&gt; from February. “TTSA has decided to restructure its operations to scale back its initiatives in science and tech commercialization and to place a greater emphasis on the operations of its entertainment business,” the filing said. It’s unclear what came of the Army agreement after TTSA’s shift away from UAP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4zhXHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But come on... it’s aliens, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mP2VPR"&gt;Probably not. The slow drip of news from the Pentagon on UAPs has allowed a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/pentagon-s-ufo-footage-obama-s-curiosity-ratchet-expectations-big-ncna1268222"&gt;alien hype&lt;/a&gt; to fester. Does that mean aliens don’t exist anywhere in the universe? No. There are multiple ongoing projects to look for alien life, or signs of past alien life, well beyond UFOs. To name a few: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; on Mars, a &lt;a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/news/cfa-scientists-collaborate-new-study-search-universe-signs-technological-civilizations"&gt;joint academic hunt for technosignatures&lt;/a&gt; coming from distant corners of the universe, or any of the hundreds of research programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22545453/alien-planets-view-earth-astronomers-journal-nature"&gt;examining exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dQEeLN"&gt;While an outcome involving aliens might be fun, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/astronaut-chris-hadfield-calls-alien-ufo-hype-foolishness/"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/opinion/ufo-sightings-report.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/a-word-about-those-ufo-videos/"&gt;not going to happen&lt;/a&gt; in today’s UAP saga.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are two podcasts from our Windows 11 coverage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tY3Pw3BFITeX-bNZjmse_0d9hRo=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504359/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnoEEN"&gt;On Thursday, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates"&gt;official reveal of Windows 11 at Microsoft’s event&lt;/a&gt;, which showed off a redesign of the Microsoft operating system — including a replaced Start menu, updated app store, and lots more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvOUrq"&gt;This week on&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;dedicate a majority of the show to talk about &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/microsoft"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren discuss the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548950/microsoft-windows-11-skype-onenote-live-tiles-cortana"&gt;biggest changes from Windows 10 to 11&lt;/a&gt;, the complications of bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps to Windows with Amazon’s app store&lt;/a&gt;, and how Microsoft’s stance on being an open platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549007/microsoft-windows-11-satya-nadella-remarks-apple"&gt;has evolved among the other tech giants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jb4s6f"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9322407846&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RARQ6f"&gt;We also have a sort of companion piece to this week’s show: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22549385/microsoft-satya-nadella-interview-windows-11-decoder"&gt;Nilay spoke with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella&lt;/a&gt; on our other podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/decoder"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder with Nilay Patel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to chat about Windows as a platform, what Microsoft’s responsibilities are, and how he thinks the various antitrust bills in Congress will affect Microsoft’s plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ccx5uN"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3710346080&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bisrWQ"&gt;I would suggest listening to the interview with Satya Nadella first, as Nilay makes a few references to the interview in the &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; episode. Both episodes together cover everything you need to know about the new update of Windows announced this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon acquires encrypted messaging app Wickr</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VN-TzdSqLMdRsg91tiRP7eyPM10=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504312/1232270762.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Halstead/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bfl2Dv"&gt;Wickr, the encrypted messaging app founded in 2012, has been purchased by Amazon, the company &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-welcomes-wickr-to-the-team/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvoPHE"&gt;“We’re excited to share that AWS has acquired Wickr, an innovative company that has developed the industry’s most secure, end-to-end encrypted, communication technology,” Stephen Schmidt, Amazon Web Services’ vice president, wrote. With a nod to the company's ever-deepening relationships with the military, and Washington in general, Schmidt added that Wickr’s features give “security conscious enterprises and government agencies the ability to implement important governance and security controls to help them meet their compliance requirements.” Schmidt himself has a background in this space: his LinkedIn &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenschmidt1/"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; notes he spent a decade at the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvE2Zs"&gt;Wickr’s app — like secure messaging competitor Signal — has been popular with journalists and whistleblowers; it's also been a go-to for criminals, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnapp/amazon-acquires-encrypted-messaging-app-wickr"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear if the proximity to the tech monolith will impact the app’s popularity for free users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygW8SR"&gt;In Amazon’s case, Schmidt indicates the acquisition was at least partially influenced by the need to preserve information security while working remotely. “With the move to hybrid work environments, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, enterprises and government agencies have a growing desire to protect their communications,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54vlBU"&gt;Schmidt says AWS will be offering Wickr services effective immediately. Current Wickr users shouldn’t see significant changes for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s new virtual concert might be its trippiest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZtrQr6-_2scW0MEcxi4Y9V_1o4=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504241/Fortnite_20210625085348.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mRwckH"&gt;Ever since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello first took the virtual stage in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, developer Epic Games has experimented with different ways to bring music into the game. That could mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;a gigantic Travis Scott stomping around the battle royale island&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;building a separate space dedicated explicitly to live performances&lt;/a&gt;. This week’s musical experience featuring English band Easy Life is yet another new technique: a strange world built in&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s creative mode. It might be the trippiest virtual concert yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="neQ73F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s experimental story is an attempt to create ‘the entertainment experience of the future’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"},{"title":"Fortnite is launching a concert series it hopes will become a ‘tour stop’ for artists","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pFYuGF"&gt;It starts out normal enough. Players are ushered into a virtual re-creation of The O2 Arena in London, where the band welcomes you via gigantic screen. From there, things get progressively weirder. First, you’re pushed into a room that slowly fills with water before you’re flushed down a gigantic toilet into a surreal desert filled with massive tube TVs. It’s a bit like a pop art take on Salvador Dalí. Subsequent locations are just as odd: you’ll dance inside the corpse of a huge monster, ride a hoverboard across a twisted city straight out of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;, and then float amid the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cb9t9UjBTCSjPJJ0p094Mgp0Kes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681124/Fortnite_20210625084911.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzgEEhpfSXlI8EmMEcoAvulSROo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681089/Fortnite_20210625090538.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yWqM5fMjZpV8RWcBuCcPXmeJi80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22681210/Fortnite_20210625085727.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="innItU"&gt;Each area is also outfitted with lots and lots of screens where you can watch the band. There are TVs floating in the sky and even some wedged between the ribs of the deceased monster. It’s kind of like watching a series of music videos while hanging out in a bunch of weird virtual spaces. You can dance, run, and jump, but there are no guns or ways to mess with other players. The videos also match the theme of the locations: when you’re in the desert, for instance, all of the band are buried to their necks in sand. At the end, a sense of normalcy resumes, with players transported to a luxury box back at the arena, like you’re waking up from a dream. The whole thing lasts about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrD6ld"&gt;The Easy Life event, which runs until 7PM ET on June 27th, presents an interesting middle ground for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concerts. The Travis Scott and Marshmello shows were impressive but were also huge undertakings; the entire battle royale game comes to a halt in order to accommodate them. (That’s likely the reason there have only been two since 2019.) Meanwhile, concerts in party royale — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242668/fortnite-party-royale-social-space-metaverse-travis-scott"&gt;a violence-free social space that debuted in 2020&lt;/a&gt; — are relatively simple, as players can gather together to watch a performance on a big screen. Easy Life’s show, meanwhile, has the best of both worlds. It was built in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-like creative mode, so it exists in its own space distinct from the main game, but it’s also much stranger and more interactive than the party royale events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWgAFI"&gt;Music is clearly a big part of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s plans as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;it continues to shift into something much more ambitious than a multiplayer shooter&lt;/a&gt;. “Our lofty goal is to create the entertainment experience of the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;Epic’s chief creative officer Donald Mustard told me in March&lt;/a&gt;. And utilizing the creative seems like a good way to make these experiences both more interesting and more regular. At the very least, it’s a chance to listen to an up-and-coming band while riding a hoverboard across some skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;
