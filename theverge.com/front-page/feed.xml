    <title>Elon Musk says he has moved to Texas, calls California overly ‘complacent’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NQF62M4oeWZUX7WovCbocb1WYfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479979/elon_musk_tesla_3036.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXe4wi"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has joined &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/06/about-a-fifth-of-u-s-adults-moved-due-to-covid-19-or-know-someone-who-did/"&gt;one-fifth of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who have done a “pandemic move.” After spending most of his life in Silicon Valley, Musk has relocated to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RK8eqm"&gt;The Tesla CEO let that news slip during an interview for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s annual CEO Council summit. He cited the construction of a new Tesla factory outside Austin, as well as Space X’s planned launch site near the South Texas village of Boca Chica, as a factor in his move. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155743/elon-musk-moving-texas-tesla-spacex-california"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that Musk was considering relocating to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyPJjw"&gt;He also criticized California’s economic environment as another reason. “If a team is winning for too long, they tend to get complacent,” Musk said. “California has been winning for a long time, and I think they’re taking it for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bbe9yI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a team is winning for too long, they tend to get complacent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gT0ruP"&gt;Musk argued that Silicon Valley, home to some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, was declining in relevance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRq3MN"&gt;It seems that leaving California has been on Musk’s mind for a while now. On May 1st, he tweeted, “I will own no home.” Later, it was reported that he &lt;a href="https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/elon-musk-strikes-deal-to-sell-multiple-homes-in-los-angeles-217252"&gt;sold all four of his homes&lt;/a&gt; in California for a combined $62.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KGzxj"&gt;It’s not just about being closer to his companies’ various projects in Texas. Musk also stands to save a lot of money on income taxes by moving to the Lone Star State. The billionaire CEO is slated to earn more than $50 billion in stock options, and he would have to pay income taxes on the profits when he exercises them if he remained in California. Texas, however, has &lt;a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.8.htm"&gt;no personal income tax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIe2BP"&gt;Musk recently surpassed Bill Gates as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612410/elon-musk-overtakes-bill-gates-to-become-worlds-second-richest-person-behind-jeff-bezos"&gt;second richest man in the world&lt;/a&gt;. His net worth now sits at around $128 billion, after increasing by $100 billion this year. He gained another $10 billion on December 8th, as Tesla’s stock shot up with the news that the company planned to do its second &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-equity/tesla-launches-second-5-billion-share-sale-in-three-months-idINKBN28I1FP"&gt;$5 billion capital raise&lt;/a&gt; in the past three months. He is now about $80 billion shy of catching up to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Minecraft with RTX ray tracing launches for Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ab670Qz6IRmCG_HhFaUCkov2Mb4=/67x0:784x478/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479927/minecraft_with_rtx_out_now_dungeon_dash_rtx_001_on_850px.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.blockworks.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlockWorks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8a9IRn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;’s blocky aesthetic was massively spruced up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219882/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-beta-nvidia-windows-release-date"&gt;the introduction of ray tracing&lt;/a&gt; enabled by Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards earlier this year. And now, that feature is coming out of beta, and path-traced ray tracing is available to all Windows 10 &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; players with the GPUs that support it, Nvidia &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fminecraft-rtx-dlss-official-release%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163539%2Fminecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-windows-released#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced in a blog post on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzIIyX"&gt;If you missed the beta or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542264/xbox-series-x-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion-4k-video-gameplay"&gt;other examples in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, ray tracing allows for realistic, physics-based lighting in games. &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; traditionally shirks realism in favor of a pixel art, sandbox fantasy aesthetic, but the pairing works well here. The changes to lighting are most immediately notable in reflections in water, shadows that respond dynamically to light sources, and different intensities of light. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxlGO1pSstBTAHVZ3VmdwIJchOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154911/minecraft_with_rtx_out_now_colosseum_rtx_001_on_850px.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/BanvP" target="_blank"&gt;Banv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhanced lighting and reflections in a custom Coliseum map.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JuNCMJ"&gt;Along with lighting, RTX ray tracing also allows for more detailed “physically-based rendering” (PBR) in texture packs, including the ability to set the relative reflectiveness of each object. &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; players on Windows 10 will have access to a special PBR version of the default texture pack for use while playing, or until their favorite creator releases their own updated pack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcH3AxWDUY_0xkMHsmQJF0fBziw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154917/hd_texture_pack_kb_850px.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples of physically based rendering textures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kbSFgb"&gt;Running the game with ray tracing seems like it could be a big hit to performance, but Nvidia says DLSS 2.0 support on RTX cards, which stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, should keep the game running at a high frame rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a03sIL"&gt;Using artificial intelligence to save time rendering high-resolution images, RTX 2060 owners can get around 60 frames per second playing at 1920 x 1080 resolution in Nvidia’s Quality Mode. Players with GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 cards should be able to get “well over” 60fps playing in 4K, Nvidia says. All of these benchmarks were set under Nvidia’s specific testing conditions which can be viewed on their blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMk6gb"&gt;You’ll need at least a GeForce RTX 2060 or better to run &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing, and relying on an older card might be your best bet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/10/29/21539965/nvidia-rtx-3070-preorders-sold-out-micro-center-best-buy-newegg"&gt;given how difficult it can be&lt;/a&gt; to get a newer 30 series one. Head to Nvidia’s blog for full instructions on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fminecraft-rtx-dlss-official-release%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163539%2Fminecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-windows-released#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to enable ray tracing in your game, download some custom maps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fguides%2Fminecraft-rtx-texturing-guide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163539%2Fminecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-windows-released#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;update your texture packs to support PBR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT review roundup: a niche purchase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKSsnX3hHcT0wHQSHUlly6x43hs=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479887/twarren_201116_4300_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hEJ6a7"&gt;AMD has released the newest member of its Radeon RX 6000 series: the Radeon RX 6900 XT. The card is based on the same Navi 21 silicon as the rest of the RX 6000 series so far and is being billed as the fastest Radeon card yet. According to reviews, it’s a step up from previous generations when it comes to performance, but not worth its $1,000 price tag for most consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVPUYb"&gt;Reviews agree that this card is a racehorse. “This is one blistering-fast GPU,” concludes Brad Chacos of &lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3600449/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review.html?page=8#toc-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCWorld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-big-navi-review?page=4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Marco Chiappetta dubbed it “the most powerful Radeon ever.” In &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s testing, the RX 6900 XT averaged 85fps across its 13-game testing suite at 4K resolution and ultra settings and 136.1fps at 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V8QlkCLKVmJpDOm2OxQSH-5Lr8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155016/02ASW514FGccA0uidWI5Z0n_1.1607382689.fit_lim.fit_lim.size_1344x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4E4LmD"&gt;Reviewers also largely agree that the Radeon RX 6900 XT is a better purchase than Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3090 for most gamers. The way hardware performs will always vary by game, but &lt;em&gt;PCWorld &lt;/em&gt;and Hilbert Hagedoorn of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_radeon_rx_6900_xt_review,33.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guru3D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that the 6900 XT and the RTX 3090 achieved comparable frame rates at lower resolutions, while Nvidia pulled ahead at higher resolutions. Due to the 6900 XT’s lower price, both publications recommend it as the better-value purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehkprf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Hardware&lt;/em&gt; hedges a bit more, noting that “the Radeon RX 6900 XT and the GeForce RTX 3090 are fairly nip and tuck, and trade victories depending on the title, though the RTX 3090 does have the overall edge.” While the review notes that AMD’s card is “well-positioned relative to competing offerings from Nvidia,” Chiappetta also concludes that it “doesn’t definitively beat competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npNWTd"&gt;But AMD’s card is at a significant disadvantage when it comes to ray tracing. Reviewers are split on how important this is. &lt;em&gt;Guru3D &lt;/em&gt;suggests not everyone cares about ray tracing, and as long as you don’t, AMD’s card is a better buy. Jarred Walton of &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; counters that people considering cards that are this expensive shouldn’t overlook ray tracing; Walton doesn’t recommend the card for general gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afCVn1"&gt;But reviews also agree that anyone who really cares about value might as well buy the 6800 XT instead — a more affordable card that &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;senior editor Tom Warren found quite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review#:~:text=The%20RX%206800%20XT%20is,fully%20for%20next%2Dgeneration%20games."&gt;capable of&lt;/a&gt; 4K and 1440p gaming. &lt;em&gt;PCWorld &lt;/em&gt;emphasizes that the 6900 XT is really intended for content creation professionals. And &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware &lt;/em&gt;laments that the 6900 XT is only “4 to 7 percent faster” than the 6800 XT — “such an incremental bump in performance that it hardly seems worth the trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xwgfxh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review: AMD is back in the game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review: entry-level 4K","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"},{"title":"The true price of a PS5, Xbox, Nvidia or AMD GPU this holiday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="385i2X"&gt;Overall, it seems like the 6900 XT is a fairly niche purchase for folks who are willing to drop $1,000 on a seriously powerful GPU but don’t mind a disadvantage when it comes to ray tracing. To be clear, though, this is all a theoretical discussion at this point: these cards are available in quite limited quantities, and the first batch of Radeon RX 6900 XT cards &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-6900-xt-graphics-cards-immediately-sell-out"&gt;sold out in minutes&lt;/a&gt; this morning. But hey, it’s good to keep in mind for the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Gaming had its best year ever with more than 100 billion hours watched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yl3EDdFNhXfvrLLblVrC95tKGn4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479751/acastro_180202_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3zNK1d"&gt;Gaming remains one of the most dominant pillars of online entertainment, and nowhere is that more apparent than in YouTube’s 2020 statistics. According to YouTube Gaming head Ryan Wyatt, users of the video-sharing site watched 100 billion hours of gaming content on the platform this past year, double the number of hours watched in 2018. The company also &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-gaming-2020/"&gt;published a blog post on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; with a more in-depth rundown of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ww2km5"&gt;Of that 100 billion figure, 10 billion of those hours were of YouTube Gaming live streams, a strong sign the Google-owned site is shaping up to be an even more formidable competitor to Amazon-owned Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pnuXOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You all watched an impressive 100 billion hours of Gaming video content on the platform, with over 10B of those hours coming from live gaming streams. If you remember, that's DOUBLED what we did in 2018 (50B+). Yes, Gaming on YouTube has doubled in size in just 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Wyatt (@Fwiz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fwiz/status/1336303257421901824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAcELl"&gt;Wyatt had some other interesting stats to share. For instance, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;was the most-watched game on all of YouTube by a large margin, with more than 200 billion views of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;live streams and uploaded video watched this year. Naturally, the next most-watched game on the platform was &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;with 75 billion views, and the top five are rounded out by mobile battle royale &lt;em&gt;Garena Free Fire &lt;/em&gt;(72 billion), &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; (70 billion), and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;(67 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5xUfB"&gt;YouTube says it now has more than 40 million active gaming channels, and that 80,000 channels hit 100,000 subscribers this past year. More than 1,000 channels broke 5 million subscribers in 2020, while more than 350 channels hit 10 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CtzFJ"&gt;“Creators across the board have seen massive increases in subscribers, audiences and viewership throughout 2020. One incredible example of growth in 2020 is &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; content creator Dream, who saw channel subscriptions surge from 1 million in January 2020 to over 13 million by October the same year,” reads YouTube’s blog post. “The channel’s speedrunning series drew in tens of millions of views each.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyFm7g"&gt;Part of the reason why gaming content has likely surged in 2020 is the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has sent online entertainment stats through the roof for activities like streaming TV and multiplayer gaming. We don’t yet have stats for Facebook Gaming or Twitch, but it would not be surprising for both those competitors to report record numbers before the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPML5E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that the most-watched games on YouTube were measured in hours viewed. That is incorrect; YouTube measures them by total number of views. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="u4M9mr"&gt;Huawei worked on a facial recognition system to monitor and track China’s Uighur minority, according to &lt;a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/huawei-megvii-uygur.html"&gt;a new report from video surveillance researchers at IPVM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NTqx8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/08/huawei-tested-ai-software-that-could-recognize-uighur-minorities-alert-police-report-says/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the report draws on &lt;a href="https://d1tzzns6d79su2.cloudfront.net/uploads/embedded_file/7a5c7231788844c43cdabae1aaea8340a138bff47e5a69c60c48ea9b49f5381b/8ece7111-f067-4545-ab0c-49146d51391e.pdf"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; posted publicly to Huawei’s website, obtained via Google search. The facial recognition project appears to have been a demonstration of how Huawei hardware could be used to employ partner algorithms from a Chinese vendor called Megvii. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2DtEW"&gt;IPVM’s report particularly highlights the “Uighur Alert” feature, which would use facial recognition to identify a subject’s ethnicity and generate an alert if the subject belonged to China’s Uighur minority group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiRaeW"&gt;A Muslim minority group from northwestern China, Uighurs are subject to intense political repression by the Chinese government, making efforts to identify and track them particularly dangerous. Since 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/features/uighurs/"&gt;at least 1 million Uighurs&lt;/a&gt; have been relocated to a network of detention camps in the Xinjiang province, where they are &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/28/21333345/uighurs-china-internment-camps-forced-labor-xinjiang"&gt;forced to submit to indoctrination programs&lt;/a&gt;. China has historically denied the existence of the camps, although &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/satellite-images-investigation-xinjiang-detention-camps"&gt;satellite imagery confirms their existence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuBa6t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; report in 2019&lt;/a&gt; identified a number of Chinese facial recognition companies building algorithms to identify Uighurs, some of which have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903660/us-blacklist-china-surveillance-companies"&gt;faced US sanctions&lt;/a&gt; in the months since the report. But while Megvii had previously been linked to Uighur recognition systems, this is the first indication that Huawei may be actively developing and promoting such a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYL35m"&gt;Huawei did not respond for a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first to support HomeKit Secure Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37zrbrLX1IEHZRskLwbQfrO7-fc=/189x0:2292x1402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479647/Screen_Shot_2020_12_08_at_1.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgILyD"&gt;Logitech has quietly revealed a new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHPGS2VC%2FA%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Circle View Wired Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; camera today, which is notably the first consumer smart doorbell to support Apple’s recent HomeKit Secure Video standard. The new doorbell is available from both Apple and Logitech’s websites for $199.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68qgFf"&gt;Apple first debuted the HomeKit Secure Video standard in 2019, but it’s taken some time for developers to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fhome%2Faccessories%2F%23section-camera&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163585%2Flogitech-circle-view-wired-doorbell-homekit-secure-video#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adopt the system&lt;/a&gt;. Logitech’s new Circle View Wired Doorbell is the first doorbell camera to offer it, at least on a consumer level (technically, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; notes, the Robin ProLine camera beat Logitech to the punch, although that product is designed for commercial customers rather than home installations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmT0TT"&gt;As for the camera itself, it’s design to exclusively work with Apple’s HomeKit system (so no Alexa or Google Nest support). The Circle View Wired Doorbell offers a 160-degree DFOV from a 5-megapixel sensor that shoots 1200 x 1600 video in HDR. There’s also an integrated light strip for nighttime that can light up to show visitors up to six feet away, along with color night vision. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mvdHmgY56ZZ41DoXrj0u2vDRywc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154964/HPGS2_AV4.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5a5ClF"&gt;HomeKit Secure Video allows for Logitech to outsource most of the actual “security camera” side of things to Apple’s software, using the Apple Home app to notify users when visitors are outside. It also uses Apple’s iCloud service for streaming, storing, and sharing video recordings, and Apple TV or HomePod devices function as main processing hubs for determining when people or vehicles are outside and for running &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/face-recognition-iph04af43727/ios"&gt;Apple’s face recognition feature&lt;/a&gt; (based on your photo library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rF8jmU"&gt;The Circle View Wired Doorbell camera is available for $199.99 (with Logitech also offering a $299.99 bundle that includes home installation through its website). To take full advantage of the HomeKit functionality, though, customers will also need a HomePod mini, HomePod, iPad, or Apple TV to serve as a HomeKit hub, as well as an iCloud storage plan for saving videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s official Galaxy S21, 21 Plus, and 21 Ultra teasers have leaked, and the camera squircle is gone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWgBsxXaSoexGgtZQSEKbS3EUpA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479492/samsung_galaxy_s21_plus_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91arj8"&gt;Samsung’s next flagship phones the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra are widely expected to arrive this January (alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22054757/galaxy-buds-pro-leaked-images-renders-rounded-design-case"&gt;some new buds&lt;/a&gt;), but we haven’t had a true glimpse at them yet. That may be changing today, as &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/"&gt;has just published&lt;/a&gt; three brief teaser videos that it says come directly from Samsung, and line up perfectly with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/18/21521860/samsung-galaxy-phones-january-2021-renders-leak"&gt;the OnLeaks renders&lt;/a&gt; we first saw in October.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4zp2zRZ7UOWkc2_K4LUD2HHGqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154918/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9q3nOGRCjCWFQpSKgj8Kc269jA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154919/samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_668_leak.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="re4oz4"&gt;While we can’t glean too much from these videos, they make it crystal clear what to expect from the design of these phones — a sleek, streamlined new camera bump that blends into the sides of the phone, with three cameras on the S21 and S21 Plus and five cameras (including what appears to be a periscope zoom lens, see the square shape) on the S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ha0Ubd"&gt;Your eagle eyes can probably also see that the S21 Ultra will have a curved screen, instead of the flat panels on the S21 and S21 Plus, and the names of all three phones include “5G” so there’ll hopefully be zero confusion about which networks they support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta5PM8"&gt;Otherwise, we have to consult previous leaks to see what these phones might be all about. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;claimed in November&lt;/a&gt; that we’d be looking at 6.2-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.8-inch phones, respectively — each with 120Hz screens; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; or Exynos 2100 processors; and 4,000mAh, 4,800mAh, and 5,000mAh batteries, respectively. However, the S21 Ultra will supposedly come with the brightest screen on a Samsung phone yet at 1,600 nits. It’ll also reportedly have an adaptive refresh rate that goes all the way down to 1Hz, as well as S Pen stylus support (but no integrated slot), while the standard S21 may have a plastic back instead of glass this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVI6d"&gt;The Ultra will also purportedly have an improved 108MP camera sensor and two telephoto lenses, one at 3x optical and one at 10x optical, each with larger pixels to gather more light than previous zooms. But its main camera and ultrawide camera are suspected to use the same 12MP sensors across the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aox2aB"&gt;According to filings at Brazil’s regulatory agency, the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s21_family_wont_have_a_charger_or_earphones_in_the_box-news-46634.php"&gt;may also ship without a charger or earbuds in the box&lt;/a&gt; — which would be pretty rich, considering how &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-apple-charger-box-1169323/"&gt;it made fun of Apple for doing the same&lt;/a&gt; only a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Gaming starts Black creator program with guaranteed monthly pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W23fMFUzloV0m1_auynY4LbgSgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68479048/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NR1ZUi"&gt;Today, Facebook Gaming announces a new initiative targeted specifically at Black streamers on the platform: the Black Gaming Creator Program. The company says it plans to invest $5 million a year over the next two years to support the Black gaming creator community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6GxYQ"&gt;If you’re selected to take part in the program, there are some benefits. You’ll get Facebook Gaming partnership, early product access (along with product feedback sessions), community support — which includes invitations to all digital and in person events — and mentorship. The program also comes with guaranteed monthly pay, which distinguishes it from other creator mentorship programs. Interested creators can apply &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/fbgaminghome/creators/black-gaming-creators-program"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUijmS"&gt;Leo Olebe, the global director of games partnerships at Facebook, said in a statement that the new initiative was part of Facebook’s $200 million commitment to support Black-owned businesses and organizations, which the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/supporting-black-and-diverse-communities/"&gt;announced this summer&lt;/a&gt;. “Game streaming brings people together in a powerful way over a shared passion for games, and we hope to encourage more people to express their creativity through gaming,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxFXZU"&gt;It’s an interesting move from Facebook, not least because it’s rare that a company puts money where it says its values are. On the other hand: Facebook did not say how many creators would be admitted into the program. The company did, however, clarify that monthly pay would vary based on “the quality of their content and the scale of their audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGL1G6"&gt;Nevertheless, it’s an example that other players in the live-streaming industry would do well to follow — because Black creators need support on those other platforms, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie confirms Destiny 2 crossplay is coming in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XwyFeBaLNbCooPTiYmzYZgfdls0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68478687/media_stasis_3.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zkL9Wa"&gt;Bungie has confirmed &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; will be getting crossplay support at some point next year. While Bungie didn’t specify which platforms will support the feature, hopefully you’ll be able to dive into &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; with players across every platform on which the game is available. That includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PC, and Stadia. Earlier this year, it seemed as though a 2021 launch date for crossplay was &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-crossplay-is-on-bungies-roadmap-heres-wh/1100-6478183/"&gt;the goal&lt;/a&gt;, but Bungie was more definite about a launch next year in a &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49957"&gt;blog post published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLVExl"&gt;Bungie has slowly been making the game more platform-agnostic. The studio added cross-save support, which lets you bring your save from one platform to another, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793948/destiny-2-cross-save-bungie-date-august-21-release-shadowkeep"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. And alongside the next-gen update for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/49650"&gt;that’s out today&lt;/a&gt;, the game will support cross-generation play, meaning that PS5 players will still be able to play with people on PS4, for example. The next-gen update also allows the game to run at up to 60fps and 4K resolution on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, adds an FOV slider, and improves load times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRtxWi"&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;still doesn’t have&lt;/a&gt; full anti-cheat on PC. If Bungie doesn’t implement stricter anti-cheating measures before the launch of crossplay, console players may run into cheaters if they are able to play with people on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4bJnb3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s biggest PC games are fighting a new surge of cheaters and hackers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"},{"title":"Bungie is launching cross-save for Destiny 2 on August 21st","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20793948/destiny-2-cross-save-bungie-date-august-21-release-shadowkeep"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
