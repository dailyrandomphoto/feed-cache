    <title>Bloodhound’s 1,000 mph rocket car being sold for $11 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rWlzPUyAUXb_2FmuA1SruT0F7aU=/491x0:5795x3536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724921/BLOODHOUND_LSR_Charlie_Sperring__IMGL5805.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bloodhound LSR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IPOhpa"&gt;For sale: a rocket-powered car named Bloodhound built specifically to break the land speed record. Theoretical top speed of 1,000 miles per hour. Seats one. Price? A paltry $11 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6eobx"&gt;The tortured saga of the Bloodhound Land Speed Record project has reached a sadly predictable impasse: the current owner is done spending money trying to set a new record after saving the project from bankruptcy in 2018. It’s hard to blame him. The Bloodhound program has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9384963/bloodhound-ssc-supersonic-rocket-car-photos"&gt;been going for the better part of a decade at this point&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to break the 763 mile-per-hour record, let alone scratch at the group’s ultimate stated goal of 1,000 miles per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvZDUi"&gt;The Bloodhound still needs the actual rocket in order to make its full-speed runs, too, despite hitting 628 miles per hour in a late-2019 test. (It’s currently jet engine powered.) The pandemic killed the project’s momentum, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1hgKR"&gt;“Work now needs to restart in the next few months to get ready for a 2022 record attempt,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloodhoundlsr.com/800-mph-bloodhound-lsr-project-for-sale/"&gt;a blog post on the Bloodhound website reads&lt;/a&gt;. “The alternative would be to put the car into long-term storage, with no certainty of being able to restart the project. As the prospect of a post-Covid world beckons, the Bloodhound team now needs to find a new owner to continue its ‘engineering adventure’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtV9SW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$11 million is a lot of money, but it’s also not? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBgqzv"&gt;Don’t get me wrong — $11 million is a lot of money to most people. But in many parts of the economy right now, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-jerome-powell-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-db97a4aeb224f3f8e7fa85a9e0bd7fb1"&gt;money is nearly free&lt;/a&gt;. In the last half-year alone, for example, billions of dollars have been thrown at unproven automotive startups that have no chance of turning a profit anytime soon, thanks to the boom in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;mergers with special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;, or SPACs. Why not a rocket car? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu8S0r"&gt;Bloodhound argues buyers could recoup their investment as long as a record attempt happens. The Bloodhound team says there is “significant” fundraising potential “as the record attempt gets closer” and that selling sponsorships and rights could generate cash in the short term. Perhaps there’s a SPAC out there willing to test this claim &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-spac-bubble-may-burstand-not-a-day-too-soon-11609975529"&gt;before the inevitable SPAClash arrives&lt;/a&gt;? Or maybe &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/business/billionaire-wealth-inequality-poverty/index.html"&gt;the growing billionaire class would like to pitch in&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbbrCm"&gt;The gang behind the Bloodhound has a ways to go to beat the land speed record, but the project has been through so much that it’s hard to imagine things ending here. Scraping together another $11 million could be tricky, but it’s easier — and certainly less physically risky — than finding those last few hundred miles per hour. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Game Pass subscribers hit 18 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HmwHNtqDGSFMRSosE9FjBFqegiI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724877/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NdMGg0"&gt;Microsoft is continuing to attract people to its Xbox Game Pass service. The “Netflix for video games” service now has 18 million subscribers, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth"&gt;15 million previously reported&lt;/a&gt; in September. Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that offers access to a growing selection of more than 100 Xbox games for $9.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zf9Wte"&gt;Microsoft has been pushing Xbox Game Pass for more than a year now, and it’s clear the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;heavily invested in its future&lt;/a&gt;. Bungie’s &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; title appeared on Xbox Game Pass late last year, and &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;is also available on the service for both Xbox and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eg1sj4"&gt;On an earnings call today, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also revealed that Xbox Live has more than 100 million monthly active users. Nadella also said the launch of the Xbox Series X and S was the most successful in Microsoft’s history, with “the most devices ever sold in a launch month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61R5e"&gt;Microsoft also appears to be focused on studio acquisitions to bolster the content available on Game Pass. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/"&gt;ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt; acquisition, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; studio Bethesda Softworks, is a big deal that will boost Xbox Game Pass in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A3ZXIT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Game Pass briefly explained: console, PC, xCloud streaming and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"},{"title":"Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="v8PI9f"&gt;There have also been a variety of promotions designed to entice consumers into Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft regularly offers the first month of the service for $1 and has been incentivizing Xbox Live Gold customers to switch over to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the company’s new xCloud game streaming feature. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also now get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556384/xbox-game-pass-disney-plus-subscription-free-perk"&gt;a month of Disney Plus for free&lt;/a&gt;, alongside other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uwo263"&gt;Controversially, Microsoft recently planned to increase its Xbox Live Gold cost in a move that was widely interpreted as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244468/microsoft-xbox-live-price-increase"&gt;effort to push people into Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;quick to reverse its decision&lt;/a&gt;, and Xbox Live Gold prices will remain the same for now. Free-to-play games will also no longer require an Xbox Live Gold subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new iPhone update fixes security bugs, so it’s best to install it ASAP</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iMYjopuc0o5bZ3DZ5HzEUJPY_ZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724827/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmkq7k"&gt;Apple just released iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146"&gt;the update notes&lt;/a&gt; contain some worrying language (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Under kernel updates, Apple notes that “a malicious application may be able to elevate privileges,” and under WebKit updates, it says “a remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution.” After both statements, the update notes say, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCPp57"&gt;What this means, broadly, is that you should update your iOS devices as soon as possible. To put the language into plain terms: Apple found a security hole in its operating systems, and it also has evidence that someone may have exploited it. The update notes don’t have any further details, so for now, we don’t know who may have used the security breach or what they may have been using it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X02zGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not time for cyber-lockdown, but it is time to update&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXa7u"&gt;However it was used, the security breaches aren’t minor ones. An application being able to elevate privileges means that it could do things it’s not supposed to be able to do. Again, there aren’t any details, but broadly speaking, it means a malicious app could’ve bypassed some of Apple’s security protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RlwXb"&gt;The WebKit exploit isn’t better. A remote attacker being able to cause arbitrary code execution means an attacker could do things on your phone just from you visiting a website they control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nFOBQ"&gt;This isn’t to say it’s time to go into total cyber-lockdown mode, but it does mean that 14.4 isn’t an update you want to put off for a while. In the meantime, Apple says it’ll provide additional details soon, so we’ll keep an eye out for more information about the exploits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tweetbot 6 brings essential updates and a monthly subscription to the iPhone’s best Twitter app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqMbUIokFDhxVQu7cRbqDIasj7I=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724797/tweetbot.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiOYrW"&gt;Tweetbot has long been one of the best third-party Twitter applications around for the iPhone and Mac, and today sees the launch of the latest version for iOS: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834"&gt;Tweetbot 6&lt;/a&gt;, which converts the app into a paid subscription service instead of the single-time purchase that was previously offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7"&gt;The new app makes the change to &lt;a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access"&gt;Twitter’s new API&lt;/a&gt; that the company introduced last summer, enabling some long-missing features in the premium Twitter app like Twitter cards and polls. That change does come with some trade-offs, though, including the removal of user-selected options for URL shortening, image uploads, and video uploads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0OcxaY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter launches new API as it tries to make amends with third-party developers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21364644/twitter-api-v2-new-access-tiers-developer-portal-support-developers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Rb0hGa"&gt;The free version of the app offers some basic functionality in allowing users to view Twitter — but you’ll have to pay for more substantial features, including the ability to send or reply to tweets, along with support for multiple accounts, push notifications, and “advanced filtering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgwxoH"&gt;Existing users may find the update to be a bit frustrating, given that Tweetbot 5 had previously been a single-time purchase for $4.99. At $0.99 per month (or a discounted $5.99 per year), the new app marks a price increase no matter how you look at things, while offering only a handful of new features to make up the difference. Furthermore, Tapbots will soon stop selling Tweetbot 5 on the App Store (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992"&gt;developer Paul Haddad&lt;/a&gt; says Apple made that a requirement to approve the new version), so new users soon won’t have the choice to buy the outdated older version for a single-time payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbLEJq"&gt;Tapbots does note on its website that the new version of Tweetbot 6 is an “early access” version of the app, with “many new features on our roadmap to be built as well as new API’s to adopt as Twitter makes them available,” so it’s possible that the new app will get further functionality over time that may ease the bitter pill of the pricer subscription change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRmNnI"&gt;The company also has yet to announce any upgrade plans for the Mac version of Tweetbot, which currently uses the older Twitter API and still costs $9.99 upfront to use. Including an updated macOS version of Tweetbot in that monthly or yearly subscription could also help add value to the new subscription, a strategy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21109700/fantastical-flexibits-subscription-service-premium-price-apple"&gt;other apps like Fantastical&lt;/a&gt; have employed in their own jumps from paid apps to ongoing subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s VR painting app is getting the axe, but it will live on as an open-source project</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrKOLdCmEgIYFvgIAr7ku_9-XnU=/193x0:2563x1580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724785/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_1.41.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SPPTIk"&gt;Google is ending development on the virtual reality painting app Tilt Brush — one of the most well-known VR applications — and &lt;a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/01/the-future-of-tilt-brush.html"&gt;making it open source&lt;/a&gt;. Tilt Brush was &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/google-acquires-tilt-brush-developer-and-thrive-audio-to-add-to-vr-team/"&gt;acquired by Google in 2015&lt;/a&gt; after launching for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, and it was soon folded into the company’s larger VR plans, like its Google Cardboard and Daydream headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRLgrX"&gt;Tilt Brush’s main feature is three-dimensional painting in VR, but the app received interesting updates over its tenure at Google, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/30/13122502/tilt-brush-getting-multiplayer-mode-google-virtual-reality"&gt;multiplayer support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/20/14340346/google-open-source-tilt-brush-toolkit-unity-integration"&gt;an open-source toolkit&lt;/a&gt; that offered the ability to export Tilt Brush drawings for use in animation. With this latest announcement, that development is coming to an end, and future support of Tilt Brush is in the hands of the community that still uses it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRWpao"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TckqNdrdbgk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tWlMI2"&gt;Tilt Brush’s code can be accessed &lt;a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush"&gt;on GitHub now&lt;/a&gt;, but Google says some features had to be removed from the open-source release because of licensing restrictions. Should you want to try your hand at tinkering with open-source Tilt Brush, the company is &lt;a href="https://github.com/googlevr/tilt-brush/blob/master/README.md"&gt;providing detailed instructions&lt;/a&gt; on how to rebuild those missing features in the app. Additionally, Tilt Brush will still be available to download on all of the major VR app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPY2on"&gt;Tilt Brush is just the latest in a series of discontinued Google VR projects. Daydream VR headsets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915609/google-pixel-4-no-daydream-support-view-vr-headset-discontinued"&gt;were discontinued around the launch of the Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cardboard received a similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952495/google-cardboard-open-source-phone-based-vr-daydream"&gt;open-source send-off in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/google-jump-shutting-down-1203219306/"&gt;Jump camera and video service&lt;/a&gt; were 86’ed that same year, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564279/google-expeditions-vr-cardboard-tours-shutdown-arts-culture-app-migration"&gt;VR field trip software Expeditions&lt;/a&gt; rode off into the sunset in 2020. Its surviving projects include VR versions of YouTube and Google Earth, as well as game development studio Owlchemy Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAFI97"&gt;Google and Alphabet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;are no strangers to killing off former darlings&lt;/a&gt; and other people’s current ones. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243484/alphabet-google-shutting-down-loon-internet-balloon-company-x"&gt;Look no further than Loon&lt;/a&gt; for an odd and exciting project that was recently ended.) But shifting things to open source seems like a meaningful compromise for the people who still use these products every day. Without Google resources, whatever’s next for Tilt Brush will still be a ways off, but it’s nice that the graveyard was spared a new headstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mUhzQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon plans to almost double its mmWave 5G coverage this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S_z-943QoZMKipjS9DfyurWuSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724737/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JXMAO1"&gt;Verizon has big 5G plans for 2021 after formally launching its next-gen network in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509364/verizon-5g-network-ultra-wideband-nationwide-apple-event"&gt;October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, and close to the top of its list of priorities is expanding coverage of its ultra-fast mmWave coverage. That flavor of 5G is currently restricted to select areas within select cities in the US, and it’s highly dependent on your proximity to a Verizon 5G site due to the inherent technology that powers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAXx2l"&gt;Marketed under the name 5G Ultra Wideband (5G UW), this variety of 5G is the type with high speeds but poor coverage, meaning Verizon has its work cut out for it expanding network coverage in 2021. But in its earnings report on Tuesday, the company says it plans to nearly double its 5G UW network this year by adding more than 14,000 new “sites.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dTwSLpH9BVUiqBPrnScnMu687I8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261470/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_4.27.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="baqSU8"&gt;Now, it’s kind of ambiguous what a “site” means. Adding a 5G UW site sounds, in theory, like a way to expand the coverage area of the service, or at the very least to improve the connection strength in an existing area of coverage, considering mmWave tech relies on rigging up networks of antennas, power supplies, and other equipment to help boost range and blanket areas that are, right now, only served by slower and farther-reaching standard LTE and low-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjuCUF"&gt;Some of that equipment is apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249058/5g-cellular-equipment-houston"&gt;already showing up unannounced on the lawns of Houston residents&lt;/a&gt; who don’t really have a say in whether their slice of county-owned yard has to play host to these “ground fixtures” the size of chest cooler. Yet, it’s not clear if Verizon plans to add test sites primarily to improve the range and consistency of the network in existing markets, to bring coverage to new ones entirely, or a mix of both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZAxTn"&gt;That said, Verizon is, in effect, claiming it will double its coverage area to 30,000 sites by the end of the year. The company also says it plans to add 20 cities to its 5G UW coverage list, as well as 20-plus cities for its in-home 5G internet service. Presumably, that will be done through the site expansion to some degree. As of &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/verizon-hits-60-city-goal-with-4-new-super-fast-5g-cities#:~:text=Verizon%20today%20hit%20the%2060,%22%20millimeter%2Dwave%205G%20network."&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, Verizon surpassed its 60-city milestone for its 5G UW network, and earlier this week, it announced that prepaid customers can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248705/verizon-prepaid-5g-uw"&gt;begin accessing its 5G UW network&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are Intel’s first Iris Xe desktop GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pXkqlc0OvDk0g7hBZCuu9w90gg=/77x0:902x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724657/dg1_3d_rwd.png.rendition.intel.web.978.550.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus’ first Intel Iris Xe graphics card.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y1Kkof"&gt;Intel is launching its first Iris Xe desktop graphics cards today. Originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058422/intel-dg1-discrete-gpu-graphics-card-announcement-ces-2020"&gt;codenamed “DG1,”&lt;/a&gt; these new desktop GPUs are primarily aimed at small- and medium-sized businesses and mainstream desktop PCs. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/articles/intel-releases-iris-xe-desktop-graphics-cards/"&gt;Intel is teaming up&lt;/a&gt; with Asus and other partners to sell these cards to system integrators who will bundle them with prebuilt systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zewGOa"&gt;Much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21542700/intel-iris-ex-max-discrete-graphics-gpu"&gt;Iris Xe Max graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; that debuted in laptops back in October, these desktop GPUs aren’t really designed for gaming. Intel is marketing them as a way to improve what’s offered on mainstream desktop PCs, with better graphics, multi-display support, and improved hardware acceleration for certain codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lr3mQOR1-xOcQ4iMeNO71iZld4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22261498/colorful_2_fan_dg1_angle_1_rwd.png.rendition.intel.web.978.550.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel is working with other partners on these cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wOA5Qu"&gt;The cards will include three 4K display outputs for multiple monitors, alongside HDR support and AI capabilities. They will also support decoding AV1 content and ship with 4GB of video memory and 80 execution units. Intel is even offering Adaptive Sync support, so you’ll get a much smoother experience with higher refresh rate monitors with these cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhKvMM"&gt;While these initial cards aren’t designed to compete with Nvidia and AMD’s latest and greatest for gaming, Intel is also working on its Xe-HPG architecture. This promises to be focused on high-performance gaming tasks, and it could usher in an era of Intel competing with both AMD and Nvidia later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAS2df"&gt;The Iris Xe isn’t Intel’s first attempt at a desktop GPU, either. Intel killed off its Larrabee project &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel/intel-scraps-graphics-chip-based-on-larrabee-idUSTRE5B51QR20091206?type=technologyNews"&gt;10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it also launched its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel740"&gt;Intel i740 series&lt;/a&gt; all the way back in 1998. This is the first time in 20 years we’ve seen Intel launch a desktop GPU, but you’ll need to wait a little longer yet to see if Intel can truly take on Nvidia and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is making buying a gaming laptop more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VwG5Ha-sMcpxAh_qKNgGvSWeGNM=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68724548/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ie3joe"&gt;Gaming laptops that have Nvidia’s powerful RTX 30-series graphics chips inside are now shipping. I have a first look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI’s 2021 GS66 Stealth with the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, and my colleague Monica Chin published two reviews for launch day: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Flow X13&lt;/a&gt; (with its detachable RTX 3080 eGPU) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008450"&gt;MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; with the RTX 3070.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7V70cv"&gt;We discovered something strange: an RTX 3070 can now be faster than an RTX 3080 in some cases. We saw this first-hand in a few benchmark runs, where the RTX 3070 in the GP77 Leopard slightly surpassed the RTX 3080 in the GS66 Stealth. It wasn’t a blowout, just a few odd frames per second more in the benchmarks built into games like &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. But this shouldn’t be happening, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17htY1"&gt;This sounds like a huge controversy, but the explanation is nothing new. It’s just become something shadier than it ever needed to be. Nvidia is no longer adding “Max-Q” labels to the weaker, more power-efficient variants of its laptop-grade GPUs, and so you can no longer easily tell if you’re getting a full-fat GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoQo2n"&gt;The RTX 3080 in the GS66 Stealth is actually a Max-Q variant with a boost clock of 1,245MHz and a maximum wattage of 95 watts, which is about as weak as an RTX 3080 can get, according to Nvidia’s spec sheets. But customers probably wouldn’t know this by looking at this laptop’s box, MSI’s site, or the numerous retailer sites selling this model. The GP66 Leopard, on the other hand, is using an RTX 3070 that has a higher clock speed and more wattage than the norm, which explains why it was able to pull ahead a few times during our testing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX laptops" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7bY5R4IZGgiPi2jLRWNzVa8gRA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260491/nvidia_ampere_mobile_gpus_tdp.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s breakdown of the range in performance of each RTX 30-series graphics chip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J5JwKN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-RTX-30-Ampere-Mobile-will-no-longer-offer-Max-Q-or-Max-P-branding-OEMs-free-to-decide-TGP-and-Max-Q-features-to-implement.515922.0.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;NotebookCheck &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a wide array of wattages each RTX 30-series laptop chip can be set to — but it depends on what kind of laptop the manufacturer wants to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4XR3D"&gt;Thinner, lighter gaming laptops tend to use dialed-back Max-Q versions of Nvidia’s graphics chips for better efficiency (indicated as GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q in the past, for instance), while others use ones that don’t have the Max-Q branding and thus can be trusted to deliver better performance that’s more akin to the desktop versions of the GPU. Now, Nvidia is letting manufacturers hide which one they’re using in a laptop. It lets companies treat Nvidia’s mobile graphics cards on a spec sheet as if they all have consistent performance across all devices, but that’s far from being true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BBJcXG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Max-Q now apparently stands for “Maximum Questions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMHIKo"&gt;This lack of transparency is the key difference between how these RTX 30-series graphics chips are being marketed versus previous generations that utilized Max-Q chips, and it may lead to a lot of confused people. Nvidia also doesn’t require manufacturers that use Max-Q graphics chips to have Max-Q stickers on the laptop, which it has done previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej1x41"&gt;Naturally, MSI isn’t the only company already taking advantage of this. The Asus TUF Dash 15 and Gigabyte Aorus 15G that I’m testing each claim to have the RTX 3070, but each omits the crucial info that you’re getting the Max-Q variant of the chip. Like MSI’s laptop, you won’t find a detailed breakdown of the GPU’s boost clock speed or wattage requirements on either box or on retail listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Jrrf4"&gt;That’s crucial info to communicate to people, as they all but confirm whether you’re getting a slower Max-Q variant or a faster standard part.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cqn-R7Wsf8zDSpPvZ-jgSgCLAZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251174/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VCvXgs"&gt;Why would Nvidia make this change, knowing most average consumers will fall for it? When I asked, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it “strongly encourage[s] OEMs to list clocks and other technologies a laptop supports, including Advanced Optimus, Dynamic Boost 2, and more.” Judging by manufacturer websites so far, that “encouragement” doesn’t seem to be working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8JxZh"&gt;Nvidia also says the Nvidia Control Panel app, which is accessible &lt;em&gt;only after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve paid for and set up one of these laptops, now provides more spec info than before. Not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhtE8H"&gt;When I pressed Nvidia on whether it’d work to make these details more transparent to customers when they’re researching which laptop to buy, a spokesperson said the company is “reviewing additional ways to give consumers more insight prior to purchase.” It seems like a simple way of going about this would be to keep a running list of each model with detailed specs, like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fproducts%2Fg-sync-monitors%2Fspecs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22243065%2Fnvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia does with G-Sync-compatible monitors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sWwCY"&gt;There’s always a degree of uncertainty as to how each laptop is going to perform in the real world. The Max-Q branding, at the very least, helped customers see right away that they were getting a machine with a graphics chip that had a lower clock speed, thus resulting in slightly dialed-back performance than you’d get from the full-fat chip. Now, you’ll either have to read comparison reviews or hope that Nvidia reverses its policy that lets  manufacturers keep people in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PpftU"&gt;We’ll update this post if and when Nvidia shares its plans to improve transparency for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0ITXz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon says that it has resolved issues with Fios, its fiber-optic network, that affected many locations in the Northeastern US for hours on Tuesday. The company says things should be returning to normal, but a fiber cut in Brooklyn may mean that some might still be without service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiIa1L"&gt;Users began reporting problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; shortly after 11AM ET, and the volume of reports peaked at more than 22,000 on Tuesday. Hotspots for problems on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; included Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers experienced outages as well, though one in Brooklyn still doesn’t have service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2fRI9"&gt;“An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved,” Verizon said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776"&gt;via its support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to many users on the platform. “Network performance and service levels are returning to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good afternoon and happy new year Darren, Thanks so much for reaching out to us. An internet issue impacting the quality of our Fios service throughout the Northeast has been resolved. Network performance and service levels are returning to normal. Please DM us if not back.  ^RME&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354171858720075776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;The account also said at 11:52AM ET that there was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;a fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, and as of 4:04PM ET on Tuesday, the company said the cut is still affecting customers in the area. However, technicians are working to fix things, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354173506884415488"&gt;Verizon said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our goal is to ensure you have working services! Currently, we are aware of a fiber cut in the Brooklyn NY area. This is impacting a some customers in that area. Great thing is that we are aware and have technicians in the field working to get service back up and working for you!&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354173506884415488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to have come from the same places that were experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services in the Northeastern US were tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;We’ve asked Verizon to comment, and the company says it’s looking into it now. Acting Federal Communications Commission chairwoman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360"&gt;Jessica Rosenworcel also said&lt;/a&gt; that the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is looking into the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrJNwU"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have seen reports of internet-related outages on the East Coast, making it difficult for people to work  remotely and go to school online. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FCC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FCC&lt;/a&gt; Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau is working to get to the bottom of what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1354132790044815360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="v6JxWC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 26th, 4:44PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added new information from Verizon about the issues being resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
