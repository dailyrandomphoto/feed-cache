    <title>More ‘record-shattering’ heatwaves are on the way </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7wBufS"&gt;Even more week-long, “record-shattering” heatwaves are coming for us. From now until 2050, if greenhouse gas emissions stay high, the odds of such heatwaves happening are two to seven times greater than they were over the past few decades, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01092-9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. From 2051 to 2080, those prolonged, record-breaking events are expected to become three to 21 times more probable than they were in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bS7dp"&gt;The authors of the new study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Climate Change&lt;/em&gt;, used climate models to come to their conclusions. But there’s already plenty of evidence in the world around us that backs up this study and others that link climate change to more frequent and severe heatwaves. Yet another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;heat dome&lt;/a&gt; is stifling much of the US this week.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That comes after a string of extreme heat events have already smashed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;hundreds of temperature records&lt;/a&gt; across the US this year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CSjqOF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  High pressure aloft will contribute to an excessive heat threat across portions of the Northwest through Tuesday. High temperatures will range between 15 and 25 degrees above average in some places leading to the potential for records being tied or broken. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9XlhIsB9fR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9XlhIsB9fR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWPC/status/1419598418775887873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wnckF"&gt;While records are being broken left and right, there’s another metric to which the study calls attention. The research found that the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of warming influences how insufferable future heatwaves are. So it’s not just how much hotter the world ultimately gets compared to preindustrial times that’s scary. How &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; the planet heats up actually has a bigger impact on the heatwaves we experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujid0S"&gt;When a deadly heatwave hit the Pacific Northwest last month, we saw the dangerous whiplash that can come with a relatively cooler locale suddenly reaching boiling point. Seattle, Washington hit a record-breaking &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/uwem/2021/07/13/hottest-day-ever-in-seattle-june-__-__-2021/#:~:text=On%20June%2028%2C%202021%2C%20the,%2C%20an%20all%2Dtime%20record."&gt;108 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; on June 28th — significantly higher than its previous record of 103 degrees. And while much of the Western US was suffering through the heat that day, the Pacific Northwest saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;disproportionately high spike&lt;/a&gt; in emergency room visits in comparison. The region just wasn’t built for the heat in the way that, say, a desert community might be prepared. Washington’s roads literally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled under the extreme conditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQJKAb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;City planners might want to heed advice from the authors of the new study&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2wgi3s"&gt;While the June 28th temperature record may not be the norm, city planners might want to heed advice from the authors of the new study and prepare for similar situations in the future. “The main message is that we need to prepare for more record heat events in the coming decades that shatter previous record temperatures by large margins,” lead author Erich Fischer said in an email &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/record-shattering-heat-waves-becoming-far-more-likely-study-e13fde50-45d8-4bcd-bc86-efecba6c5217.html"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLtjnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rayssa Leal’s skateboarding went viral on Vine — she just won an Olympic medal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O0E_NPKSuE4fr9M0eJCrhz0SvKQ=/0x60:962x701/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69634673/how_its_going_leal.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zE9oY7"&gt;People may know Rayssa Leal &lt;a href="https://vine.co/v/et37leaez1r"&gt;from a Vine&lt;/a&gt; that showed her landing an incredible heelflip while dressed in a pixie outfit, but today &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Olympics/status/1419531874498658304"&gt;she’s wearing something different&lt;/a&gt;: the silver medal she won for her performance in the 2021 Olympic women’s street skating event. She &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Olympics/status/1419531874498658304?s=20"&gt;also appeared&lt;/a&gt; on the Olympics official Twitter account, which posted a “how it started, how it’s going” meme featuring the 13-year-old skater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AY5W18"&gt;Leal’s &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/rayssa-leal-skateboard-skate-fairy-tokyo-olympics"&gt;profile on the Olympics’ website&lt;/a&gt; says that she was just eight years old when that viral video started spreading across Vine in 2015, after a version that included failed attempts and falls was &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7VndX1A81b/"&gt;posted to her Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, she’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is5m3MxdGeI"&gt;been making a name for herself&lt;/a&gt; in her native country Brazil, and in US and global competitions, before eventually landing at the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ST8NJo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/26/teenagers-olympics-street-skateboarding/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Leal responded to a question about her Olympic win by saying “I don’t want to have responsibility. I want to go on being the lively little girl I am for all of Brazil.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZUcWK"&gt;You can watch &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWz--lUTl5k"&gt;the performance that earned her the silver&lt;/a&gt; down below, which ends with Leal giving the event’s gold medal winner Momiji Nishiya a congratulatory hug. It’s worth a view not only to see &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/26/teenagers-olympics-street-skateboarding/"&gt;two thirteen-year-old girls&lt;/a&gt; show us what Olympic sportsmanship is like, but also for the absolutely incredible frontside feebles — for those impressed by Leal’s Vine appearance, her Olympic showing will be mind-blowing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is reportedly developing a live-action Pokémon series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJZZ154Fh8fZC8vKUoPAV1vhePo=/250x0:1456x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69634597/pokemon_detective_pikachu_photo01.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MI90PO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might not be the last time you see real people interacting with fictional (but real in my heart) pokémon. Netflix is reportedly in early development on a live-action &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; TV series, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/pokemon-netflix-series-live-action-joe-henderson-1235026390/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Lucifer &lt;/em&gt;co-showrunner and executive producer Joe Henderson attached to shepherd the project to a screen near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8TgO7"&gt;It felt almost like a fluke that &lt;em&gt;Detective Pikachu &lt;/em&gt;happened at all, given the relative obscurity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17078436/detective-pikachu-pokemon-preview-nintendo-3ds-creatures-interview"&gt;of the niche &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; spinoff game it was based on&lt;/a&gt; and Nintendo’s seeming reluctance to take big swings on live-action adaptations after the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/7/11876636/super-mario-bros-film-harrowing"&gt;mythically lackluster quality of the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. &lt;/em&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;As of late, though, Nintendo’s been expanding into other mediums — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;like theme parks&lt;/a&gt; — and taking on new partners — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530737/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-nintendo-leak-release-date"&gt;like Ubisoft and its &lt;em&gt;Rabbids&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt; — so maybe the time is right for a popular Netflix show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6He79"&gt;For Netflix, a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; show is just another step toward what it sees as its partially game-driven future. The company already has a hit with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and arguably another with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252386/netflix-tomb-raider-kong-skull-island-anime"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows in the works. It’s also just made it clear that it actually wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;to fund and deliver mobile games to its subscribers&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. A &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; show could continue a relationship with Nintendo it was already reported to be cultivating. As early as 2015, it was rumored that Nintendo and Netflix were developing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/6/7993603/netflix-legend-of-zelda-live-action-series"&gt;a live-action &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, which was reportedly &lt;a href="https://collider.com/what-happened-to-the-legend-of-zelda-netflix-series/"&gt;canceled due to leaks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14Lqzb"&gt;That &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; show never came to fruition and given just how early this &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; project sounds, it’s very possible it ends up going the same way. But Nintendo and Netflix are in very different places than they were half a decade ago. Maybe this time live-action &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; lightning strikes twice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos offers NASA $2 billion to pick Blue Origin’s lunar lander in last-minute plea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-BLUE ORIGIN-BEZOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4m0sqk1QIVveeyKWVHGJ3qLz7I=/39x0:5540x3667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69634549/1142462863.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lBbMJv"&gt;Jeff Bezos is offering NASA a discount of at least $2 billion for the agency to give his space company a lucrative human lunar landing system contract that his rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, won earlier this year. Bezos’ new offer is the latest in an escalating string of efforts to win the contract for Blue Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHyTQ9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson"&gt;Monday morning letter&lt;/a&gt; to NASA administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said he’d &lt;strong&gt;permanently &lt;/strong&gt;waive up to $2 billion in contract payments for the first two years if NASA adds Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lunar lander to a key phase of the agency’s Human Landing System program, which calls for landing the first humans on the lunar surface in decades. On top of that, Blue Origin would self-fund a Blue Moon test launch to low-Earth orbit, a feat likely worth hundreds of millions more. “I believe this mission is important,” Bezos said. “I am honored to offer these contributions and am grateful to be in a financial position to be able to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UfVg3g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All NASA needs to do is take advantage of this offer...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vqDYWG"&gt;NASA didn’t immediately return a request for comment. The plea comes a week before the watchdog&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Government Accountability Office is due to rule on a formal protest of NASA’s award to SpaceX that Blue Origin filed this spring. “All NASA needs to do is take advantage of this offer and amend” the contract, Bezos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qySHrz"&gt;It’s not quite that simple, says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Lori Garver, NASA’s former deputy administrator who oversaw the beginning of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Bezos’ offer is something the agency shouldn’t brush aside, Garver said, but it also might not work out the way Blue Origin wants it to. “I see this as a positive sign overall, but it should not impact the current awards or strategy,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4dkkl"&gt;This all started in April when NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;announced it went with SpaceX’s Starship system&lt;/a&gt; to ferry the first US crew of humans to the Moon in nearly a half-century by 2024, shelving proposals from Blue Origin and another bidder, Dynetics. Those companies are still in the running for a future Moon competition that’s still in the works, but NASA claimed its limited funds from Congress only allowed the agency to choose a single contractor: SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktsafe"&gt;Eventually bringing on more competing contractors, Garver says, “was always the plan, and it is good to know we will now have one putting their own skin in the game too.” That being said, she thinks it’s unlikely that the new offer will change NASA’s mind about the current award. &lt;strong&gt;Agency staff have worried that tweaking NASA’s decision to award SpaceX a lone contract could spawn new legal problems.&lt;/strong&gt; “NASA can’t just ‘take offers’ because funding is offered. There’s absolutely nothing to stop Blue from moving forward with their own money to get in a better position to win something in the next round,” Garver says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcAUFT"&gt;In his letter, Bezos said the $2 billion offer would “bridge the HLS budgetary funding shortfall” and “get the program back on track right now,” appealing to NASA’s speedy 2024 Moonshot deadline and the agency’s ever-present need for more Artemis funding. Blue Origin’s protest of NASA’s decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;halted SpaceX’s $3 billion NASA contract&lt;/a&gt; while the GAO adjudicates the facts of the case. The deadline for the GAO’s ruling is August 2nd, or next Monday. That ruling could recommend — but not force — NASA to restart the award program and revise its decision, or dismiss Blue Origin’s protest and resume NASA’s current plan.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff Bezos’ proposed $2 billion discount on Blue Origin’s lunar lander for NASA comes just after he launched to the edge of space on its space tourism rocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mbgx85"&gt;Since filing its protest, Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22457893/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-spacex-senate-competition-bill-nasa-moon-lander"&gt;set off a strategy&lt;/a&gt; aimed at convincing NASA to issue a “corrective action” on its HLS decision before the GAO comes out with its ruling. Blue Origin’s CEO Bob Smith &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenateCommerce/status/1397250684173623306"&gt;barnstormed&lt;/a&gt; the Capitol in May, and the lengthy GAO protest process afforded Blue Origin lobbyists time to push for legislation that’d allow NASA to spend $10 billion more on its HLS program, a portion of which could hypothetically help fund the company’s lunar lander. But both prongs of their strategy might not follow through as planned. The amendment, which passed the Senate and is being debated in the House, was branded by critics as a “Bezos Bailout.” And GAO protests are rarely successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hq7yTt"&gt;Bezos’ $2 billion discount offer is the company’s latest — and arguably its most desperate — effort to give NASA a reason to pick Blue Origin’s Blue Moon proposal. But it isn’t the first personal offer from Bezos. In 2019, on the heels of a flashy reveal of Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander in Washington, DC, Bezos met with then-NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine at the agency’s headquarters to offer to pay 30 percent of the cost of Blue Origin’s lunar lander demonstration mission, or roughly $200 million at the time, according to three people familiar with the visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb366n"&gt;Since that reveal in DC, Blue Origin assembled a “National Team” of partners including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Under that partnership, Northrop will build Blue Moon’s transfer element, which helps detach the system from a module orbiting the Moon as it begins its trek to the surface. Blue Origin will manage the portion that puts the astronauts on the Moon. And Lockheed will lead crewed flight training and build Blue Moon’s Ascent Element, the portion of the lander that launches from the lunar surface to a space station orbiting the Moon called Gateway. The Monday letter from Bezos also promises to “shield NASA from partner cost escalation concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXraiJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A closer look at Forza Horizon 5’s beautiful take on Mexico</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__RuDsZatPx7zYvySwOQ3044nWw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69634453/FH5_Biome_Rocky_Coast_03_16x9_WM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Playground Games is sharing more about the places you’ll visit in the game&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Eb4019"&gt;One of Microsoft’s biggest reveals at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531138/e3-2021-summer-game-fest-news-announcements"&gt;this year’s E3&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which the company debuted with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532168/forza-horizon-5-trailer-xbox-pc-e3-2021"&gt;a stunning trailer&lt;/a&gt; showing off some of the game’s Mexican locales. Last week, I had a chance to talk with developer Playground Games’ creative director Mike Brown and art director Don Arceta about the game’s open world and the 11 different biomes you’ll be able to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kb7fJt"&gt;There’s a huge diversity of landscapes, including a tree-lined canyon, a jungle with hidden temples, a humid swamp, and even a volcano — it seems like players will be constantly experiencing new and varied terrain. And there should be a lot to see, as &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;’s map is one and a half times larger than the one in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4,&lt;/em&gt; according to Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="511tPQ"&gt;Brown and Arceta both emphasized that there is a lot more vertical exploration in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;than there was in &lt;em&gt;Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;You’ll be able to drive up and down that volcano, for example (and yes, there will be places to launch your car off it, Brown said), as well as drive through hilly streets in the game’s representation of the city of Guanajuato. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="noInTi"&gt;Check out &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;’s 11 biomes for yourself in these screenshots shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The game is set to release on November 9th for the Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The arid hills biome, which has a lot of undulating hills and pockets of trees. This area can be particularly affected by seasonal changes, according to Arceta. “We have a lake that completely dries up in the winter season, as well as the rivers that feed into it,” Arceta said. “That really opens up passages and secret areas for the player to explore.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The canyon biome, where sound can echo around the towering natural formations. “Because it has these big rocky walls, the sound of your car engine can reverb back off those walls,” Brown said. “It’s a really cool effect when you’re driving through there in a hypercar.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The farmland biome. Arceta said this is one of his favorite biomes because of the colors and palettes they can put into the area because of its agriculture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The living desert biome, which is filled with cactuses and foliage as well as rock formations and rock piles. “It’s not a dead, barren landscape,” Brown said. “It’s a really vibrant space despite being a desert.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sand desert biome offers rolling dunes to drive around on. “The sand desert — and a little bit of the living desert — give you that space where when you want to go take a car and reach the absolute max performance of it, that’s a space you can do it,” Brown said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rocky coast biome offers impressive coastal views, and there will also be a resort you can visit. (It has a golf course!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tropical coast biome looks and feels different than the rocky coast with its sandy white beaches and lush palm trees. “I love the tropical coast because it’s the visual in your mind when you think of Mexico when you want to go on vacation and just enjoy the sun, soak it up and be a bit more laid back,” Arceta said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors goes public, collects $4.5 billion </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bh591W"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors is &lt;a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-motors-debuts-on-nasdaq-through-merger-with-churchill-capital-corp-iv"&gt;now a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, following the completion of a merger where it fetched an eye-watering $4.5 billion in fresh capital. Shares of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;Saudi-owned&lt;/a&gt;, California-based startup began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange Monday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AZZBW"&gt;Lucid Motors will now turn its full attention back to an even taller task: getting its first electric car on the road, where it will face stiff competition in the luxury market from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375877/mercedes-benz-eqs-ev-s-class-specs-hands-on"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The startup has said that it plans to start delivering its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;extremely powerful but serenely luxurious&lt;/a&gt; Air sedan later this year, and it has already built more than 100 near-final quality versions at its new factory in Arizona. It has an electric SUV called Gravity in the works, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Thd0wQ"&gt;The public listing is the second in the last week for the industry; fellow EV startup Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587530/faraday-future-nasdaq-ffie-spac-ipo-investors-funding"&gt;became a public company listed on the Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; last Thursday and raised $1 billion in the process. The two startups are just the latest in a growing line of EV startups, autonomous vehicle companies, and automotive suppliers to go public by merging with so-called special purpose acquisition companies, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPACs&lt;/a&gt;, which are publicly listed investment vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3pD2nB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lucid’s luxury sedan — the Air — is supposed to start shipping to customers this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4fMt2"&gt;Unlike many of those other startups, though, Lucid Motors has been around for a while. It was founded in 2007 as a battery company called Atieva. But &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/13/13268450/atieva-atvus-image-tesla-faraday-le-eco"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt; it set out to build an all-electric sedan of its own, and tapped Peter Rawlinson — the former lead engineer of the Model S program at Tesla — to head up the project. (Rawlinson would later become CEO.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDIrKr"&gt;Lucid Motors originally hoped to put the Air into production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;as early as 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But it ran into the same problem that nearly ended the journey for many of its peers: it didn’t have enough money. The startup had raised hundreds of millions of dollars to that point but needed billions, in part because it was also trying to build a factory to build the sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8s3IDq"&gt;Funding for electric vehicle startups was much harder to come by in 2016 and 2017, though, especially as some of them — like Faraday Future — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;began collapsing&lt;/a&gt; in remarkably public fashion. Making matters worse for Lucid Motors was the fact that Faraday Future founder Jia Yueting wound up owning some 30 percent of his rival’s shares. Jia’s ownership became a major problem for potential investors because of his reluctance to sell, as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511540/silicon-valley-foreign-money-china-saudi-arabia-cfius-firrma-geopolitics-venture-capital"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEXWpH"&gt;Talks with investors and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;even automakers like Ford&lt;/a&gt; eventually fell apart, and Lucid Motors took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;loans from a hedge fund and a Chinese bus company to keep the lights on&lt;/a&gt;, using its intellectual property as collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUgUc"&gt;Lucid Motors then found a savior in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. The two sides announced a $1 billion deal in September of that year, just a few weeks before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/us/politics/jamal-khashoggi-killing-cia-report.html"&gt;had &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; journalist Jamal Khashoggi brutally murdered&lt;/a&gt;. That injection of cash, plus subsequent investments from the fund, have given Saudi Arabia majority ownership of Lucid Motors. (It was also a major participant in the funding round that took place alongside the SPAC merger, which is one reason for how Lucid Motors raised so much money in this transaction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XIS80r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unlike some other EV startups, Lucid Motors has been around for a while&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgD1HS"&gt;Saudi Arabia proved to have deep enough pockets to help Lucid Motors fund its extremely expensive ambitions, while also finally buying out Jia’s stake, as filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show. In exchange, it got control of a startup that helps it paint bin Salman’s fantastic picture of making Saudi Arabia a futuristic and far less oil-dependent nation — while also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-20-billion-winner-of-the-american-ev-startup-boom-saudi-arabia-11626687002"&gt;making a boatload of money in the process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ne3vsl"&gt;Lucid Motors started looking at merging with a SPAC to raise money in late 2020 and hired Citi to help with the process. How the startup came together with its eventual SPAC partner is still a matter of some debate, though. In January 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Lucid Motors was in talks with a SPAC run by financier Michael Klein, who used to work for Citi and has ties to Saudi Arabia. But in filings with the SEC, Lucid Motors and Churchill Capital  IV (the SPAC) say that they had not held any talks before that article was published. In fact, they say that article was what brought the two sides together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjvnco"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;proposed merger was announced in February&lt;/a&gt; and in the months since became one of the most-traded SPACs in anticipation of the deal closing. But the merger was held up at the very last minute when, on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588798/lucid-motors-churchill-capital-merger-cciv-lcid-merger-spac-delay"&gt;July 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, Lucid Motors and the SPAC had to publicly plead with shareholders to vote for a key term of the deal that hadn’t yet received enough votes. The reason? Many of those shareholders were new to the market and didn’t know about the vote, or if they did, there was a chance that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588798/lucid-motors-churchill-capital-merger-cciv-lcid-merger-spac-delay"&gt;information about the vote had gone to spam&lt;/a&gt;. Lucid Motors and the SPAC delayed for a day, and eventually received enough votes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Health record company pays hospitals that use its algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coronavirus - Thu Jan 7, 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbup5N94_ij-usHiEKa8Opt6wgo=/0x0:4867x3245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69633862/1230464172.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erZCNm"&gt;The electronic health record company Epic offers financial incentives to healthcare systems that use its proprietary algorithms — and those algorithms can deliver inaccurate predictions, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/26/epic-hospital-algorithms-sepsis-investigation/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqXbdN"&gt;Epic is the largest electronic health record company in the United States, and it holds the health records for around 250 million people. The company has around 20 algorithms designed to predict things like how long a patient might stay in the hospital, which patients might become seriously ill, and which might develop a deadly condition called sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WqJV6"&gt;Like many other groups that build health algorithms, Epic doesn’t publicly share details of how the algorithms are built. Researchers at hospitals that use Epic are able to scrutinize the tools, but any investigations are challenging: they can’t disclose proprietary information and may worry about complicating their employer’s relationships with the company if they publish negative results, &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoWWih"&gt;The studies that &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been done&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the algorithms show that they often don’t work as well as advertised. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545044/algorithm-hospital-sepsis-epic-prediction"&gt;One analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the sepsis algorithm, which Epic says works 76 percent of the time, found it was only right 63 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4qlsq"&gt;Despite the problems with the algorithms, Epic incentivizes hospitals to adopt them. The company’s “honor roll” program has awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars and, in some cases, nearly $1 million to healthcare systems that implement technical upgrades, including the algorithms. “It would be a terrible world where Epic is giving people a million dollars, and the end result is the patients’ health gets worse,” Glenn Cohen, director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard University, told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;. The financial incentives could create a conflict of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YvcVz"&gt;“Epic’s Honor Roll is a voluntary program which encourages the adoption of features that help save lives, increase data exchange, and improve satisfaction for patients, physicians, and health systems,” Epic said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnYBAu"&gt;Some healthcare systems with financial resources and robust information technology departments are able to analyze Epic’s off-the-shelf algorithms and adjust them to fit to their needs. Others, though, may not be able to examine the tools as closely. “The least sophisticated hospitals who don’t have the large data teams are also the ones for whom $1 million is likely to make the most difference,” Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk7oQz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsjbtZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota is quietly pushing Congress to slow the shift to electric vehicles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_zogXHCLC65yw5lczoXIhZdVhhI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69633784/akrales_180328_2351_0621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYMVto"&gt;The US is slowing moving toward adopting policies that would put more electric vehicles on the road, but for Toyota, it’s not slow enough. The Japanese automaker, which is the largest car company in the world, has been quietly lobbying policymakers in Washington, DC to resist the urge to transition to an all-electric future — partly because Toyota is lagging behind the rest of industry in making that transition itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rD2kj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a top Toyota executive has met with congressional leaders behind closed doors in recent weeks to advocate against the Biden administration’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivize the shift to EVs. The executive, Chris Reynolds, has argued that hybrids, like the Toyota Prius, as well as hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles should also be in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oY0YDi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota is lagging behind the rest of industry in making that transition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZQVvz"&gt;In addition, Toyota is also pushing back against EV-friendly policy through the auto industry’s main DC-based lobbying group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. The group, which represents the major car companies and their suppliers and is chaired by Reynolds, has been arguing against the Biden administration’s plan to adopt the so-called California compromise as its official position, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGrQsP"&gt;Last year, a group of car companies made a deal on tailpipe emissions with California, which had been seeking to set tougher rules than the US as a whole. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency had sought to strip California of its power to set its own emissions standards. But under Biden, that rule was reversed, allowing California and other states to impose tougher standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrVHeG"&gt;Toyota, which sided with the Trump administration in its battle with California, was not part of the original compromise. And the company has argued against EV-friendly policies in India and in its native country, Japan, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvPuiZ"&gt;Toyota’s behind-the-scene efforts to slow the momentum behind EV-friendly policies is surprising, given its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. And more recently, the automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roCEmu"&gt;But that doesn’t hide the fact that Toyota has fallen far behind its competitors, appearing content to rest on its laurels while the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. And Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted as much in this article from 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oq7ekF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota’s top executives, including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13yhcU"&gt;Toyota’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ves5zT"&gt;The company came under fire recently after it was revealed that it was &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/what-we-learned-from-the-first-major"&gt;the largest corporate donor to Republican lawmakers who objected to the certification of the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of those politicians also dispute the scientific consensus on climate change. Toyota initially defended the contributions, &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/update-toyota-reverses-course-says"&gt;but then later said it would halt them&lt;/a&gt;. You know things are bad for the company when a Toyota spokesperson has to confirm to the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that the automaker does indeed believe that climate change is real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlFTxu"&gt;Toyota’s argument that hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles should also be included in the conversation is not a bad one. Hybrid vehicles in particular are an important stepping stone to the wider adoption of EVs, especially as the charging infrastructure is still in its infancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aEwS7"&gt;But that argument might carry more weight if the automaker’s track record on fuel economy was actually, well, good. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends-report"&gt;According to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, Toyota has slipped in its ranking in fuel efficiency across its entire fleet, going from an industry leader to near the bottom with GM and Ford. This comes as the company has pushed the sale of huge gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, which tend to command a larger profit than smaller sedans and hatchbacks. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaagcC"&gt;A cross-platform counterterrorism program will start targeting white supremacist and far-right militia material, flagging content for moderation on Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and several other services. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-tech-giants-target-manifestos-militias-database-2021-07-26/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported the news&lt;/a&gt; this morning in an interview with Nicholas Rasmussen, executive director of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdqMKe"&gt;GIFCT — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15875102/facebook-microsoft-twitter-youtube-global-internet-forum-counter-terrorism"&gt;launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt; by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube — maintains a database of terrorist content that helps member companies find it for review or removal. That database initially included material from a United Nations-designated list of sanctioned groups, which meant it focused heavily on Islamist extremist organizations like the Taliban and Islamic State, with exceptions around specific far-right incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Ze7"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; outlines, GIFCT is expanding the list to include material identified by the UN Tech Against Terrorism initiative and the Five Eyes international intelligence partnership. That means adding content from groups like neo-Nazi organizations, the Three Percenters militia, and the Proud Boys, which was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/02/992846086/proud-boys-named-terrorist-entity-in-canada"&gt;designated a terrorist entity&lt;/a&gt; by Canada in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IgkIqX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GIFCT’s database helps Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms flag content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BebqLZ"&gt;The initial GIFCT database included hashed identifiers for images and video, and a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that GIFCT will add three categories of content over the coming months: PDFs of terrorist or violent extremist attackers, terrorist publications that use specific branding and logos, and URLs that are often shared on social networks. Platforms that can access the database — like Reddit, Snapchat, Microsoft’s LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Dropbox — will use the database to make moderation decisions according to their own policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj6uzl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/gifct-erin-saltman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; offers more detail&lt;/a&gt; on what’s being added, describing the expansion as “modest.” In an interview, GIFCT director of programming Erin Saltman says the group is attempting to avoid “scope creep” and will not include all content from loosely organized groups like &lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/05/27/the-boogaloo-movement-is-not-what-you-think/"&gt;the Boogaloo movement&lt;/a&gt; or QAnon — although if a member commits a violent extremist attack, material like a killer’s manifesto might be banned. “There’s a lot of concern of over-censorship, especially when there are such close ties to politics,” says Saltman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dI1mF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of concern of over-censorship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3piFlc"&gt;GIFCT is expanding its list as national governments are taking a closer look at far-right terrorism. The US does not designate domestic terror groups the way it does foreign organizations, but President Joe Biden’s administration has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-donald-trump-joe-biden-business-race-and-ethnicity-84a84878e61009485af6b3542bfbb69a"&gt;pushed for a crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on homegrown extremism, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/three-percenter-capitol-riot.html"&gt;alleged Three Percenters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/19/979304432/4-proud-boys-charged-with-conspiracy-over-jan-6-capitol-riot"&gt;Proud Boys members&lt;/a&gt; were charged with participating in the January 6th riot at the US capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWI2mT"&gt;Saltman notes that companies are wary of GIFCT going beyond existing lists of terrorist groups out of fear it could undermine the credibility of the list. “Even at the UN level, you could not have an agreed-upon definition of terrorism, although they do still have frameworks and designation lists. We’re seeing companies being held to the same standard or above, being asked to go above and beyond what governments are able to do, which makes companies a little wary to be that powerful gatekeeper,” she says. Rasmussen also expressed wariness of over-moderation, saying that “over-achievement in this takes you in the direction of violating someone’s rights on the internet to engage in free expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PpkqH6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always interested in the future — so this week, we’re taking a look at the people who will live there. All week, we’re going to publish stories focused on young people, whether they’re pushing for immigration reform or making bank in the online vintage trade. The way we see it, they’re building the future, and they’re using technology to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNQ2Jo"&gt;We’re calling the series Next Gen, like a next-gen camera or phone. The hope is that human beings will get a little better each time around, with fewer of the hang-ups that plagued earlier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tw4gT"&gt;To kick it off, we’re going to hear from some of those young people firsthand. In a series of four personal essays, we asked young writers to talk about the tech that’s made the biggest impact on their lives, from YouTube videos to multiplayer gaming rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwaD4N"&gt;By the end of the week, you should have a pretty good sense of what the younger generations are up to — and what kind of future they’re building.&lt;/p&gt;
