    <title>Brydge’s excellent iPad Pro keyboards are $50 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GisnuiIf0xksBe0mmAhpgxxji2g=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851430/DSC00765.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gaWNh"&gt;You can do more with your iPad Pro by connecting it to a wireless keyboard, especially one that features a trackpad to help you navigate more like a traditional laptop. Brydge’s Pro Plus wireless keyboards with a trackpad for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzEnLHJyqg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are $50 off at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $170, the model built for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $120. Naturally, the smaller Brydge Pro Plus for the 11-inch iPad Pro costs a bit less. It’s normally $150, but you’ll pay $100 for it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuGfkL"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus is one of a few options available that has a backlit keyboard and a trackpad built in. It connects to your tablet via Bluetooth and recharges via USB-C. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53gQmx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbC6iS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Live review: cool beans|76973" data-volume-uuid="2f0898dea" data-volume-id="76973" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-572" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eaNVny"&gt;Also seeing a steep discount today are Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live, the company’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B6Y618?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;At Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you can score a set for the lowest price yet. Originally $170, they’re just $105 new today in the color of your choosing. In our review, Chris Welch notes that these stand out with a powerful, yet balanced sound and lengthy battery life. Though, the noise cancellation can’t block out a ton of noise, and they might not be a perfect fit if you have very small ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or watch it above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7Ndwz"&gt;Blue is the only color not available through Amazon, but Best Buy has it &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfzETWiLtNU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $120&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Wx2m1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4c510I"&gt;SteelSeries is hosting a member-only 20th anniversary sale on gaming mice, keyboards, headsets, and accessories. If you have an account with the site (making one is free), you can save a considerable amount of money on an upgrade for your PC or console setup. I suggest that you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-sales&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the full list of discounted products here&lt;/a&gt;, but for some hand-picked recommendations, its Aerox 3 Wireless mouse with a lightweight design, waterproofing, and USB-C charging is $70 (usually $100).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GyrAnq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdO5Tl"&gt;As for headsets, its Arctis Pro Wireless unfortunately isn’t looped into the anniversary sale, but the wired version is, which is the next best thing. Normally $250, you can get the Arctis Pro plus a GameDAC system included for $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QhwtZ3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750030"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNQWSY"&gt;Through Thursday, September 16th at 11AM, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/nioh-the-complete-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nioh: The Complete Edition&lt;/em&gt; is free of charge&lt;/a&gt; on the Epic Games Store. This third-person action game was developed by Team Ninja, known for its excellent and difficult &lt;em&gt;Ninja Gaiden&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Nioh &lt;/em&gt;is no different in terms of difficulty, though it usually gets compared to games like &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; in terms of game mechanics and controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cdIg3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Garmin Venu Sq" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WkP_joAPgkX0QzjLfl8PDlrcBSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21902348/12_DSCF3105.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kBP4B"&gt;Lastly, like SteelSeries, Garmin is also hosting an anniversary sale at its site, discounting several of its wrist-based trackers, as well as other accessories. Of note, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F643260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Venu&lt;/a&gt; is $270 (normally $350), while its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F702902&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F9%2F13%2F22671298%2Fbrydge-ipad-wireless-keyboard-steelseries-samsung-galaxy-buds-live-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high-end Fenix 6 watch&lt;/a&gt; is $450 (normally $550). Check out the rest of the products here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye’s first trailer introduces the other Hawkeye and some Christmas hijinks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07xpl7Yh_UQDelW43C5Y3glIDMY=/437x0:1943x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851305/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_9.17.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0UuwC"&gt;The first trailer for Disney Plus’ &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; has arrived, giving a first look at the surprisingly whimsical Christmastime adventures of Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) — and his new successor, Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), who also is running around New York City as a preternaturally skilled, purple-clad archer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS5PM8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; picks up with the titular character after the events of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, which saw Renner’s character flip out into a gothic edgelord style as the murderous vigilante Ronin after his family was wiped from existence in Thanos’ snap. But with things back to normal (and his family restored), Clint just wants to enjoy Christmas with his family: visit New York City, see the new Captain America musical, and enjoy fine dining. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rX9feBatSwn5Lh1mgSZ844MY1Og=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846462/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_9.21.40_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucky the Pizza Dog!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IiEhYU"&gt;All that seems to get thrown into a loop, though, when word of a vigilante wielding a bow and wearing what looks a lot like Barton’s old Ronin suit starts running around New York. It turns out to be Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop, who proudly tells Hawkeye that &lt;em&gt;she’s&lt;/em&gt; the “world’s greatest archer.” From there, it seems a whole bunch of Christmastime mayhem ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1C1ak"&gt;The trailer is particularly notable for its surprisingly light tone: Hawkeye has never been one of the &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;’ more comedic characters, and his previous outing in particular (which again, saw him get a full sleeve tattoo, a tragic haircut, and an international revenge tour) was grim. The new series is expected to draw on the acclaimed Matt Fraction and David Aja comics run (the Tracksuit Mafia and Lucky the Pizza Dog both appear to be in the trailer), which is known for its lighter tone, more grounded stakes, and habit of routinely taking Clint Barton down a peg or two. Although with the Christmas spirit in the air, it also looks like &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; will be taking some pointers from classics like &lt;em&gt;Home Alone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLKZ1w"&gt;Hawkeye is set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1139008/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for a six-episode season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22558074/hawkeye-disney-plus-marvel-november-24th-release-date-announcement"&gt;starting on November 24th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Microsoft’s Surface event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jY_qUbvTjPQay4UnoA-x3sqgtY=/8x0:2392x1589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851281/twarren_surfacecomparison_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UFfxxR"&gt;Microsoft is holding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;Surface event on September 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, where “the company will talk about devices and Windows 11.” With Windows 11 set to debut on October 5th, we’re expecting to see four new Surface devices showcasing all the latest software features in the new OS. It won’t be all Windows 11, though. Microsoft will also launch a second version of its Surface Duo Android-powered foldable device next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOL469"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface hardware announcements starting at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd, and here’s what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QssjzH62OYRWTUFKaGD0FaYJJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329299/twarren_210223_4439_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re expecting a new Surface Pro for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4Nsjmv"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TbRXPE"&gt;The Surface Pro is the main flagship Surface device, and one that has existed since the launch of Windows 8 in 2012. Microsoft is now planning to launch a new Surface Pro 8 ready for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6eDWp"&gt;We’re not expecting any huge design changes on the Surface Pro 8, simply because Microsoft has already made it clear to businesses that it will maintain the Surface port connectivity and overall hardware design to keep it compatible with docks and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIWEu8"&gt;That said, a source familiar with Microsoft’s plans tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is planning to ship a larger display on the Surface Pro 8 with smaller bezels. We also understand Microsoft will move to support Thunderbolt on at least one Surface Pro 8 model. This is the first time Microsoft has supported Thunderbolt on any Surface device, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239517/microsoft-surface-laptops-tablets-thunderbolt-support-security-concerns-comment"&gt;concerns around security&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also planning to drop USB-A ports on at least one Surface Pro 8 model, combined with this Thunderbolt support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oC8Dfk"&gt;Microsoft will also ship its Surface Pro 8 with Intel’s latest 11th Gen chips and support for removable SSDs just like the Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZFVya7"&gt;Surface Book 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDRYR"&gt;Microsoft will also debut its big Surface Book design next week. It’s a significant design change that will involve ditching the detachable display in favor of a display that pulls forward to convert between tablet and laptop form factors much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196266/hp-spectre-folio-leather-laptop-convertible-2-in-1-review-specs-price-features"&gt;like the HP Elite Folio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; these details last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbBWdB"&gt;This new design also allows Microsoft to upgrade the display on the Surface Book 4. We understand Microsoft will opt for a high refresh rate display on the Surface Book 4, possibly up to as high as 120Hz to support a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555295/microsoft-windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-laptops"&gt;new Windows 11 Dynamic Refresh Rate feature&lt;/a&gt;. This will allow the Surface Book 4 to include smooth scrolling, and then switch down to standard 60Hz modes to save battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ERXqk"&gt;This dynamic refresh rate will also help improve inking on the Surface Book 4, as inking will switch to high refresh rates. Microsoft is also improving the Surface Pen that works with the Surface Book 4 to include haptic feedback. It will also snap to the side of the Book 4 and support charging when it’s there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xz03mb8UXURRnhDwMOUrEEbiBl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21980183/twarren_201020_4246_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft will have a new Surface Pro X ready for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ripPRi"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EUAG1U"&gt;Microsoft is also expected to launch a new Surface Pro X model next week. While there won’t be any major design changes, we’re expecting a chip upgrade inside and possibly even a high refresh rate display. We’ve heard Microsoft has been testing high refresh rate displays on the Surface Pro or Surface Pro X line, and we’ll find out next week if Microsoft has managed to upgrade its displays on the Surface Pro lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JxET4i"&gt;Surface Go 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp3ry8"&gt;The final Windows-powered Surface device we’re expecting next week is the Surface Go 3. This smaller Surface will maintain the same smaller footprint design but with a big upgrade inside. We’re told at least one model will ship with Intel’s Core i3 processor, offering better performance for this smaller Surface than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;existing Pentium Gold processor models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtHemv"&gt;We’re also hoping to see Microsoft move away from models with 4GB of RAM and the slower eMMC storage on base models. The Surface Go 3 looks like a modest upgrade in time for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78nJzAewY4SnWAvHLnYtdij1miI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740410/surfaceduo2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 leak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LoMx"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ps7dME"&gt;Microsoft also looks set to debut its next Surface phone. The successor to the Surface Duo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;already leaked online&lt;/a&gt;, offering an early glimpse at what to expect. The biggest hardware upgrade will be a triple-camera system that includes ultrawide, telephoto, and standard camera lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3R3GVd"&gt;The triple-camera system will add a camera bump to the rear of the device, as seen in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaked photos earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The Surface Duo 2 should also ship with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor, with 5G support and an NFC reader, both of which were missing from the first generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QklcUP"&gt;Microsoft is also making some other minor changes to the hardware on the Surface Duo 2, including moving its fingerprint reader into the power button on the Duo 2 and centering the USB-C port on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKaBs0"&gt;The real questions around the Surface Duo 2 will be its software changes. The original Surface Duo has struggled with its software support for dual displays, and the successor is expected to ship with Android 11. This should help with some dual-screen support, but Microsoft will also have to offer far better software support to make the Surface Duo 2 successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ql4YB1"&gt;
&lt;p id="m1yMwf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface hardware announcements on September 22nd. The event kicks off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, so stay tuned for all the latest Surface news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BuddyPhones Cosmos Plus are full-featured travel headphones for kids</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Bluetooth, noise cancellation, volume limiting — these kids’ headphones have it all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pzaVj1"&gt;In my home, headphones for my kids tend to be a hand-me-down affair. When I’ve upgraded to something newer or better, I pass down my old cans to my kids to use with their tablets or Chromebooks. But this is less than ideal for a variety of reasons: the older headphones might be lacking features like Bluetooth or noise cancellation; what fits my oversized head likely won’t sit comfortably on their kid-sized domes; and standard headphones don’t have a way to limit their maximum volume, which can lead to hearing loss in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvJLhv"&gt;That’s where the BuddyPhones Cosmos Plus come in. The $99.99 Cosmos Plus check off every feature you might want in a pair of kids’ headphones. Bluetooth? Yup. Noise cancellation? You got it. Volume limiting? Three different levels, as a matter of fact. Kid-friendly aesthetics and size? Yes and yes. They come in six different colors with cartoon graphics on the ear cups and have a color-matched hard case, USB-C charging cable, 3.5mm cable, and boom mic all in the box. Though some parents may balk at spending $100 on headphones for their kids, you can’t deny that there’s a lot of value packed in the Cosmos Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwqA5UvHjUwvWao_UIjC3gWbp5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844890/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus come with a color-matched hard case, charging cable, audio cable, and boom mic in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBpoOO"&gt;The Cosmos Plus have a colorful, all-plastic design, with a padded headband and plush ear cups. Their 227-gram weight makes it easy for smaller heads to wear them without getting tired, and they have a wide range of size adjustment, from small enough to fit on a five-year-old’s head to big enough to stretch over my larger-than-average adult-sized cranium. Though these won’t compare to higher-end wireless headphones in terms of materials and build quality, they are sturdy and flexible and don’t feel like they will break immediately. The included hard case helps ensure they won’t break when tossed in a bag or not being used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqtmLZ"&gt;The outside of the ear cups have cartoon graphics — a fairy princess and rainbow unicorn on the models I tested, with a lion, cartoon DJ, scientist, and pirate on the other color options — and you can get them in pink, white, yellow, gray, blue, or dark blue depending on your child’s preference. There’s no mistaking the fact that these were designed with kids in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4HJeKCYWn3IohffuspSK1HRj-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844899/BuddyPhones_Cosmos__combined_all_colors.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus come in six different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YlI2ZF"&gt;I was able to test the Cosmos Plus for a few weeks with my own six-year-old and nine-year-old. We used them at home during their allotted screentime and during two long road trips. For the most part, my kids liked the headphones — there were no complaints of discomfort or inability to hear their videos or games, and they both liked the cartoon designs on the ear cups. My spouse and I appreciated the silence in the car as we crossed hundreds of miles without any bickering or arguing between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JAF4h"&gt;As for the audio specs, the Cosmos Plus have 40mm neodymium drivers, similar to many other over-ear Bluetooth headphones. The sound quality isn’t going to remotely compete with the best from Apple or Sony — there is bass, but it’s not especially pronounced, and instruments can get lost in the mix easily — but it’s average for this price point and just fine for the music or content kids might use them with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDHwWN"&gt;More importantly, the Cosmos Plus have three levels of volume limiting: 75dbA, 85dbA, and 94dbA. The default mode is the 85dbA setting, which BuddyPhones identifies as the “kids mode.” The lowest setting is meant for the extra-sensitive ears of toddlers (BuddyPhones recommends the Cosmos Plus for ages three and up), while the highest setting is dubbed “travel mode” and is designed to overcome the noise of an airplane engine. Sounds above 85dbA are &lt;a href="https://www.mottchildren.org/health-library/tf4173"&gt;considered harmful and should be limited as much as possible&lt;/a&gt;, according to hearing experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJy7X5"&gt;All three levels of volume limiting are available when the headphones are used in Bluetooth mode, while the wired mode is set to the 85dbA limit. Changing the mode requires holding volume up and volume down buttons together for two seconds, which will cycle the headphones through the various modes. It’s relatively simple for parents to change but not obvious for kids to do on their own. Though I don’t have the gear to validate BuddyPhones’ specific decibel claims for each level, there is a noticeable difference with how loud each setting allows the headphones to be and the middle setting is certainly lower than the max volume my own headphones reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZTAVIV477JlWtnKOKdiZu-wnOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844892/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The right ear cup has the power / pairing button and volume up and down, plus the USB-C charging port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FeYPU0rkNei3itjCASpPlc_J0y8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844891/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left ear cup is a switch to turn on Study Mode, as well as a button to enable the active noise cancellation, which works in both wired and wireless modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KlB87z"&gt;Further aiding the volume limiting feature is the Cosmos Plus active noise cancellation, which can be used in either wired or wireless modes. A button on the left ear cup turns the ANC on or off, with a green light indicating it’s on. The noise cancellation won’t silence the world in the way the best noise canceling headphones on the market can, but it is effective enough to help reduce low frequency sounds like a constant fan, road noise, or the drone of an airplane cabin. Having noise cancellation is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-your-kids-headphones-permanently-damaging-their-hearing#How-can-parents-help-protect-young-ears?"&gt;generally recommended for kids&lt;/a&gt;, since it allows them to hear their music or video easier without having to turn up the volume more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTwGy2"&gt;The Cosmos Plus also have a “Study Mode,” which is activated by a switch on the left ear cup. The company says this boosts the midrange and “lowers down part of the audio spectrum which is not on the voice human spectrum and can impact audibility of a voice.” It’s also designed to make it easier to hear voices when on video calls. The Cosmos Plus have microphones on the ear cup and the detachable boom mic that can be used instead. But neither are particularly great — I tested the Cosmos Plus on a day of Zoom calls for work and had mixed results. My colleagues said the boom mic caused my voice to clip, producing a crackling sound, while the ear cup mic had a noticeable echo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Caub5TEqr-KWD1R1W7KqN9cJDeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844893/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included boom mic plugs into the USB-C port, but it still doesn’t provide the best voice quality for calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4UaoI1"&gt;Lastly, the Cosmos Plus have the ability to share their audio with another set of wired headphones, simply by plugging them into the 3.5mm headphone jack on the left ear cup. This is a convenient feature when two kids are watching the same movie on a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rCqlz"&gt;But despite the long list of features, there is room for improvement, particularly in how the Cosmos Plus are powered on and off. Instead of a switch to go from off to on to pairing mode, the Cosmos Plus rely on long-pressing a single button located between the volume buttons. A one-second press will turn the headphones on and flash a blue light; do the same when they are on and the light will flash red and turn the headphones off. But if you hold that button down for a second or two too long and miss the first light flash, the Cosmos Plus will go into their pairing mode and you have to release the button and hold it down again for five seconds before they fully shut off and you can start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUK6AFG0mnfTtAdLi-Meg6Spw50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844895/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cosmos Plus are light enough and small enough for kids to wear for hours at a time without discomfort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1RnCTR_nqlfB58w-3U3tFGIajk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22844897/dseifert_4749_buddyphones_cosmos_plus_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even older kids can appreciate the Cosmos Plus’ set of features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WV91Lv"&gt;This made it difficult for the kids to turn the headphones on and off themselves — nearly every time they wanted to use them my spouse or I would have to handle turning them on and making sure they connected to their tablets correctly. If they didn’t turn the headphones off properly when they were done, they risked running the battery down unnecessarily in the case. Though I appreciate the button controls over the touch swiping that a lot of modern Bluetooth headphones use, the power button should really be a switch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEvGPS"&gt;Additionally, while it’s nice to have the noise cancellation separate from the Bluetooth controls, allowing it to work both wired and wirelessly, it also meant that sometimes the kids would remember to turn it on and sometimes they wouldn’t. They would also forget to turn off the ANC when they put the headphones away, since the button is separate from the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oBfS2"&gt;As for battery life, BuddyPhones claims up to 24 hours between charges. I don’t think they lasted quite that long in our testing, but they do last long enough that we only have to charge them once a week or so at home. They also lasted through an 11-hour car ride with plenty of juice to spare, though they were not being used the entire time. Charging is done through the USB-C port and takes a couple of hours to top them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYO1yt"&gt;In all, there’s little to complain about with the Cosmos Plus. They have a wide set of features, including the important things like volume limiting and noise cancellation; come in a bunch of colors kids like; and have all the necessary accessories in the box. Though the power button situation can certainly be improved and the microphones aren’t as good as more expensive headphones, the Cosmos Plus are an ideal travel headphone for kids and certainly better than my old hand-me-downs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Apple’s iPhone 13 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2WnJedXB1sVhcLhp4xichPG_Tk=/166x0:1123x638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851117/Screenshot_2021_09_10_7.38.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IlLw7g"&gt;Apple’s first fall event is coming up on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Tuesday, September 14th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;, right around the time when the company typically introduces its latest version of the iPhone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21508028/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-homepod-mini-event-recap-biggest-announcements"&gt;Like last year’s iPhone event&lt;/a&gt;, Tuesday’s announcements will be entirely digital, in the slick, over-produced style that’s become Apple’s trademark during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Du1zo1"&gt;Rumors suggest a potentially less dramatic set of announcements compared to the iPhone 12’s radical flat-edged design. It does seem like the Apple Watch and AirPods could get some serious attention, though, even if the iPhone 13 looks more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0h080"&gt;Keep reading below for a roundup of everything we expect to see at the event, including some long-shot surprises Apple could have in store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone 12 mini (left) and iPhone 12 (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8833rrFzFziADRLiBLUiwc7W2Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023082/vpavic_4279_20201107_0180.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ewr5Bs"&gt;An iPhone 13 with a familiar design and maybe a new nighttime camera trick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HaEvbK"&gt;Rumors suggest that the iPhone 13 will look a lot like the iPhone 12 but with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;a possibly smaller notch and high refresh rate displays&lt;/a&gt; on all or most models. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; seem to be in agreement that the new iPhone will receive iterative if helpful changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUBVbq"&gt;Those could include an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display like Apple uses to provide variable refresh rates on the Apple Watch. The new phone hardware may also include &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/04/rumors-iphone-13-to-feature-larger-wireless-charging-coil-alongside-stronger-magsafe-magnets/"&gt;stronger magnets, a larger charging coil for MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/14/iphone-13-always-on-display-matte-back/"&gt;always-on display&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/iphone-13-fewer-storage-options-and-new-colors/"&gt;new colors and fewer storage options&lt;/a&gt;. A new A-series processor is naturally in the cards as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXLloq"&gt;The star of Apple’s iPhones, the cameras, will likely also receive an upgrade with the iPhone 13. Improved performance for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553255/apple-iphone-13-camera-2021-ming-chi-kuo-analyst-prediction"&gt;the ultrawide camera&lt;/a&gt;, better optical zoom for video recording, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/apple-readies-new-iphones-with-pro-focused-camera-video-updates"&gt;ProRes support, and a Portrait Mode for video&lt;/a&gt; have all been rumored. The other possible addition is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/"&gt;astrophotography capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to compete with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203782/google-removes-wide-angle-astrophotography-pixel-4a-5g-5"&gt;a similar feature&lt;/a&gt; Google has offered in the past. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840?s=20"&gt;An event announcement video&lt;/a&gt; tweeted by Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Greg Joswiak featuring a dramatic pan up to a starry night sky may have added more fuel to that specific fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g1aETW"&gt;A flat-edged Apple Watch Series 7 with a bigger screen and the same health features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MeuKUr"&gt;While the iPhone 13 is staying consistent, it seems the Apple Watch Series 7 might get a more involved redesign. The rounded body Apple’s used since the introduction of its smartwatch is rumored to be replaced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;with flatter displays and edges&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. The change sounds similar to the shift Apple made from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Grz5"&gt;Earlier this year, news broke that Apple was also possibly introducing an entirely separate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22351979/apple-watch-rugged-extreme-sports-rumor-bloomberg"&gt;more rugged, extreme sports-friendly version of the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors have coalesced around the iPhone 12-inspired Series 7 since but not this sports version. We’ll have to wait and see if it arrives this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjio0g"&gt;Other improvements to the mainline Series 7 could include a faster processor and overall bigger watches at 41mm and 45mm (up from 40mm and 44mm), thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;a combination of larger displays, smaller bezels, or both&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. It’s not clear if that would impact the compatibility of the many watch bands Apple has sold over the years, but here’s hoping it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yyugr"&gt;Those hardware changes will allow for new watchfaces, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman, but likely not new health features. Despite rumors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532916/apple-watch-series-7-features-blood-glucose-body-temperature-extreme-sports-edition-se-2"&gt;body temperature and blood glucose tracking&lt;/a&gt;, now it seems Apple might leave those additions for future models. Complicating matters further, though, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666305/apple-series-7-manufacturing-issues-resolved-september-mass-production"&gt;reportedly resolved production delays&lt;/a&gt; for the new Watch, some versions &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1436226530598817815?s=20"&gt;could arrive late or in smaller quantities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="F57Mhj"&gt;Third-generation AirPods with some AirPods Pro-inspired looks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="imEUed"&gt;The entry-level third-generation AirPods are also rumored to be in line for a makeover. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;Early word in 2020&lt;/a&gt; pointed to a design that takes cues from the AirPods Pro, minus the earbuds’ swappable rubber tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdxNzc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Further corroboration in 2021&lt;/a&gt; suggests the same. It seems you can expect shorter stems, rounded earpieces, and a squatter wireless charging case that might have a 20 percent larger battery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PineLeaks/status/1435302679014739970?s=20"&gt;according to Pine Leaks&lt;/a&gt;. In general, the new AirPods might finally look a bit less like headphones with the wires cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qwruU3"&gt;The launch of iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey, with a few ingredients missing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1qfN18"&gt;Apple is expected to announce the launch dates for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey, though the company has confirmed some features will arrive late or in beta form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4DRGp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, which finally brings proper, moveable widgets to the iPad for the first time along with other improvements, will likely arrive in late September with the iPhone 13. Notable upgrades include Focus Modes that create approved notification and app lists for specific settings like work or personal time, a dramatic redesign of Safari (that’s now settled into something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629183/ios-15-beta-safar-address-bar-fix-options-accessible-controls"&gt;a bit more familiar&lt;/a&gt;), new FaceTime layouts and audio improvements, a possible future source of controversy in digital IDs, and yet another tweak to multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWlynE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8 is also expected in the fall&lt;/a&gt; with more modest upgrades. Along with support for Focus Modes and new digital keys and IDs, watchOS 8 brings new watchfaces (including a nice photo one), new exercise types (pilates time to shine), and a mindfulness app to Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7omTiC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; could come later in the fall (perhaps timed to the launch of a new Mac computer). The new desktop OS continues to pick up features from Apple’s mobile OSes, like support for Shortcuts, AirPlay, and helpful changes to FaceTime and Messages. The most exciting new Monterey feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, allows for seamless control of an iPad with the mouse and keyboard already attached to your Mac. That includes easily dragging and dropping files from iPad to Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNWBKl"&gt;Unfortunately, Universal Control might not be there at launch. The feature has yet to be included in a beta, and Apple has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;announced delays for SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s take on group watch plug-ins and Discord screen sharing that became all the rage early on in the pandemic. Luckily, other features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;previously limited to Apple’s M1-based devices&lt;/a&gt; — like Live Text — are coming to older Intel machines. You win some, and you lose some, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eyTC3Z"&gt;Possibly a longer wait for new iPad Minis, iPads, and Macs of all stripes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ul7qvE"&gt;It really seems like updates to the entry-level iPad and the long-ignored iPad Mini are happening; the question is when. Apple could reserve the devices for a later event in October rather than hang with a new iPhone and Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFHF0J"&gt;The new iPad Mini is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;expected to receive the flat-edged design&lt;/a&gt; that’s apparently sweeping through Apple’s entire product line, along the usual processor improvements, a larger screen between 8.5 to 9 inches, no home button, and a Touch ID sensor built directly into the power button. The entry-level iPad changes are expected to be more minor — thinner bezels and body and the inclusion of an A13 Bionic chip, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/20/new-ipad-mini-exclusive-a15-processor-usb-c/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeRsUa"&gt;Even less likely are new Macs, whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;a new Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;Macbook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Apple will probably want to schedule some separate time to announce whatever it has planned for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;next version of the M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; and the new designs that could come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0Crt2"&gt;That’s a whole lot of possible announcements, not even taking into account a tease for longer-term Apple projects like the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;continued exploration of AR and VR&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to hear about it all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to sell or trade in your old iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T70nzkoDsN25RaoDxSoNkLFe0ws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851082/jbareham_170916_2000_0232.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2qn1u"&gt;If you’re an iPhone owner, it’s very possible you’re considering trading up to the latest model, which (when this article was last updated) is likely to be the iPhone 13. However, if your current iPhone is still in good shape, you may be wondering about what to do with it. Should you sell it? Trade it in? Give it away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXGfsW"&gt;Well — any of the above. This guide will walk you through the process of preparing your old phone, and what your best alternatives are for disposing of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y9FVIs"&gt;Are you transferring to a new iPhone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DHovgw"&gt;If you’re transferring to a new iPhone — or even if you’re not — you probably want to back up your phone before you do anything else (see below). Backing up to iCloud is probably easiest — and it also gives you the option of transferring your data either directly from your old phone to your new phone, or transferring your data from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NF8gC"&gt;Once you’ve done that, then go ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20871131/data-transfer-new-iphone-11-pro-max-ios-how-to"&gt;copy all your data to your new phone&lt;/a&gt;. If you want, you can also try going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone.” Depending on the version of iOS you’re running, you may have access to a wizard called “Prepare for New iPhone,” which will run you through all the steps necessary to transfer your data to your new phone. (It will also let you check your phone’s trade-in Status.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It doesn’t hurt to check that your iPhone is back up to iCloud." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8sugnJrj_qQoBajv2ry2xUaLYbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838046/IMG_D79739CF9DAE_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It doesn’t hurt to check that your iPhone is backed up to iCloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “Transfer or Reset Phone” you’ll find a wizard to walk you through the process." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtRfDLKH_olAw2egNZ1dIhjsZ5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838053/IMG_D831063B05A8_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “Transfer or Reset Phone” you’ll find a wizard to walk you through the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PMsgrZ"&gt;Back up your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ffuR80"&gt;As mentioned above, it’s a good idea to have a current backup of all of your data saved on iCloud, your laptop, or any other local / cloud storage.  Backing up your phone on iCloud Backup is probably the easiest. If it’s been a while and you want to make sure backup is switched on in your phone’s iCloud settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ntzmom"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “iCloud Backup.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEEtWS"&gt;If “iCloud Backup” is switched off, toggle it on. If it’s already toggled on, and you’re preparing to wipe your old iPhone, you may want to tap “Back Up Now” just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nGLcQ1"&gt;You can also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-up-iphone-iph3ecf67d29/ios"&gt;back up your iPhone to a computer&lt;/a&gt;: either to your Mac by using your Finder (if your Mac is using a macOS version before 10.15, you’ll use iTunes) or to a Windows PC (again, using iTunes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6qWjaR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge guide to the iPhone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/21/17828022/iphone-user-guide-how-to-ios-tips"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3W7ILm"&gt;Wipe your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfFOB"&gt;When you’re sure that all of your data is stored — and you’ve transferred all your data to your new phone — it’s time to wipe your old phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJzHI1"&gt;First, you have to make sure you’ve gotten rid of a few identifiable features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uUBuwb"&gt;Disable “Find My iPhone” by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Find My” &amp;gt; “Find My Phone” and toggling “Find My Phone” and “Find My Network” to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQ6OXX"&gt;Unpair any devices from your phone, including your Apple Watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMREGp"&gt;Toggle iMessages off (just in case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="g1y20x"&gt;Then you need to sign out from your Apple ID:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t9tT4x"&gt;	Select “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “Sign Out” (at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LaxEWl"&gt;	Enter your Apple ID password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xmVLyK"&gt;	You’ll be asked if you want to keep a copy of your data on this iPhone. Assuming you’ve backed everything up and are about to wipe your phone, you don’t need to toggle anything on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZdkhV"&gt;	Tap on “Sign Out” in the upper right corner, and then again on the “Are you sure?” pop-up window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1ucZCq"&gt;Finally, get ready to erase it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHqjWX"&gt;Remove the SIM card from the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72iH92"&gt;Go into “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone”  and select “Erase All Content and Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/piUZnlaqfVeSDb64HBCoO6H3iqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838056/IMG_C0157C8B9455_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re wiping your phone, you don’t want to keep any data on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll get one last chance to change your mind." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMHILye-QLRmP11cto9ODExlSS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838059/IMG_BB1A5D632ACF_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get one last chance to change your mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XBA7Rz"&gt;Clean it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqdesG"&gt;Before you even think of selling your phone, you need to make sure it’s looking its best. Remove the case and / or any stickers, and assess the damage you can see, including scratches or dents, which you’ll have to mention when selling the phone. Then, clean your phone using a screen wipe or screen cleaner. (You might want to leave your screen protector on if it’s in good condition.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZfhwf"&gt;It’s also a good idea to take photos of your phone. You’ll need them for the listing when selling the phone online; in addition, they’re useful in case the recipient reports further damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cNdcWI"&gt;Sell your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tUf4or"&gt;There are a variety of places where you can try to sell your used phone. A few of those are listed here, along with the estimates I got for an iPhone 11 in good condition with 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0Rtla"&gt;The first thing you might think of is to trade your phone in to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This may be especially useful if you haven’t bought your new iPhone yet, and you want to see if you can save a little on your new device. If you’ve already bought your new phone, then you can go to Apple’s trade-in page and see what your phone is worth. Note that in return you’ll be getting a gift card for future Apple purchases. The quote for the iPhone 11 was $390 in trade-in value at the time of publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjsLE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decluttr.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decluttr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; buys the phone from you and then resells it. The company gives you a price online; you then ship your phone to Decluttr within 28 days. The phone will be inspected; if there are issues, you will be offered a revised price which you will have 14 days to accept or decline. An iPhone 11 in good condition with 256GB received a quote for $401.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JQzg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Fbest-buy-trade-in%2Fpcmcat133600050011.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Buy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you either mail in your phone or bring it to your nearest Best Buy retail store; either way, you can trade it in for an e-gift card. My iPhone 11 was given an estimated value of $360 (increased to $400 if traded in for specific tech products).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F5SmE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://flipsy.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flipsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deals with a variety of retail sites; it will let you know what vendors offer how much, and then you get 14 days to ship the device. The vendor pays for shipping. If the vendor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they will send a revised offer; since each vendor has its own return policies, it’s a good idea to check before you ship. The iPhone 11 got prices from two vendors; the highest was $455.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YPx3L"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://swappa.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swappa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you create a listing along with a price; when your device is sold, you receive payment from Swappa and then ship the phone directly to the buyer. Swappa charges a fee from the buyer, depending on the price of the phone, but you are responsible for shipping costs. The average price that an iPhone 11 with 256GB could be sold for was quoted as $543.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Gx6n"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664451%2Fiphone-13-sell-trade-in-old-apple-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Selling here can be a bit complicated, but basically you get up to 250 listings for free each month; once you sell your item, there is a 10.2 percent fee plus a $0.30 transaction fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktxNwU"&gt;Places where you can sell your phone free of charge (except, of course, for shipping fees) include &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/selling/"&gt;Facebook Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://craigslist.org"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;, and the subreddits &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/phoneswap/"&gt;r/Phoneswap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appleswap/"&gt;r/Appleswap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/"&gt;r/Hardwareswap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3t6ZHP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you don’t want to sell or trade in your old phone, there are other things you can do with it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rx0YPR"&gt;Play it safe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t0XZEr"&gt;Most of these transactions take place via mail. However, if you decide to do the transaction in person, it’s safest to meet in a public place — and these days, if you’re at all concerned about infection, to either do it outdoors in a park or other public space, or in a cafe or other indoor venue that follows current safety recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eicK6g"&gt;And if you decide you don’t want to sell or trade in your old phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542079/phone-reuse-android-iphone-how-to"&gt;there are other things you can do with it&lt;/a&gt;, including using it as a webcam or letting it be your kids’ first grown-up phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhSxUq"&gt;Whatever you decide to do with your old phone, just make sure you’re happy with your new phone first. You don’t want to have to return that brand-new phone because of problems (or because you just don’t like it) and suddenly find yourself desperately scrounging around for a temporary substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0PHLx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 10th, 2021, 2:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on January 14th, 2020 and has been updated to account for differences in iOS and in available services and websites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toem is a charming photography game in black and white</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQrB2HoD4YHghvK7i1AlF34TQS4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69851075/vlcsnap_2021_05_07_14h46m05s312.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Toem&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Something We Made&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUqOIj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; is a delightful game about photography. Its emphasis on exploration and low stakes felt vastly different from another photography game I played this year, &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;. And to my surprise, I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt; a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaRi5A"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;, developed by &lt;a href="https://www.somethingwemade.se/"&gt;Swedish indie studio Something We Made&lt;/a&gt;, you play as a character armed with a camera who wanders through a number of different themed areas, such as a forest and a city, taking pictures of what you find along the way. The bulk of your exploration takes place from an isometric point of view, but when you use your camera, the game shifts to a first-person perspective, often giving you a whole new look at the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MbqidX4_djCYyXLyqGIxvK6e3Nw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837206/vlcsnap_2021_05_04_13h05m56s815.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The camera view in &lt;/em&gt;Toem&lt;em&gt;. Yes, you can take selfies.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cjPWBP"&gt;Usually, you’ll use your camera to take pictures of animals, interesting landmarks, or specific things for a quest. But sometimes, that first-person view is the only way to see some things that might be out of sight while in the isometric view, such as what might be under a bridge. That encouraged me to constantly pick up my camera as I was playing and scan the world around me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw7ieu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;’s charming black-and-white art style is a joy to take in; I especially liked how things looked like they’re made from paper and cardboard. The characters, meanwhile, seem as if they were plucked right out of a Nickelodeon cartoon. The sound design is also excellent. There are a lot of pleasant music tracks that help you settle into the game’s relaxed mood, and characters speak in charming gibberish like what you might have heard in &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awEFtu"&gt;To progress through &lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;, you accept quests to take certain photos or to find items in the world. Once you complete enough quests, you can advance to the next area. Often, the tasks you can complete are quite silly, such as bringing a ghost to a perfect date spot or finding a lost balloon so it can attend its birthday party. And you don’t need to do every available quest to be able to move onto the next area, so if you can’t figure one out, it’s not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_CKoh0CEenjjEppf36hxput3E8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837234/vlcsnap_2021_05_04_13h01m16s154.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Something We Made&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One quest involves finding this person’s dog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oUqGlx"&gt;The game encourages you to explore each nook and cranny, gives you a lot of freedom in how to go about things, and has a wonderful playfulness about it all. It also made me realize just how much I hope the next &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; borrows from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZfyWT"&gt;I was really excited for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I found its structure, which forces you down curated routes that you have to play repeatedly (and, for a good chunk of the game, without any way to boost through them), to be frustratingly limiting. I also didn’t like how you could miss photo opportunities; it added an unnecessary level of anxiety to a game about calm nature rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e35fqp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, is a lot more relaxed and open, and for me, that lets me have a lot more fun playing photographer. I always had my eye out for things like hidden animals in the trees, cool graffiti on walls, or even just somebody’s cat. And without any pressure or punishment to miss a photo, I was much more motivated to snap anything that looked interesting or seek out certain photos to help out a quest-giver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlOOYP"&gt;When I played &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year, I wanted it to recapture the feeling of discovery I had while playing the original on Nintendo 64. Instead, it was a black-and-white game that asked me to photograph a deer DJ that brought me back to that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfSAFP"&gt;Toem&lt;em&gt; launches September 17th on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deathloop is an intricate mystery that also happens to be an amazing action game  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stDMqCO5Hhhr5q9vWNRL88UGTVk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850900/Deathloop_Map_of_Blackreef_863726099713bed9a51.13118819.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hard to explain, easy to get lost in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="27LVGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is the first game to make me risk my life for an audiolog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLbyYN"&gt;It’s the latest release from Arkane Studios, a studio best known for helping keep the lineage of “immersive sims” alive through first-person action games like &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prey&lt;/em&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; most certainly fits into that lineage, with its stealth-focused exploration, supernatural abilities, and open-ended gameplay that almost always gives you a handful of ways to tackle a problem. On a moment-to-moment basis it’s as tense, thrilling, and creative as any Arkane release should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWZvBg"&gt;That’s just the start with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, though. What makes the game so interesting is its structure, which has players — in the role of an assassin named Colt — reliving the same day over and over again. (Between this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630397/12-minutes-review-steam-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure what it is with game developers and time loops lately.) This conceit turns &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; into a game where investigation is as important as combat. You aren’t just fighting to survive, you’re doing it to learn new information that will help you unravel the strange and complex mystery at the heart of the game. It’s that mystery that will help pull you through the same day repeatedly, digging through dangerous locations in search of scraps of crucial information to hopefully make the next loop just a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vB9wa"&gt;I’ll do my best to summarize &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s premise, but it’s not easy. It starts when Colt wakes up on a beach of what turns out to be an island called Blackreef, which looks like a supervillain’s lair from the 1960s. Quickly he learns that Blackreef is run by a homicidal woman named Julianna and that its residents relive the same day in a loop. A few, like Julianna, keep their memories from loop to loop, and have decided that they want to keep things the way they are. Colt, naturally, does not, and decides he’s going to stop the loop once and for all. In order to do so, he needs to kill Julianna and seven “visionaries” from Blackreef. The twist is that he has to kill them all in a single day without dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="JFLY4O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLIgM8XX1X0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="69sThj"&gt;The ultimate goal in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is basically one big puzzle you slowly piece together. Blackreef is an intricate island divided into four districts, and each day is split up into four time periods: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening. Over the course of the game you’ll explore each area, at different times of day, and steadily Blackreef will open up. Colt retains his memories after each loop, so as you discover shortcuts or passcodes for gated areas, that information sticks with you. Eventually I found myself knowing areas inside and out, able to stealthily make my way through the quickest paths; it’s a very satisfying kind of mastery. The end goal of all of this information-gathering is to learn as much as you can about the island and its visionaries so that you can figure out how to kill them all within the constraints of a single day. Information is, as they say, power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DRRwRB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s one big puzzle you slowly piece together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lkZXX6"&gt;This probably sounds pretty confusing, and it is, but the game does an incredible job of easing you along so you don’t get overwhelmed. The main menu is basically an evidence board that lets you track all of the information for each visionary, so that you’re tackling everything in a series of small steps. Likewise, the game is divided into relatively bite-sized chunks, as you explore areas over specific time periods like morning or evening, almost always with a specific goal in mind. Sometimes that could be as big as killing a boss. Other times it just means finding a way into a locked apartment in search of a passcode. Put simply: while the overarching goal is huge and complicated, the steps to get there are clear and direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5eW5g"&gt;It’s also important to note that, despite the time looping premise, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a roguelike with randomized levels like &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; each area changes depending on the time of day, but otherwise it’s the same each time you visit. And while initially Colt can’t bring weapons or skills with him from one loop to the next, that changes when you’re able to harvest a material to infuse items so that they’ll carry over. This “residual energy” is called, obviously, residuum. This lets you steadily build out an arsenal over time, and grow more powerful by collecting “slabs” from downed visionaries that grant supernatural abilities like invisibility or teleportation. (The structure is almost like a modern day &lt;em&gt;Mega Man&lt;/em&gt;, with bosses that grant game-changing powers when you beat them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm5qy9"&gt;The game &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be repetitive at times. In one mission early on, for instance, I had to start up the same set of generators on three different days, in order to divert power to different areas of the island. For the most part, though, I was constantly doing different things. Missions involved everything from decrypting pictograms to infiltrating a masked ball. I also found that when I did have to revisit areas or scenarios, I usually either knew a shortcut to breeze past it or by that point was much more powerful, making it easier to take down whatever enemies I might need to kill. It’s also a very open game. With seven visionaries to kill and a big island to explore, there’s pretty much always something else to do if you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjB3M0OQlYNR5FO3gatAoOVsydE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846279/Deathloop_Shift_8637261279a70e6e756.01266203.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPU6Fx"&gt;That I’ve gone this far without even talking about the shooting should tell you something: &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;’s central mystery is such a fun and satisfying thing to pull apart and solve that it almost overshadows the action. That said, the action &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; amazing. This is clearly an Arkane game, which means it’s less a straight shooter, and more a game where you sneak into dangerous places and use a combination of stealth, creativity, and luck to kill everybody. I barely even used guns, instead relying primarily on my arsenal of superpowers and, more than anything else, a machete for quiet takedowns. (Kills in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; are extremely gory, with lots of decapitated heads and needlessly large splashes of blood.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xi5oWr"&gt;But, in true Arkane fashion, there always seemed to be multiple ways to tackle a problem, whether it was a different combat technique or a hidden passageway that sidestepped violence altogether. I should also note that on the PS5 the game makes great use of the DualSense controller, so combat really does feel better, thanks to realistic vibrations and different trigger tension depending on your weapon. The controller’s speaker, in particular, is put to good use, with Julianna constantly pestering you with messages over a walkie talkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wdMCrR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There always seemed to be multiple ways to tackle a problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0u0pT"&gt;I really only have a few small nitpicks with &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, and they mostly have to do with some artificial techniques the game uses to create tension. The first has to do with saves. Despite being a primarily single-player experience, you can’t save &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; mid-mission; instead, the game only saves when Colt leaves an area. Many of the missions are short, so it’s not always a problem, but some can drag on quite a bit, particularly when it comes to finally taking down the visionaries. It’s really frustrating to not be able to take a pause when real life interferes with playing the game. Likewise, &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; has an interesting take on multiplayer. While the story puts you in the role of Colt, you can also play as Julianna and wreak havoc on another player’s game. It’s a cool concept, but I mostly just found it annoying to be on a good run and have someone jump in and kill me in the middle of a carefully planned mission. It’s also unavoidable; if you aren’t playing online, an AI-powered Julianna will pop in on occasion instead. In my pre-launch experience, this always seemed to happen at the worst possible moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFk2T"&gt;The most remarkable thing about &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; is how all of its elements — the intricate, stylish world of Blackreef; action that encourages experimentation; a mystery dense with ideas and surprises; the entertainingly hostile relationship between Colt and Julianna — fit together so seamlessly. You could spend the morning tip-toeing around guards to find a password hidden in a desk, which helps you steal a sniper rifle in the afternoon, which you then use to take down a boss in the evening. And right after, Julianna is going to call you on a walkie for a charmingly expletive-laced tirade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Vf8rPT"&gt;Each of those elements feels not only cohesive, but necessary. In most games, audiologs are throwaway lore meant for the most hardcore fans. Here they can be the difference between success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiXkA"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Deathloop&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches September 14th on the PS5 and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla has defeated Microsoft’s default browser protections in Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eB1YMygh_06LyekrJ1bRao5-Rxo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850817/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rNf13a"&gt;Mozilla has quietly made it easier to switch to Firefox on Windows recently. While Microsoft offers a method to switch default browsers on Windows 10, it’s more cumbersome than the simple one-click process to switch to Edge. This one-click process isn’t officially available for anyone other than Microsoft, and Mozilla appears to have grown tired of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPp4AR"&gt;In version 91 of Firefox, released on August 10th, Mozilla has reverse engineered the way Microsoft sets Edge as default in Windows 10, and enabled Firefox to quickly make itself the default. Before this change, Firefox users would be sent to the Settings part of Windows 10 to then have to select Firefox as a default browser and ignore Microsoft’s plea to keep Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEe9w0"&gt;Mozilla’s reverse engineering means you can now set Firefox as the default from within the browser, and it does all the work in the background with no additional prompts. This circumvents Microsoft’s anti-hijacking protections that the company built into Windows 10 to ensure malware couldn’t hijack default apps. Microsoft tells us this is not supported in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BQwEzaE5oKefBcIRcLyaXqaqdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22846262/firefoxdefaults.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox now makes it easy to switch default browsers in Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7fs018"&gt;Mozilla has clearly grown tired of the more complicated way of setting up a default browser, a process that Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;making even harder in Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. “People should have the ability to simply and easily set defaults, but they don’t,” says a Mozilla spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “All operating systems should offer official developer support for default status so people can easily set their apps as default. Since that hasn’t happened on Windows 10 and 11, Firefox relies on other aspects of the Windows environment to give people an experience similar to what Windows provides to Edge when users choose Firefox to be their default browser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fk86j"&gt;Mozilla has been trying to convince Microsoft to improve its default browser settings in Windows since its &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/an-open-letter-to-microsofts-ceo-dont-roll-back-the-clock-on-choice-and-control/"&gt;open letter to Microsoft in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing has changed, and Windows 11 is now making it even harder to switch default browsers. That appears to be the final straw, as Mozilla began implementing its changes in Firefox shortly after the Windows 11 unveiling in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeQEyt"&gt;So far, Google, Vivaldi, Opera, and other Chromium-based browsers haven’t followed Mozilla’s lead, and it’s not clear exactly how Microsoft will respond. Microsoft has some genuine security-related reasons to protect against malware with anti-hijacking, but by allowing Edge to easily switch defaults it undermines rival browser vendors that simply want a level playing field. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;Windows 11 makes that playing field even more complicated&lt;/a&gt;, and competitors aren’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revolt of the delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flKHzgvqy1cP1wirFu1n6mqFfGM=/0x84:1359x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69850802/1921COV_MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 6:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez makes dinner deliveries during Hurricane Ida.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Exploited by apps. Attacked by thieves. Unprotected by police. The city’s 65,000 bikers have only themselves to count on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="UMAfkY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is a collaboration between &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/nyc-delivery-workers.html"&gt;New York&lt;em&gt; Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/los-repartidores-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lea el reportaje en español aquí.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NhJxKj"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwAGJd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Willis Avenue Bridge,&lt;/strong&gt; a 3,000-foot stretch of asphalt and beige-painted steel connecting Manhattan and the Bronx, is the perfect place for an ambush. The narrow bike path along its west side is poorly lit; darkened trash-strewn alcoves on either end are useful for lying in wait. All summer, food-delivery workers returning home after their shifts have been violently attacked there for their bikes: by gunmen pulling up on motorcycles, by knife-wielding thieves leaping from the recesses, by muggers blocking the path with Citi Bikes and brandishing broken bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EgwSyX"&gt;“Once you go onto that bridge, it’s another world,” one frequent crosser said. “You ever see wildlife with the wildebeest trying to cross with the crocodiles? That’s the crocodiles over there. We’re the wildebeests just trying to get by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqfDZW"&gt;Lately, delivery workers have found safety in numbers. On a humid July night, his last dinner orders complete, Cesar Solano, a lanky and serious 19-year-old from Guerrero, Mexico, rode his heavy electric bike onto the sidewalk at 125th Street and First Avenue and dismounted beneath an overpass. Across the street, through a lattice of on-ramps and off-ramps, was the entrance to the Willis, which threads under the exit of the RFK Bridge and over the Harlem River Drive before shooting out across the Harlem River. Whatever happens on the bridge is blocked from view by the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnLAgH"&gt;Several other workers had already arrived. The headlights of their parked bikes provided the only illumination. Cesar watched, his arms crossed, as his older cousin Sergio Solano and another worker strung a banner between the traffic light and a signpost on the corner. It read WE ARE ON GUARD TO PROTECT OUR DELIVERY WORKERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sZrwZ"&gt;Sergio walked back beneath the overpass, took up his megaphone, and whooped the siren, signaling to workers riding up First Avenue to wait and form a group before crossing. When five assembled, he announced the next departure for the Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bh547qLqPRQBMjnoNvcaRr3rBhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840800/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 31, 8:45 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Juan Solano makes deliveries in midtown during the dinner rush.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7Box9"&gt;Cesar, Sergio, and three other members of their family, all of whom work delivering food, had been standing watch each night for nearly a month. They live together nearby and heard about the attacks through the Facebook page they co-founded called El Diario de los Deliveryboys en la Gran Manzana, or “The Deliveryboys in the Big Apple Daily.” They started it in part to chronicle the bike thefts that have been plaguing workers on the bridge and elsewhere across the city. Sergio himself lost two bikes in two months. He reported both to the police, but the cases went nowhere, an experience common enough that many workers have concluded calling 911 is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWoN8E"&gt;Losing a bike is devastating for a delivery worker, obliterating several weeks’ worth of wages as well as the tool they need to earn those wages. “It’s my colleague,” Cesar said in Spanish through an interpreter. “It’s what takes me to work; it’s who I work with and what takes me home.” He’s customized his with dark-blue tape covering its frame, blue spokes, and color-changing LED light strips on its rear rack. Two Mexican flags fly from his front fork. He also attached a second battery since the main one lasts only seven hours, and he rides fast and for every app he can, typically working from breakfast to dinner. He maintains his bike with the help of a traveling mechanic known only as Su, who broadcasts his GPS location as he roams upper Manhattan. Recently, Cesar added a holster to his top bar for his five-pound steel U-lock so he can quickly draw it to defend himself in case of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davm3p"&gt;Even before the thefts started, the city’s 65,000 delivery workers had tolerated so much: the fluctuating pay, the lengthening routes, the relentless time pressure enforced by mercurial software, the deadly carelessness of drivers, the pouring rain and brutal heat, and the indignity of pissing behind a dumpster because the restaurant that depends on you refuses to let you use its restroom. And every day there were the trivially small items people ordered and the paltry tips they gave — all while calling you a hero and avoiding eye contact. Cesar recently biked from 77th on the Upper East Side 18 blocks south and over the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, then up through Long Island City and over another bridge to Roosevelt Island, all to deliver a single slice of cake for no tip at all. And now he had to worry about losing his bike, purchased with savings on his birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;September 1, 6:20 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez delivers an ice cream during Hurricane Ida.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9iN0Bm"&gt;For Cesar and many other delivery workers, the thefts broke something loose. Some started protesting and lobbying, partnering with nonprofits and city officials to propose legislation. Cesar and the Deliveryboys took another tack, forming a civil guard reminiscent of the one that patrolled San Juan Puerto Montaña, the small, mostly Indigenous Me’phaa village where they are from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHcA3R"&gt;That night, the space under the RFK overpass was a makeshift but welcoming way station. Aluminum catering trays of tacos and beans were arrayed beneath the trusses of the bridge. Arrivals never went long before being offered a plate and a Fanta. The parked bikes flashed festively. Some workers lingered only long enough for a quick fist bump before forming a convoy and departing. But a rotating crew of around a dozen stayed and chatted — sharing stories about who got in an accident and how they’re doing, how orders had slowed lately. Cesar, who hopes to be a video editor, livestreamed his nightly broadcast to the Deliveryboys page. It was something between a news bulletin and a pledge drive, with Cesar interviewing workers, thanking people for donating food, and shouting out to his viewers, who number in the thousands and tune in from Staten Island to their hometown in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXjZqg"&gt;Just before 1 a.m., a delivery worker rode up, his right arm bleeding. People rushed to him. The worker had been waiting, he explained, at a red light on 110th when someone leaped in front of him with a knife and demanded his bike. The worker accelerated but was slashed on the arm as he fled. Soon, a police cruiser arrived and later an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vavvq1"&gt;The worker, his blood pooling on the street, at first refused to be taken to the hospital. But the Deliveryboys convinced him to go. Sergio and Cesar shared their phone numbers and took his bike home when they left around 2 a.m. He retrieved it the next day before the Deliveryboys began their watch again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DS4GpL"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Uvcy7M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For years,&lt;/strong&gt; delivery workers in New York have improvised solutions like the bridge patrol to make their jobs feasible. These methods have been remarkably successful, undergirding the illusion of limitless and frictionless delivery. But every hack that made their working conditions tolerable only encouraged the apps and restaurants to ask more of them, until the job evolved into something uniquely intense, dangerous, and precarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrpEUL"&gt;Take the electric bike. When e-bikes first arrived in the city in the late 2000s, they were ridden mostly by older Chinese immigrants who used them to stay in the job as they aged, according to Do Lee, a Queens College professor who wrote his dissertation on delivery workers. But once restaurant owners and executives at companies like Uber, DoorDash, and Grubhub-Seamless figured out it was possible to do more and faster deliveries, they adjusted their expectations, and e-bikes became a de facto job requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDey6o"&gt;Today, delivery workers have an overwhelmingly preferred brand: the Arrow, essentially a rugged battery-powered mountain bike that tops out at around 28 miles per hour. A new Arrow runs $1,800 and can easily exceed $2,500 once it’s equipped with phone-charging mounts, lights, second batteries, air horns, racks, mud flaps, and other essential upgrades. What began as a technological assist has become a major start-up investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoM4RF"&gt;Delivery workers now move faster than just about anything else in the city. They keep pace with cars and weave between them when traffic slows, ever vigilant for opening taxi doors and merging trucks. They know they go too fast, any worker will say, but it’s a calculated risk. Slowing down means being punished by the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsiQwt"&gt;A few days after the Deliveryboys began their Willis guard, I met Anthony Chavez in front of a sleek glass apartment building near Lincoln Center. Chavez is something of an influencer among delivery workers, though his fame was inadvertent and the 26-year-old is too reserved to fully embrace the role. Wanting to share the tricks and texture of New York delivery, he started filming his work in late 2019 and posting the videos to a Facebook page he started called Chapín en Dos Ruedas, meaning “Guatemalan on Two Wheels.” Later, his posts about bike thefts would expand his audience to more than 12,000, but at first it was mostly just the six other Guatemalan delivery workers he lives with in the Bronx. Long stretches of his videos pass with little dialogue, just the background whine of his bike and the Dopplering traffic punctuated occasionally by his advice: Always wear a helmet, only listen to music with one earbud, avoid running red lights, and, if you must, really look both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nmd-dH_H3BZp8LNg4zQgpm1j7QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840801/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 25, 4:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Between the lunch and dinner shifts, delivery workers rest at an underground garage that serves as a makeshift break room.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AEvLtx"&gt;For about half his week, Chavez works at a rotisserie-chicken spot in midtown. He likes it there; the delivery radius is a bit over a mile, and the kitchen is good at batching orders. The restaurant pays him even when an accident takes him out of commission. He doesn’t even need his Arrow. Instead, he rides his pedal-powered Cannondale. An enthusiastic cyclist who rode BMXs back home and wears a small gold bike on his necklace, he likes cycling best about the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZvT3h"&gt;This used to be how delivery worked across the city. A restaurant that made delivery-friendly food like pizza or Chinese employed people to take it to customers in the neighborhood. Managers could be cruel, and owners frequently exploited a worker’s immigration status with illegally low wages, but the restaurant also provided shelter, restrooms, and often free meals and a place to eat them alongside co-workers. Unfortunately for Chavez, the chicken spot never has enough hours, so the rest of the time, he works for the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzOCVw"&gt;Before the apps, sites like Seamless and Grubhub simply listed restaurants that already offered delivery. But DoorDash, Postmates, and the other apps that arrived in the mid-2010s had their own delivery workers, armies of contractors directed by software on their phones. If a restaurant didn’t offer delivery or was too far away, the app just sent a gig worker to order takeout and bring it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMB790"&gt;The main reason restaurants weren’t already letting you order a single bacon, egg, and cheese from 50 blocks away for almost no charge is that it’s a terrible business model. Expensive, wasteful, labor intensive — you would lose money on every order. The apps promised to solve this problem through algorithmic optimization and scale. This has yet to happen — none of the companies are consistently profitable — but for a while they solved the problem with money. Armed with billions in venture capital, the apps subsidized what had been a low-margin side gig of the restaurant industry until it resembled any other Silicon Valley consumer-gratification machine. Seamless, which merged with Grubhub and added its own gig platform to compete, was particularly direct in its pitch, running cutesy subway ads about ordering delivery with zero human contact and requesting miniature entrées for your hamster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ChCmly"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They obey the bespoke instructions that pop up on their screens:  Don’t wait outside Benny’s Burritos, don’t ask to use the restroom, be “super nice!” to Dig Inn because it is a “VIP  client” — or have your account suspended.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0yhC2"&gt;The apps failed and bought each other, and now three giants remain: DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub-Seamless. Each divides the New York market more or less equally, and each uses the piecework model pioneered by Uber itself. Workers get paid when they accept and complete a delivery, and a gamelike system of rewards and penalties keeps them moving: high scores for being on time, low scores and fewer orders for tardiness, and so on. Chavez and others call it the &lt;em&gt;patrón fantasma,&lt;/em&gt; the phantom boss — always watching and quick to punish you for being late but nowhere to be found when you need $10 to fix your bike or when you get doored and have to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpfSCb"&gt;Then there is a fourth app, which Chavez and thousands of others work for but few customers have heard of, called Relay Delivery. It’s a privately held company founded in 2014 and mostly limited to New York. The best way to understand Relay is to think of most delivery apps as two different businesses: the lucrative digital one that customers order from and that charges restaurants commission and advertising fees, and the labor-intensive, logistically complicated — “crummy,” in the words of Grubhub’s founder — business of getting the food to the customer. Relay handles just the second one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPPkn2"&gt;Restaurants can outsource all their delivery to Relay, no matter if the customer ordered on Seamless or DoorDash or called direct. When the food is ready, the restaurant uses the Relay app to summon a worker who is supposed to appear in under five minutes. It’s often cheaper for restaurants than the other apps, and it’s extremely reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LaHY"&gt;This is in part because the rewards Relay offers workers are greater and its penalties more severe. Rather than piecework, it pays $12.50 per hour plus tips. But unlike Uber and DoorDash, workers can deliver food only if they’re scheduled, and the schedule is designed through daily zero-sum competition, with the best-rated workers getting first dibs. If you get an early enough sign-up time to grab the Upper West Side from 5 to 9 p.m., you can rest easy knowing you’ll have a decently paying job tomorrow. But if you rejected a delivery, or went too slow, or weren’t in your designated zone the second your shift started (even if that was because you were delivering a Relay order from your prior shift), or committed any other mysterious infraction, your sign-up time moves back 20 minutes. Maybe all that’s left is Hoboken from 2 to 4 p.m. Worse, maybe there’s nothing and you’re relegated to &lt;em&gt;picoteo, &lt;/em&gt;or “pecking.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtSngIiXP1dhbiuRP2Eu8coSpuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840806/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 5 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez with the batteries for the electric bikes that must be changed every six hours. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EWUOly"&gt;You see them around the city, sitting on benches jabbing their screens, refreshing the schedule on the off chance some unlucky colleague had to cancel. It’s a fate terrifying enough that when one worker hit a storm drain, flew from his bike, and suffered a concussion so severe he was passing in and out of consciousness and had to be taken to the hospital, he still made sure to have a friend message the company explaining why he wasn’t accepting orders. Later, trying to get his score up, he volunteered to work during Hurricane Ida, wrecked his bike, and got bumped from the schedule entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BQDba"&gt;So while DoorDash and Uber workers have some leeway to pick which deliveries they take, as a practical matter, Relay workers accept every order assigned to them. They obey the bespoke instructions that pop up on their screens: Don’t wait outside Benny’s Burritos, don’t ask to use the restroom, be “super nice!” to Dig Inn because it is a “VIP client” — or have your account suspended. Above all, they try to maintain the ideal pace of a delivery every 15 minutes, no matter the delivery distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LO9cQT"&gt;If these sound more like the demands placed on an actual employee as opposed to an ostensibly free independent contractor, many class-action plaintiffs have agreed. The company has been sued multiple times for worker misclassification, tip theft, and other infractions. It settled three times, avoiding a ruling that could torpedo its business model, and another case is currently in arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTIC8G"&gt;A spokesperson said the company has implemented a fix to prevent restaurants from unilaterally expanding their delivery zones, but it currently only works for new entrants to the platform. The tip theft that workers often complain of occurs when restaurants receive an order, then enter the wrong tip information into the Relay app, the spokesperson said, and the company has added a way for workers to dispute this. As for the intense pressure, the company said that it matches the number of riders each day with anticipated demand but that there is a large backlog of people who want to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQ5pm7"&gt;That’s true. Many would rather work for a restaurant, but when forced to pick among the apps, Chavez, Cesar, and others choose Relay, which they say pays better and more consistently than its piecework peers. It is, after all, the closest among them to a traditional job. But all the apps have this in common: The physical practicalities of maintaining the modern buffet of speedy delivery options fall to the workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="0oXONW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgmC-OWnk_M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICCsYj"&gt;I followed Chavez down the ramp of the glass tower’s parking garage and around the corner to where delivery workers have set up a subterranean base. Electric bikes were parked in front of plywood shelving crammed with charging batteries, their lights blinking red and green. Under the garage ramp, five workers sat on a pipe eating lunch beneath a harsh fluorescent light, clothes hung to dry on another pipe above their heads. About a dozen people sat on folding chairs around a long table, eating from Styrofoam takeout trays and playing with their phones. Others napped in the carriages of bike rickshaws draped with plastic flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTTFfv"&gt;Garages like these are scattered across the city, a solution worked out to replace some of the necessities once supplied by restaurants. Another option for shelter, particularly in the winter, is to get a Chase debit card and take refuge in the lobbies of the bank’s ubiquitous branches, warming yourself with a coffee before you’re told to move on. But the coffee raises another pressing question: where to find a restroom. The garage solves both problems and others, like bike storage and battery charging. Now, instead of shift meals during the predinner lull, workers take turns ordering delivery and eat underground. (They always tip well.) Chavez pays $120 a month for his spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DX0yc"&gt;Every adaptation has a cost, the Arrow being by far the largest. The appeal of the Arrow is the network of shops that sell it. They sell only Arrows, and if you have one, they will do simple repairs for cheap or free. The shops also charge second batteries for a monthly fee. The city’s pocked streets are rough on the bikes, and each evening just before the dinner rush, delivery workers wait outside Arrow stores as mechanics strip and rewire water-damaged controllers and replace bald tires with the fluid focus of a NASCAR pit crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSHLmo"&gt;Bikes, cold-weather gear, garages, maintenance: The costs add up. Workers even pay for their own app-branded cooler bags. So while DoorDash claims Manhattan workers make $33 per hour, including tips, when you factor in expenses, delivery workers have a base pay of $7.87 per hour, according to a recent study of app-based workers conducted by the Cornell Worker Institute and the Worker’s Justice Project. Neither estimate includes time spent waiting between deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQkA2TlX4gaL98hPPhjDF4Oiirc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840799/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 27, 6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; At a garage on the West Side of Manhattan, bikers charge batteries for their electric bikes ahead of the dinner shift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeJhMv"&gt;Workers developed the whole system — the bikes, repair networks, shelters, charging stations — because they had to. To the apps, they are independent contractors; to restaurants, they are emissaries of the apps; to customers, they represent the restaurants. In reality, the workers are on their own, often without even the minimum in government support. As contractors and, often, undocumented immigrants, they have few protections and virtually no safety net. The few times city authorities noted the delivery worker’s changing role, it was typically with confused hostility. Until recently, throttle-powered electric bikes like the Arrow were illegal to ride, though not to own. Mayor de Blasio heightened enforcement in 2017, calling the bikes “a real danger” after an Upper West Side investment banker clocked workers with a speed gun and complained to him on &lt;em&gt;The Brian Lehrer Show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqstNx"&gt;The NYPD set up checkpoints, fining riders $500, seizing their bikes, and posting photos of the busts on Twitter. The police would then return the bikes because, again, they were legal to own. It was a costly and bewildering ritual. For years, bike activists and workers pushed for legalization, though the apps that benefited from them were largely silent. It was only when another group of tech companies — hoping to make scooter-sharing legal — joined the fight that a bill moved forward in Albany. Then the pandemic hit, restaurants were restricted to takeout, and the mayor had to acknowledge that the bikes were an essential part of the city’s delivery infrastructure. He halted enforcement. The bikes were officially legalized three months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iu4a0"&gt;Maybe it was legalization that triggered the robberies. Maybe it was the pandemic-emptied streets. Maybe it was all the people out of work who needed money, or all the other people out of work who were enlisting to serve the newly formed Zoom class and suddenly needed e-bikes. Everyone has a theory. But what happened next is a familiar story. The workers turned to the city for help, got none, and started figuring out a solution themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pCw5wl"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rwYWaj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chavez has no history&lt;/strong&gt; of activism and no interest in being a leader. Those things take time, and he came to the city with a plan: work hard for five years and save enough money to buy a house in Guatemala City. Many workers treat the job like a dangerous but temporary trial they hope will give them a shot at pulling themselves out of poverty back home. Cesar has a plan too: work until he can buy a house for his parents and himself, then return. Things don’t always go according to plan. You meet someone here and start a family. You discover that all the money you thought you were saving has gone to bikes and food and rent. The city becomes familiar. Years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJuhhW"&gt;That was the case for Eliseo Tohom, Chavez’s 36-year-old roommate. He’s been working delivery for 14 years. Chavez teases him on his livestreams. “That Eliseo is well known around these streets,” he said when Tohom chimed in on the chat. “Single ladies, delivery worker Eliseo is looking for a girl to take back to Guatemala.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aqkzb"&gt;Last October, the two were eating pizza in Central Park and talking about the robberies. A fellow garage member, 17 years old, had been unlocking his bike after depositing a dinner on Riverside Drive when two men tackled him from behind. A third grabbed his bike and rode off as the other assailants leaped into a waiting car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LpwG0Wn5x5v5McZXvIObDKZ521o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840802/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 27, 6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Anthony Chavez preparing to head out for the dinner shift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2aHPW"&gt;It was the second such attack to befall a garage member and one of countless they had heard about. According to NYPD data, robberies and attempted robberies of delivery workers increased 65 percent in 2020, to 332, and are on track to exceed that number this year. But those are only the small fraction of cases that are reported to the police. Workers say officers often discouraged them from filing reports and showed so little progress solving the thefts they did report that many stopped bothering to do so. In contrast to the NYPD’s numbers, the Worker’s Justice Project’s survey found that 54 percent of the city’s delivery workers have had their bikes stolen. About 30 percent of those thefts were violent. The group said it receives approximately 50 reports of thefts and robberies a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIjSyo"&gt;Tohom had put together a pool to buy the kid a new bike, but he wanted to do more. He proposed going to the local precinct, maybe with a dozen or so people from their garage and another group in midtown, and asking the police to do something. Chavez posted the announcement on Chapín.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSfvQf"&gt;About 30 people showed up to the park at 72nd and Amsterdam and rode honking to the precinct. There, they blocked the street, shouting “No more robberies!” to nonplussed cops. Eventually, a Spanish-speaking officer came out. Tohom stepped forward and listed robbery after robbery — Monday at 150 Central Park, yesterday at 100th, another at 67th, knives, guns, machetes, thefts they reported months ago and received no response about, bikes stolen with GPS that police refused to pursue — as the crowd yelled “Help us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Z8dSp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bikes, maintenance, shelters, charging stations, cooler bags — when you factor those in, delivery workers take home a base pay of $7.87 per hour.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xggwp7"&gt;Chavez posted a video of the scene, and it ricocheted through New York’s delivery community. Overnight, he gained 1,000 followers. The next day, a representative got in touch from the Worker’s Justice Project, which had previously supported construction workers and domestic laborers and had started organizing delivery workers during the pandemic. WJP helped file the paperwork for a more formal rally the following week. Again, Chavez announced it on his Facebook page. This time, hundreds showed up. Chavez livestreamed as the armada rode honking down Broadway, flags waving from their bikes, to City Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhYxcW"&gt;It was the first time so many delivery workers had gathered in one place, and it sparked an explosion of new groups. It was there that Cesar met Chavez. Soon after, he and his cousins and uncles launched the Deliveryboys page. Like Chavez’s page, it soon became a hub for theft alerts, but it was also a place to memorialize slain and injured workers. When the DoorDash worker Francisco Villalva Vitinio was shot and killed for his bike in March, the Deliveryboys posted videos of vigils in New York and of Villalva Vitinio’s casket being carried down the streets of his hometown in Guerrero, Mexico. Later they broadcast live from the precinct on the day the suspect was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02kE2z"&gt;Small cadres of workers had already begun forming groups on WhatsApp and Telegram to share information and protect one another. But now they built more formal and larger versions with names like Delivery Worker Alerts, Emergency Group, and Robbery Alerts in the Big Apple. At the protest, workers scanned QR codes on one another’s phones to join. Approximate territories took shape, with groups for the Upper West Side, Astoria, and lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tkqwD"&gt;“There are thousands of delivery workers on the streets, and if we are all connected, we can see the thieves and act ourselves,” Chavez later told his viewers as he rode. Join a group, he said. Buy a GPS and hide it on your bike; that way, when it gets stolen, you can track it down and call on your fellow workers for help. If the police wouldn’t get their bikes back, maybe they could do it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="h3O3EI"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Yu94h7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was Gustavo Ajche,&lt;/strong&gt; a 38-year-old construction worker and part-time DoorDasher, who contacted Chavez’s group after the impromptu precinct rally and helped get permits for the larger one. Even then, he was pushing the group to think bigger. Chavez and Tohom wanted to march to Columbus Circle; Ajche said the thefts were affecting everyone, so they should march all the way to City Hall. He also wanted them to think beyond the robberies, to regulations and durable improvements to working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnYD4D"&gt;I met Ajche at 60 Wall Street, a gaudy ’80s atrium decorated with palm trees and columns that is a frequent hangout for delivery workers in the Financial District. The nearby parking garage where Ajche stores his bike isn’t as nice as Chavez’s, he explained, on account of leaks and rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bYf6z"&gt;There were about a dozen Arrows parked outside, all with stickers bearing the red-and-black fist-raised deliveryman logo of Los Deliveristas Unidos, an arm of the Worker’s Justice Project that Ajche helped start. An animated speaker with an open face, Ajche is an effective organizer, and he’s eager to grow the movement. Taking out his phone, he showed me a new Deliveristas logo written in Bengali — part of the group’s effort to expand beyond Spanish-speaking workers. He would soon make versions in Mandarin and French. I noted the green gear-eyed skull logo on the back of his phone case, the symbol of Aztecas en dos Ruedas (“Aztecs on Two Wheels”), a fixie-riding, alley-cat-racing club of delivery workers. “They are my friends; they are with us,” he said by way of explanation. A worker, still helmeted, pushed through the turnstile door and waved to Ajche before joining a group seated on the other side of the hall — Ajche’s friends too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyhmSn"&gt;After the success of the October march, the Deliveristas planned an even larger rally for April. This time, thousands gathered and rode honking to City Hall, where they were joined by representatives from SEIU 32BJ, the powerful union that backed the Fight for $15. City Councilmember Brad Lander, then running for city comptroller, and State Senator Jessica Ramos spoke. Later, the City Council introduced a package of bills crafted in discussion with the Deliveristas that would establish minimum pay and give workers more control over their routes, among other changes (it will likely be voted on this month). In June, the Deliveristas helped kill a bill pushed by Uber and Lyft that would have allowed gig workers to unionize while falling short of offering them full employment rights.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 27, 9:20 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Delivery workers store their bikes at a garage overnight and prepare to take the subway home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt9A4r"&gt;Some of the apps also began discussions with the Deliveristas. DoorDash announced that nearly 200 (out of 18,000) of its restaurants would let delivery workers use their restrooms and that the company is working on an emergency-assistance button for its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7USgrR"&gt;Ajche is far from appeased. He recalled a Zoom meeting in which DoorDash put forward a “top Dasher” to tell them how great working for DoorDash was. Ajche silenced him by saying that he can bring 500 people with complaints. “They are afraid of us,” he said. “They think we are trying to unionize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpOOHr"&gt;Later in June, around the time when Cesar and the Deliveryboys were beginning their watch at the Willis Avenue Bridge, Ajche and other Deliveristas met with the NYPD chief of department, Rodney Harrison, who agreed to appoint an officer to act as a liaison with the workers and to increase security on the bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbJNzD"&gt;Progress is slow. The NYPD said it encourages people to register their bikes with the department and to call 911 if their bike is stolen. But the department is a sprawling organization with tremendous inertia and little understanding of what modern delivery work entails. “What we’ve been doing is conquering precinct by precinct,” said Hildalyn Colón Hernández, whom the WJP brought on to handle police relations and policy. Colón Hernández, who previously worked on a construction-fraud task force in the Manhattan DA’s office, recalled a recent exchange in which she was pushing an officer to investigate a stolen bike and he said, essentially, “What’s the big deal? It’s just a bike.” Colón Hernández launched into an explanation: First off, it’s their tool; they lose that tool, they don’t work tomorrow. Second, it probably cost around $3,000. “That patrol officer looked at me very differently,” she said. “They were like, ‘Wait a minute. This is a grand larceny?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r68GZw"&gt;She has been having conversations like that across the city’s bureaucracy. Take the Willis Avenue Bridge. First, she had to talk to the precincts on either side of the bridge because the city splits jurisdiction down the middle. Then came the cameras, which workers complained were broken, because despite the NYPD sign saying the bridge was under 24-hour surveillance, whenever they went to the police asking for footage of their assaults, they were told none existed. But the cameras worked just fine; it’s just that they were pointed at the cars, not the bike path. To change that, Colón Hernández will need to track down someone in the Department of Transportation and explain why it’s urgently important that they shift the traffic cameras on a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQycH_Av2lDZB4u6K1OAG5Z2nt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840807/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 11 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Cesar Solano at Willis Avenue Bridge on his birthday at the end of his work day.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YkBRB"&gt;Chavez and the Deliveryboys rarely attend these meetings. They stress their independence and express skepticism that anyone — police, city officials, sometimes even the Deliveristas — will ever help them. Chavez sees himself as just a guy with a Facebook page. Juan Solano, Cesar’s uncle and the most outspoken of the Deliveryboys, sees a distinction between “politics,” which are futile, and what they are doing, which is “organizing our people” to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3e0Xw5"&gt;Ajche understands the wariness. “In our countries, organizations show up, promise to do stuff, and never deliver,” he said. It’s not like they’ve gotten much help from institutions here, either. Yet he is palpably frustrated at the resistance. “A change of mind would be good for them. They have potential; they’ve done things. But they reached a point where they can’t do much more since they’re not in touch with politicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBz2Wl"&gt;Ajche pointed out that earlier this year, the Deliveryboys told their followers to barrage the Relay app with a cut-and-paste indictment of the company’s rating system, long routes, and vanishing tips. “Us delivery workers are tired of so much injustice,” they wrote, threatening to “stop working without prior notice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQCRxj"&gt;“It’s the same thing that we are trying to do!” Ajche said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbM8pG"&gt;Not long after the walkout threat, Relay added a DISPUTE TIP button. It was a victory, but a partial one. Making use of the feature requires workers to know the actual amount a customer tipped, and many lack the language skills to ask. Juan is thinking about making cards in English so they can show customers why they need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tJtxNo"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rF8fUF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared to&lt;/strong&gt; the grinding progress of New York’s bureaucracy, when it comes to thefts, self-defense yields immediate results: a bike recovered, a thief apprehended, a bridge defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpQAj0"&gt;Chavez advises workers to keep a photo of their bike on their phone. If it’s stolen, send the photo to the group, and often another worker will soon spot someone selling it on the street. The spotter sends the location, then pretends to be an interested buyer — “Hey, buddy, how much you want for that?” — until reinforcements arrive and unobtrusively encircle the two hagglers before closing in. Ideally, surrounded by a dozen delivery workers, the suspect gives up peacefully and returns the bike to its rightful owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFj42L"&gt;But not always. In June, a Lower East Side group saw someone selling a stolen bike on Lafayette, but the suspect hopped on the bike and fled. The group gave chase for several blocks before tackling him on Delancey. At that point, the police took notice and detained the suspect. When the bike’s owner arrived, he ceremoniously inserted his key into the lock, dangling from the frame, and opened it to cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQ4Svf"&gt;Two weeks later, a Relay worker named Angel Lopez was cruising up Amsterdam with a dinner from Celeste when he noticed someone sawing through a bike lock with a power grinder, throwing up sparks. He stopped, shocked. While he was debating what to do, workers from a nearby Chinese takeout place rushed out, grabbed chairs from their outdoor-dining setup, and started hitting the thief, who responded by brandishing his buzz saw. A standoff ensued until the thief, deterred, jogged off. Lopez sent an alert to his group, Upper Furious, and followed from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMvesY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I let him go, he’s just gonna get away, just like every other guy, &lt;/em&gt;he thought. Lopez crossed paths with two other workers and told them what was happening. They joined in cautious pursuit. Periodically, the thief looked back and yelled, “Keep following me. I got something for you,” Lopez said, and they wondered what that could mean, whether he could have a gun in his backpack and be luring them to a less crowded part of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaFoRm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYs3XO3V7N2qyVdfVEJVqVN-tjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840809/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 11:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Bikers wait for a bigger group to form before crossing the Willis Avenue Bridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mjIENc"&gt;The man stopped at another locked bike and began again with the buzz saw, threatening the workers whenever they got close. “That thing will cut your face off,” Lopez recalled. The bike freed, the thief started to pedal away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjRE0a"&gt;There were now about ten workers, and they chased the thief, trying to shove him off his bike as he attempted to strike them with his saw. Lopez said they passed a cop car and shouted for help, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ud1kXZ"&gt;They hit the downward slope toward Riverside Park, and a few workers gunned their bikes forward to head off the thief. Surrounded, he got off the bike and swung the saw, then hurled the cut lock at the gathered crowd. But in throwing the lock, he lost his grip on the saw, and it fell to the ground. It was at that moment that police arrived, pushed through the workers, and pinned the suspect to the ground with, Lopez said, a degree of force he felt ambivalent about. “It got to the point where he said, ‘I can’t breathe’ — you know those famous lines,” he recalled. A few workers shouted that he deserved it. “You could feel the anger in the air,” Lopez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYmRm7"&gt;He couldn’t stay to talk to the cops. He was 30 minutes late with his order and worried Relay would deactivate him. “You’re no superhero,” he imagined the company telling him. “Just deliver the food.” The suspect was charged with attempted robbery, possession of a weapon, petit larceny, and resisting arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nlRk9S"&gt;These ad hoc sting operations worry Colón Hernández. She believes that some of the thieves are organized, possibly transporting the bikes out of state. They are often armed. Workers have been stabbed and attacked with fireworks when they tried to recover their bikes themselves. Chasing down and apprehending every thief in the city is both unsustainable and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRqsxD"&gt;“The first time works. The second time may work. What happens when the third time, somebody gets killed? Or you hurt somebody because you’re chasing people at a very fast pace?” she said. “I’ve been saying this to the NYPD: One day I’m going to get a call that I don’t want to get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jq8BPC"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6gNW0X"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a Friday night&lt;/strong&gt; in July, Nicolas was coming back outside after dropping off a pizza near Madison Square Park when he saw that his bike had vanished. &lt;em&gt;What am I going to do? &lt;/em&gt;he thought. &lt;em&gt;How am I going to work?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njrTXQ"&gt;Originally from Puebla, Mexico, Nicolas, 42 (who, fearing retaliation from the thief, requested a pseudonym), worked to send money home to his four children, whom he hadn’t seen since he crossed the border 12 years ago. The more he worked, the sooner he could return, and he worked a lot: a 5 a.m. cleaning shift at a pizza place, then delivering either for the restaurant or for DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbnCEZ"&gt;He called his brother, another delivery worker, and asked him to post a photo of his bike to the Deliveryboys’ WhatsApp. An hour later, he got a hit: Someone had spotted his bike, a teal-taped Arrow, being wheeled into an apartment building in the Bronx. The tipster had followed the man, filmed him, and noted the address. Nicolas got on the train and headed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDNjMT"&gt;He was met by five other workers from the WhatsApp group who’d come to help. Standing in front of the building, Nicolas called 911 and was told to wait for a patrol car, so they waited. And waited. After midnight, he thanked the others for standing by him and told them to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeSPjQ"&gt;Three days later, after he’d given the bike up for lost, one of the workers who had stood with him Friday flagged him down. Another bike had been stolen and traced to the same building. A group was gathering to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tZWN4"&gt;When the two arrived, they encountered 15 or so workers standing in front of the building. Cesar was there along with a contingent that had caravanned from the Willis Avenue Bridge. Chavez was there too. Nicolas introduced himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tO6sac"&gt;Cesar and Chavez had been called there by the owner of the other bike, Margaro Solano. Unlike Nicolas’s bike, Margaro’s had a GPS. Seeing his bike had been taken to the Bronx, he and his wife — who left her restaurant job to help — had immediately headed there. They confirmed they had the right place by obtaining building surveillance footage of a man — the same one filmed carrying Nicolas’s bike — lugging Margaro’s up the stairs and into his apartment. They could hear Margaro’s bike alarm blaring through the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZAClcdiv0YMu2l_ClXTOAwfZSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840805/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;August 30, 11:30 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; A delivery worker at the Willis Avenue Bridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rXbGjI"&gt;After Margaro was unable to get help from the nearby precinct, he called Chavez, who texted Cesar, who put out a call on WhatsApp. By the time Nicolas arrived, the group had gone back to the precinct, failed to get help, and settled in for a stakeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NFRIK"&gt;Rather than risk a confrontation inside the building, Chavez and the others decided the safest approach would be to wait for the thief to emerge and ask for the bikes back. Two workers stood just outside the building entrance, while another loitered in the lobby. The rest gathered on the sidewalk outside, chatting. The stakeout was the first time most of them had met in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdFIEA"&gt;Around midnight, conversation began to shift to how late it was and when they should decide to call it a night. Many had come directly from work, skipping dinner. Then he emerged, the man from the videos. The workers on the street watched as he opened the lobby door and stepped outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOzqX2"&gt;The group followed him for a block, tailing him as stealthily as a dozen deliverymen on electric bikes could manage. After a second block, they descended, surrounding him on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faTgVa"&gt;For vigilante justice, it was a restrained confrontation. No one touched anyone else. The workers, masked, stood back in a circle and asked for their bikes to be returned; the man towered over them by at least two heads. Chavez was filming, Cesar broadcasting live. Nicolas stood at the margins, watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbmDC3"&gt;To Cesar’s surprise, the man asked how many bikes they had come for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xU2OPT"&gt;Two, he answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY6EJr"&gt;When the thief asked for $1,000 to give them back, the workers started shouting. “Show him! Let him see!” they yelled in Spanish. “The camera was watching you!” in English. Chavez said they didn’t want trouble and wouldn’t call the police if the man just gave back the bikes — a bluff. Chavez knew the police wouldn’t come. The man didn’t budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LL5T7ts3VosqNhbDGUvOGfPdjcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840808/MontgomeryNYMAG_Deliveristas_Final_011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;September 4, 6 P.M.&lt;/strong&gt; Juan Solano at home in the two-bedroom apartment he shares with five other delivery bikers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81j0Q3"&gt;A worker held out his phone to the suspect, showing him the surveillance video. He watched footage of himself carrying the bike up the stairs. Then he watched it again. He paused, thought it over, and agreed to return the bikes. The group formed an escort down Grand Concourse, the suspect surrounded by workers on foot who were circled by bikers cruising slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plG08g"&gt;Chaos ensued once they entered the building. An acquaintance of the man blocked the workers in the entryway while attempting to assure them he would bring their bikes down. Unconvinced, they pushed forward until everyone — the two men, followed by Cesar, Chavez, Nicolas, Margaro, and several others — started running up the stairs. As they neared the fifth floor, they could hear the bike’s shrill alarm. Nicolas was too thrilled at the prospect of being reunited with his bike to be scared. One man held the workers at bay while the other brought out Margaro’s bike, lights flashing, and then Nicolas’s. Cesar glimpsed two other bikes inside before the men shut the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkRtWF"&gt;“Thank you!” a worker shouted in English as the group shuffled the bikes down the stairs. “Let’s go! Two bikes — we came to get one, left with two,” he continued in Spanish. “Let’s go tell the precinct we actually could get it. Police don’t know how to do their job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRkxHD"&gt;Cesar was bringing up the rear and still streaming when someone grabbed him from behind. In the video, the suspect’s acquaintance can be heard shouting that he should be rewarded for helping them. Cesar elbowed his assailant and broke free, dashing down the stairs to join the others in front of the building. They mounted their bikes and sped away, riding down the bike lane together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuSWzl"&gt;The next day, Chavez would tell Colón Hernández what had happened and send her the evidence they’d gathered. She’d watch the video of the raid with dismay — reckless, dangerous, no plan at all — and then work the system her way. She’d finish the process of filing Nicolas’s police report and stay on the detectives. She’d involve the new delivery liaison. Three weeks after the bikes were recovered, the suspect would be arrested and charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9ANuz"&gt;But the workers didn’t know any of that that night. In fact, they wouldn’t hear about the arrest until I told them. The night they got the bikes back, they had little reason to believe justice would be served. It was their own detective work that had succeeded when the system failed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BORn4v"&gt;After they rode some distance from the building, Chavez filmed a news broadcast outside a bodega. It was a mix of anger and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP37X0"&gt;“The police did nothing,” Chavez narrated as Nicolas held up the paperwork he’d been given by a precinct days before. “We had agreed with them that they would be there for us whenever a bike got stolen, and they weren’t. Don’t commit then. We organize. We recover our bicycles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SuxJIh"&gt;They didn’t linger to celebrate their victory. It was late, and they had work in the morning. Nicolas’s predawn shift would begin in just four hours. He hopped back on his bike and sped home to get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
