    <title>Nintendo’s latest Pokémon remakes are perfectly fine versions of great games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4vstpPi_Pq0Vn3SRwe8DKIQQww=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154231/BDSP_Screenshot_32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bcIE68"&gt;The past week or so has shown just how challenging the concept of a remake or remaster can be, whether we’re talking about games or TV shows. The remastered &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, for instance, seemed like a slam dunk but has instead turned into a meme factory. Netflix’s take on &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, has had to thread a tricky needle of remaining true to the anime while also standing on its own. So, while it may seem like faint praise, it’s important to say this about Nintendo’s latest &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; releases, which bring the classic &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;to the Switch: they’re perfectly acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOIvTn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shining Pearl&lt;/em&gt;, as they’re called, are slightly upgraded versions of the games that first graced the Nintendo DS in 2006. The new versions follow the same simple story — you’re a budding pokémon trainer who ends up having to thwart a mysterious organization known as Team Galactic — in the beautiful Sinnoh region. You once again start out by choosing between a penguin, fire monkey, and a turtle with a twig growing out of its head. When they first came out, &lt;em&gt;Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl &lt;/em&gt;really tested just how far the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; formula could stretch. They didn’t add all that much, and the story wasn’t particularly memorable, and yet… I couldn’t stop playing. What they lacked in originality the games made up for with a rock-solid adventure and lots of cool creatures to collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oJQOy"&gt;This all remains true with the remakes. I’ve played through the first few hours of &lt;em&gt;Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels a lot like what I remember from the DS days. The most notable difference, of course, is how the game looks. Things are fully 3D, but instead of following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"&gt;the Switch games &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these remakes introduce a new chibi art style reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13457446/world-of-final-fantasy-game-rpg-ps4-vita"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUfstLb8ME17yVs_uZsESKEQOwo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23020132/Pokemon_Brilliant_Diamond_and_Shining_Pearl___Screenshot_17.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rpf3lZ"&gt;One the one hand, the graphics actually feel pretty true to the originals; characters have big heads and teeny tiny bodies while running around the field, and then inexplicably are perfectly proportioned once you hop into battle. But it’s also a bit of an acquired taste. Personally I’m not all that into the super-deformed character designs, and there are some other visual quirks, like flat textures and strangely shiny floors inside just about every building. It looks alright in handheld mode, though I found it pretty ugly blown up on a television set. I was also struck by how small the towns and routes felt compared to more recent entries. But hey, at least the pokémon look normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDqH1x"&gt;If the visuals don’t bother you, the good news is that gameplay-wise this remake is great — and that’s because it changes very little from the original. If you’ve become bored by the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; formula over the years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698264/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-nintendo-switch"&gt;you should probably wait for next year’s &lt;em&gt;Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looks to introduce something of an open world to the series. But if the standard &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; structure is still enough to excite you, there are few better options. The game even adds a few more modern quality-of-life improvements, most notably having EXP share — an item that lets all of the pokémon in your party, not just the one battling, earn experience — as a built-in feature from the get-go. This massively reduces the tedium of building a team and makes things like evolving a Magikarp into a less frustrating experience. There’s also an improved smartwatch that lets you use moves like Cut — necessary for bypassing certain obstacles — without having to teach them to a pokémon, which was always a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unAfcq"&gt;In a world where remakes, remasters, and reboots are both ubiquitous and often quite bad, it’s nice to have a game that doesn’t mess with things too much. Sure, I could’ve done with a different visual style. But there’s something really comforting about slipping back into a familiar experience and losing a few hours to the pleasant routine of catching them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KlYN0"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Shining Pearl&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launch on the Nintendo Switch on November 19th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tidal launches free streaming and splits HiFi into two plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4_EgE-Rse6V8lBcVzt-nuFxGEM=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154162/tidal.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tidal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JYK8xi"&gt;Tidal is making some significant changes to its subscription plans and introducing a free, ad-sponsored tier for the first time. The new Tidal Free plan launches today, is exclusive to the US, and the company says it offers “access to our entire music catalog and playlists, with limited interruptions.” Streaming quality tops out at 160kbps, however, so it’s not much for Tidal’s paid options on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGUnaR"&gt;As for those paid subscriptions, Tidal is upgrading its standard paid plan to include lossless and high-resolution audio. Now known as Tidal HiFi, the $9.99-per-month tier offers the improved music quality (up to 1411kbps) and also adds “offline capabilities, access to features like Tidal Connect and My Activity, which provides individualized daily listening insights.” With Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited now offering lossless at no extra cost, Tidal had little choice here but to match those services. The service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;now owned by Square&lt;/a&gt;, was among the first to make a big lossless push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9J1tu"&gt;But the company is also adding a new, third plan called Tidal HiFi Plus. It costs $19.99 monthly and will be home to Tidal’s most premium audio content. You’ll need HiFi Plus for “best-in-class immersive sound formats” including Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Audio tracks. Tidal’s Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) recordings are also reserved exclusively for the higher HiFi tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lrxHv"&gt;Separate from its consumer-facing news, Tidal is announcing some new initiatives it hopes could provide artists with some additional revenue from the fractions of scraps they normally receive from music streaming services. Here’s what those will entail, according to the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JQbhGG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct-to-artist payments:&lt;/strong&gt; Beginning today, TIDAL will launch monthly direct-to-artist payments. This innovative program will give artists access to an additional payment stream, so they can benefit directly from their biggest fans on TIDAL. Each month, a percentage of HiFi Plus subscribers’ membership fees will be directed towards their top streamed artist, which they will see in their activity feed. This direct-to-artist payment is in addition to their streaming royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8aabG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fan-centered royalties:&lt;/strong&gt; Starting in 2022, TIDAL is taking a different approach on royalties. In this new model, royalties attributed to HiFi Plus subscribers will not be aggregated. Rather, royalties will be paid based on the actual streaming activity of individual HiFi Plus subscribers as opposed to the industry accepted method of aggregating streams, empowering fans to play a larger role in the success of their favorite artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PlqaYh"&gt;These new efforts sound promising in concept and definitely shake things up — particularly the fan-centered royalties — but keep in mind that Tidal is only pulling this extra money from subscribers on its top-tier HiFi Plus plan. The regular Premium / HiFi plan isn’t contributing to direct-to-artist payments or fan-centered royalties. In an unsurprising bit of corporate synergy, Tidal says it’ll be working with Square, Cash app, and also PayPal “to ensure quick and seamless payouts to artists globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODbrdT"&gt;All of this comes as Spotify HiFi, announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;nearly nine months ago&lt;/a&gt; at this point, has still yet to launch. Spotify has only said that its lossless tier is expected to be available “later this year.” The company has made no official comment on whether, like its competitors, it will also support Dolby Atmos and other new music formats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medical photography is failing patients with darker skin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iaXVgduCMKFTJvFhte5O6QVUmSs=/0x0:4724x3149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154198/1041978360.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Even medical stock photos only depict white people&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GRYf5M"&gt;Doctors aren’t usually in the business of publishing photography guides. But Jenna Lester, a dermatologist at the University of California San Francisco, was growing frustrated with the poor quality images she’d receive of her dark-skinned patients. It wasn’t just a cosmetic issue — the bad photos meant darker-skinned people weren’t getting the same quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MWRk6"&gt;So in January, Lester co-authored a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.19811"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Dermatology&lt;/em&gt; that gives a step-by-step guide to photographing skin of color accurately in clinical settings. Lester, who herself is Black, said, “I feel like these issues and my life is constantly me saying, ‘Hey, what about us?’ ‘What about these patients?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFWq9h"&gt;Medical photographs are vital to documenting disease in textbooks and journals and training medical students. If they’re not accurate — if, for example, they misidentify important characteristics like texture and color — doctors don’t get as clear a picture of what disease looks like on different people. It then becomes harder for medical professionals to spot potential conditions in their patients. This contributes to disparities in health outcomes for patients of color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeK3xz"&gt;“Across different aspects of medicine, patients with darker skin are getting lower access to screening, delayed diagnoses — and when they are diagnosed, it’s more often at a point where the disease is more severe or higher stage,” says Daniel Cho, a plastic surgery fellow at the Children’s Hospital for Philadelphia. For instance, the skin cancer known as melanoma, although comparatively rarer in Black people, is significantly more likely to kill them. The 5-year survival rates in Black and white individuals are 67 percent and 92 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="INhzy9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“when they are diagnosed, it’s more often at a point where the disease is more severe or higher stage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="30cVBw"&gt;Bad photos of dark skin aren’t specific to medicine. Bias has plagued photography since the days of film cameras. Before the advent of commercial digital photography in the late 1990s, lab technicians in camera stores would color-calibrate film by comparing a customer’s photos to a standard called a “&lt;a href="https://cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2196/3069"&gt;Shirley Card&lt;/a&gt;.” Named after Shirley Page, the original model who was pictured, these cards were used to ensure the color, hue, and tone of a customer’s image remained consistent and balanced against the so-called default photo. That default was whiteness, as almost all the Shirley Card models were white. This made it harder for photographers to accurately depict details of darker hues. The chemical coatings on photos also weren’t designed to be sensitive to non-Caucasian flesh tones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUYgNk"&gt;The result was that in photos with dark- and light-skinned people together, the darker-skinned person’s features were often erased, lacking the fine detailing afforded to the fair-skinned people. In the mid-1990s, Kodak began introducing multiracial Shirley Cards in an attempt to expand their global reach, which improved the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izgUjo"&gt;Since then, digital photography technologies have evolved. For instance, cameras that can balance two different skin tones within the same image now exist and make it easier to represent a greater variety of skin tones at the same time. But the idea of whiteness as the standard in photography has prevailed — creating serious problems, especially in medical photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YNVl32"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the idea of whiteness as the standard in photography has prevailed — creating serious problems, especially in medical photography&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TMgKMu"&gt;Within highly visual medical fields like dermatology and plastic surgery, physicians rely heavily on photographs of a patient’s skin to aid in diagnoses and treatment plans. But images of conditions on light skin are overrepresented in medical journals and textbooks. That’s problem number one, Lester says. “Problem number two is if you only see one tone of non-white skin. And problem number three is that if that tone of non-white skin looks nothing like it would in real life, how do we make a diagnosis?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKoMPv"&gt;The issue of bad photos of dark-skinned patients is widespread. “I see terrible photos all the time of dark skin,” Lester says. “When I’m flipping through a patient’s chart, and I’m trying to monitor disease over time, the photos that other people have taken have not been great.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DopFBG"&gt;For instance, a bad photo of inflammation on dark skin may make the already subtle condition difficult to see. In a person of color, the use of a flash or&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;bad lighting can drown out the problem, and the inflammation may seem to blend into the skin. On the other hand, a well-captured image of the same taken near a window using natural light could allow a clear distinction between healthy and unhealthy skin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xcd60"&gt;Lester says the best photos come out of health systems with specialized photography departments, which are rare. Most clinical photos are taken by well-intentioned doctors who haven’t been trained in the nuances of photographing patients of different races. There are fundamental differences in the physics of how light interacts with different skin tones that can make documenting conditions on skin of color more difficult, says Chrystye Sisson, associate professor and chair of the photographic science program at Rochester Institute of Technology, the only such program in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Yr8OS"&gt;Interactions between light, objects, and our eyes allow us to perceive color. For instance, a red object absorbs every wavelength of light except red, which it reflects back into our eyes. The more melanin there is in the skin, the more light it absorbs, and the less light it reflects back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmRofG"&gt;“If you wrote with a red pen on white paper, the white paper reflects all those wavelengths back at you to appear white, and the red pen stands out in comparison,” says Sisson. Darker paper, though, absorbs more light. If someone writes with the same pen on that darker paper, the red reflection doesn’t stand out as much. That’s why some red skin conditions like inflammation or rosacea can appear more subtle on darker skin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QHceRs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;some red skin conditions like inflammation or rosacea can appear more subtle on darker skin&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkkI7n"&gt;But standard photographic setups don’t account for those differences. For instance, although many &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2758218"&gt;medical journals&lt;/a&gt; recommend using flash for photographing patients, it can compromise detail when done on dark skin. The contrast of the bright flash of the camera against dark subjects can make dark things appear darker than they are, reducing detail in dark skin. The reflection of the flash back from the skin can also obscure the skin tone underneath and leave a shine, an effect that is more pronounced on darker skin. “Whatever standard setup you come up with needs to take that into account,” Sisson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdiosR"&gt;These biases may also be increasingly cemented within new technologies, like artificial intelligence algorithms that are trained to detect conditions using clinical photographs. Google Health &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that it is hoping to pilot an AI-powered dermatology assistant tool to assess skin conditions and provide access to authoritative information on them. The company trained a deep learning algorithm on a set of over 16,000 pictures of various skin conditions. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3#MOESM1"&gt;only 3.5%&lt;/a&gt; of these cases depicted dark and deep brown skin. Out of these photos of dark skin, it’s impossible to tell how many of them were taken using techniques that make sure they’re truly representative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i06dMx"&gt;Clinical images are also frequently used in teaching materials, meaning the next generation of medical professionals is being trained with a scarcity of representative photos. And as telehealth becomes increasingly important, patients will need to be taught how to take accurate images of their conditions — which becomes hard when even their doctors don’t know how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwekeq"&gt;The consequences of these compounded issues are what motivated Lester to compile the set of tips for photographing skin of color in a medical context — instructing people to pay close attention to lighting and choosing the color of background drapes carefully, along with other techniques. Lester hopes that her guidelines will prompt others in the field to question what “standard” practice means and who it was built for and serve as a stepping stone in bridging health equity gaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NBxbp8"&gt;“Recognizing that there are nuances and differences is an important first step in making the necessary adjustments to having a photograph that looks representative,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart</title>

      &lt;img alt="Walmart DTD 555" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J1sVDLMyFhHiEXvLMs9mRbpKOfk=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154121/walmart555.1419973090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is already discounting the AirPods Pro, Google Nest Mini, and a host of other products ahead of Black Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;As Black Friday approaches, several retailers are already offering significant discounts — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is dropping early Black Friday deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;The store will continue to publish more deals as we get closer to the big day, with many of the better deals going live on November 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2F3520-secaucus-nj%2Fweekly-ads&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent online circular&lt;/a&gt;. If you subscribe to Walmart Plus, the retailer’s equivalent to Amazon Prime, you’ll also gain access to the deals four hours in advance. Regardless of when you plan on doing your shopping, however, we’ll continue to update this page throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="K6KslT"&gt;If you’ve been tracking Amazon’s lead-up to Black Friday like we have, you’ve likely seen the online retail giant rebrand its “Deal of the Day” page to “Epic Daily Deals” and now “Early Black Friday Deals.” We’re nearly on the precipice of full-on Black Friday sales everywhere — when that landing page will be transformed yet again — but there’s already a lot to consider if you plan on getting your holiday shopping done early. In fact, Amazon has a slew of deals worth jumping on now if time is of the essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh61Pd"&gt;Below are a variety of deals worth your time and attention, especially if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber. If you’re cross-shopping at the other major retailers, we’ve also put together a more general roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; to look out for.

    <title>Clean energy faces its own supply chain crisis </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senator Ossoff Travels Across Georgia, Highlights Key Clean Energy &amp;amp;amp; Infrastructure Projects" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FcmQffXgo8MmoliMBN3J415Nres=/1x0:3999x2665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154007/1232671596.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="riKV7J"&gt;The future of energy in America will depend on whether the US can break free from its dependence on other countries that dominate clean energy supply chains. To reach the Biden administration’s energy and environmental goals, the US will have to dramatically scale up its mining and manufacturing, lawmakers argued today during a joint &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-securing-americas-future-supply-chain-solutions-for-a-clean"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; of the House Energy Subcommittee and the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee. They also raised serious concerns about the US’s ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yzpDE"&gt;“The sustainable economy of the future will definitely need to be built and manufactured. The question that remains to be seen is whether it will be manufactured by Americans,” said Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY) in his opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ToGwIG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The question that remains to be seen is whether it will be manufactured by Americans.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H450wl"&gt;Joe Biden has pledged to get the US on a path to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a key target that climate scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; as necessary to stave off catastrophic effects of climate change. On the way there, Biden envisions a 100 percent “clean” power sector by 2035. He also wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;half of all new cars&lt;/a&gt; sold in 2030 to be electric or hybrid vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XG5tuP"&gt;Those ambitions, however, will depend on the US’s ability to get enough solar panels, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and other critical clean energy technologies and raw materials. But supply chains for these technologies, and for the raw materials like lithium and cobalt that underpin them, are largely concentrated overseas. This was already creating challenges for the US before the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22757240/global-supply-chain-management-shortage-covid"&gt;screwed up supply chains&lt;/a&gt;, and there are even bigger hurdles to overcome now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gidJ0J"&gt;The supply chain for solar panels is an illustrative example. Only 3 percent of solar photovoltaic modules shipped around the world in 2020 were made in the US. Mining and manufacturing for solar power technology is concentrated in China. &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Briefing%20Memo_ECCENG_2021.11.16_0.pdf"&gt;Sixty-three percent of polysilicon, a key material in solar panels, is produced in China. Seventy-nine percent of solar cells are built in China.&lt;/a&gt; The US mines some polysilicon but, without domestic facilities, sends it to China to be processed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9leP0"&gt;By 2020, the International Energy Agency had crowned solar energy “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514902/solar-energy-cost-historic-low-energy-agency-outlook-2020"&gt;the new king&lt;/a&gt;” of electricity supply because of falling costs and its projected growth over the next several years. But pandemic-induced inflation and supply chain bottlenecks now threaten that progress, according to an October &lt;a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/most-of-2022s-solar-PV-projects-risk-delay-or-cancelation-due-to-soaring-material-and-shipping-costs/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Rystad Energy. Rising costs now jeopardize more than half the projected capacity of new utility-scale solar projects planned for 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frnBX0"&gt;Other clean energy technologies and raw materials are similarly vulnerable to global shocks and are dominated by China or a handful of other countries. This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-faces-uphill-climb-to-rival-chinas-rare-earth-magnet-industry-11618133603"&gt;rare earth elements&lt;/a&gt; used in electric vehicle motors and wind turbines and the lithium inside electric car batteries.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Department of Energy released a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524663/us-lithium-battery-supply-chain-broken"&gt;national blueprint&lt;/a&gt;” to boost domestic production of lithium batteries back in June. Without any interventions, a previous &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/FCAB%20National%20Blueprint%20Lithium%20Batteries%200621_0.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that US battery production capacity&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;wouldn’t be able to meet even half of the projected demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles in 2028 as more people leave gas-powered cars behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PknZkV"&gt;Republicans and Democrats sparred with each other and with experts who gave testimony over the feasibility&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of Biden’s timeline for a clean energy transition&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;given the supply chain challenges. “We can produce more and more of these products that we use for renewable energy, but we can’t get it done on the timelines that are being put out,” Congressman Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) said. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) described the clean energy transition as a “rush to green radical agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsDnOd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are well behind on a transition that’s taking place around the globe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTktap"&gt;“Only here in the US is this viewed as a rush,” Ethan Zindler, head of Americas at energy research firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance, who gave expert testimony, shot back. “We are well behind on a transition that’s taking place around the globe,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kRl5d"&gt;To achieve its energy aims, Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill into law this week that invests in electric vehicle charging stations and funds a big overhaul of the US electric grid. If Democrats manage to pass an even larger spending bill languishing in Congress, an even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759985/biden-budget-reconciliation-infrastructure-bills-power-grid-climate"&gt;bigger investment in clean energy&lt;/a&gt; could be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiKl4P"&gt;Republicans slammed Democrats for boosting spending for clean energy while Americans face higher costs for oil and gas during a global supply pinch. Democrats defended the infrastructure legislation, calling it a “counter-inflationary” measure that would create jobs and make the US competitive against China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7Fzov"&gt;Another point of contention was whether the US should dig up more critical minerals on its own land. That would decrease dependence on outside sources, but it poses potential threats to the local environment and nearby communities. The largest lithium resource in the US, for example, sits on land and a potential gravesite &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;held sacred by &lt;/a&gt;members of the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/protest/native-opposition-to-nevada-lithium-mine-grows/"&gt;Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe&lt;/a&gt; in Nevada. Activists are also &lt;a href="https://www.sierranevadaally.org/2021/05/20/people-of-red-mountain-statement-of-opposition-to-lithium-nevada-corps-proposed-thacker-pass-open-pit-lithium-mine/"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; that a proposed mine at that site, called Thacker Pass, could harm local wildlife and exacerbate a water shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UK3YRd"&gt;“We’re restricting mining in America to acquire these critical minerals that we need for renewables, but you don’t like getting them from China or the Congo,” Representative David McKinley (R-WV) said. “I have to say you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIVaqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t have your cake and eat it, too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvPz9O"&gt;An expert from Redwood Materials, a lithium battery recycling company founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, advocated for building up the US’s battery recycling capacity as an alternative solution to the US’s supply chain woes. “Quickly ramping a domestic battery material supply chain using the highest possible percent of local recycled raw materials is the best way we can help meet the US’s energy goals,” said Jackson Switzer, director of business development at Redwood Materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EZNni"&gt;The hearing went on for over four hours as lawmakers probed everything from China’s history of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-xinjiang-solar/"&gt;labor abuses tied to solar panels&lt;/a&gt; to how to ensure that clean energy comes with good jobs in the US. While Biden has made well-paid jobs a central talking point of his clean energy agenda, witnesses reminded lawmakers that all the talk still needs to turn into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcz8TZ"&gt;“I’ve spent a lot of time over the last 15 years testifying and speaking on panels about the hope of the clean energy economy for my members and really for domestic industry,” Roxanne Brown, international vice president at large for United Steelworkers, said in her expert testimony. “And it’s been too long to be having this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon to ban Visa credit cards in the UK in battle over payment fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Visa logos appear on credit and debit cards arranged for a p" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-8RtHfyYOpPRFRhQ-Y7S07kJMk=/148x0:3045x1931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153572/94970658.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nkIhaT"&gt;Amazon will stop accepting payments from Visa credit cards issued in the UK from January 19th, 2022. Customers will still be able to use Visa &lt;em&gt;debit&lt;/em&gt; cards issued in the UK, as well as credit cards issued by MasterCard, American Express, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;other firms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzpF8J"&gt;Amazon is blocking UK credit cards from Visa as part of an ongoing battle over “interchange” fees — levies charged by card issuers to a merchant’s bank for each transaction. Visa’s interchange fees for transactions between the UK and the European Union (where Amazon UK processes payments) were previously capped at 0.3 percent by EU law. But since the UK left the EU, Visa has been able to &lt;a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-payments/visa-raises-interchange-fees-for-uk-based-cardholders--1247923"&gt;hike that fee&lt;/a&gt; to 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QPO5fP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear why Visa is being singled out by Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7e4liK"&gt;However, Visa isn’t the only company to make such a change. MasterCard made an &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39f553a0-00c5-48ad-a8ee-0b9fd75554b0"&gt;identical increase&lt;/a&gt; to its interchange fees before Visa, but it hasn’t been blocked by Amazon. It’s not entirely clear why Visa has been singled out. It may simply be a strategic decision on Amazon’s part — to hurt one company instead of taking on an entire industry. Or there may be specific complications in Visa’s payment policies. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/amazon-will-stop-accepting-visa-credit-cards-issued-in-the-u-k?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company has increased interchange fees for e-commerce sites, while reducing fees in other areas, like education and real estate purchases. It’s not clear if policies from MasterCard or other card issuers make similar distinctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxVhvQ"&gt;In a statement from an Amazon, the company said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="7D13fU"&gt;“The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers. These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise. As a result of Visa’s continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon.co.uk will no longer accept UK-issued Visa credit cards as of 19 January, 2022. Customers can continue to use all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and other non-Visa credit cards to shop on Amazon.co.uk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xFSPJK"&gt;While a spokesperson for Visa &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59306200"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UAQPoS"&gt;“UK shoppers can use their Visa debit and credit cards at Amazon UK today and throughout the holiday season. We are very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future. When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins. We have a long-standing relationship with Amazon, and we continue to work toward a resolution, so our cardholders can use their preferred Visa credit cards at Amazon UK without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Sonos finally adds DTS audio support to its home theater lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/etXtoJcBH1K_lTpON8gdOua5W3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153469/cwelch_290921_4780_5672.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVmXab"&gt;Sonos’ &lt;a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3521?language=en_US&amp;amp;ver=134"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt; contains big news for surround sound fans: the addition of DTS audio support for its home theater speakers. These include not just newer speakers like the second-generation Beam and Arc, but also older devices like the first-gen Beam, the Playbase, and even the Playbar that originally launched in 2013. Even the Sonos Amp is getting in on the DTS action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNyObw"&gt;For those unfamiliar with the technical nightmare that is home cinema audio, DTS is a rival surround sound format to Dolby Digital. So DTS support means that Sonos users can benefit from surround sound across more sources, like Blu-ray discs that use the DTS format. The release of the update comes a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22764957/marvel-disney-plus-imax-expanded-aspect-ratio"&gt;Disney announced&lt;/a&gt; that DTS audio support will be coming to its Disney Plus streaming service in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8q6UFZxSeqxnfaKdU7QGfr3lRQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021345/6LXPooz.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/qvcc4s/comment/hkvu1d1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3" target="_blank"&gt;u/No_Author_4413&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A “DTS Surround 5.1” badge appears when compatible audio is being played.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oh7pfI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/qvcc4s/dts_digital_surround_now_supported_with_latest/"&gt;Users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; who’ve tried out the functionality report that Sonos only seems to support standard DTS Digital Surround, so you won’t be able to get the most out of sources that use the higher specced DTS-HD and DTS:X formats. If you try and play DTS-HD, it reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/qvcc4s/comment/hkwobw2/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;comes through as regular DTS&lt;/a&gt;. The Sonos app shows a small “&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/a/H18wYZW"&gt;DTS Surround 5.1&lt;/a&gt;” badge when a speaker system is playing the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GYRq3"&gt;Other niggles you might need to watch out for are whether your TV supports DTS audio. LG’s popular &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/cx-oled"&gt;CX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/c1-oled"&gt;C1&lt;/a&gt; OLED TVs, for example, don’t support DTS, which means you’ll run into issues if you’re passing DTS audio through them via HDMI. Sending audio directly from an external source to your Sonos equipment &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1yZSa"&gt;Other new features introduced as part of the 13.4 update include a new Battery Saver mode for portable Sonos products like the Roam which, when activated, will automatically turn the speaker off after 30 minutes to conserve battery life. By default it currently just goes into a low-power sleep mode. The Now Playing screen in the Sonos app on iOS includes a new shortcut to access EQ settings and a new HD badge that will appear when “higher quality audio” is being played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD60Uy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LA’s Staples Center will be renamed ‘Crypto.com Arena’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Utah Jazz v Los Angeles Lakers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/81r94hs0Gkg4m1PMc59nuMXMbb8=/4x0:4252x2832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153268/521074336.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3yoJ9c"&gt;The Staples Center, home to Los Angeles sports teams including the Lakers, Clippers, Kings, and Sparks, is getting a new name: “Crypto.com Arena.” Yes, Crypto Dot Com Arena. The cryptocurrency exchange paid more than $700 million for 20-year naming rights, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-11-16/crypto-staples"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the largest such deals ever. Staples paid $100 million for the rights for 10 years in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="263h0N"&gt;The logo will reportedly be revealed on Christmas Day for the Brooklyn Nets’ game with the Lakers, and Staples Center branding should be phased out by June. “In the next few years, people will look back at this moment as the moment when crypto crossed the chasm into the mainstream,” Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek tells the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;. “This is just such a brilliant move from the guys at [venue owner] AEG, because the next decade belongs to crypto.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLntaO"&gt;The Clippers’ star forward Paul George is less convinced by the move. “I grew up with ... Staples Center being the place to play and the place to be,” he says in comments &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenGolliver/status/1460856127722115074"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;’s Ben Golliver&lt;/a&gt;. “It will definitely be weird. It’s the same location, but it‘s kind of stripping the history here… Good thing we won’t be here too long.” The Steve Ballmer-owned Clippers are moving to a new arena called Intuit Dome in 2024; the Staples Center is currently the only arena shared by two NBA teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mIB1fo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA tries to make a slam dunk out of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HdhHJd"&gt;Crypto.com is based in Singapore and offers a Visa rewards debit card that can be used with cryptocurrencies stored in users’ accounts after being traded on its exchange, as well as providing other crypto services like NFTs and its own token. The company has ventured into sports sponsorship before, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/29/formula-1-strikes-100-million-cryptocurrency-sponsorship.html"&gt;$100 million deal with Formula 1&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and various partnerships with teams including Paris Saint-Germain, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Montreal Canadiens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1kp7g"&gt;The NBA, of course, is no stranger to blockchain technology, having partnered with Dapper Labs to launch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;Top Shot trading card platform&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most mainstream implementations of NFTs to date. And earlier this year, the Miami Heat’s home American Airlines Arena was renamed after crypto exchange FTX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fujifilm announces film-digital hybrid Instax Mini Evo camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKgexFZeZclhJ3g8NU71w4guqA0=/0x3:1500x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70153095/thum_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sx6hD5"&gt;Fujifilm has &lt;a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/7203"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the Instax Mini Evo, a new digital camera that prints to Instax Mini film. The company describes it as a new Instax flagship that has been “designed with a premium and classical touch;” and it has several retro elements including top-mounted dials and a print control that works like a film advance lever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GULfVN"&gt;Like other hybrid Instax cameras, the Mini Evo has an LCD screen to help you frame your digital shots before printing. The Mini Evo includes ten lens effects that can be combined and applied to photos, and Fujifilm says that it has twice the exposure resolution of previous models. Image quality from Fujifilm’s previous hybrid Instax cameras &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15725890/fujifilm-instax-sq10-review-instant-polaroid-digital-camera"&gt;hasn’t been great&lt;/a&gt;, so we’ll have to see how this one works out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/41ukrRRfAzMhC4ZIdvVn9qFsyJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23021017/thum_03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4rXmA8"&gt;The Mini Evo also works as an Instax printer, meaning you can print out pictures from your smartphone wirelessly. In the opposite direction, Fujifilm has added a new feature to let you save printed Mini Evo photos to your phone complete with embedded Instax frames, so you can share them as digital Instax snaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGlZfn"&gt;Fujifilm will release the Instax Mini Evo in Japan on December 3rd, but it won’t make its way to the US until February. It’ll cost $199.95.&lt;/p&gt;
