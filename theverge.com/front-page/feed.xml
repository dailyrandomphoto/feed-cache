    <title>HBO Max update fixes the worst of its Apple TV woes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ShSffe4iCzq3nBcS3gixmzmCj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426541/wjoel_200527_1777_hbomax_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uHisVp"&gt;HBO Max has updated its Apple TV app as it attempts to fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525177/hbo-max-apple-tv-broken-button-controls"&gt;myriad issues&lt;/a&gt; that have been plaguing the software since last week. The update &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;fixes significant problems&lt;/a&gt; with basic features like fast-forwarding and rewinding, which had been introduced after the software switched away from using the native tvOS video player. The software update brings the native player back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boCiIG"&gt;“We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come,” HBO Max &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEKmLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We just released an update to our Apple TV app, restoring the native tvOS video playback experience you know and love, with more improvements to come. Ensuring HBO Max viewers have a quality experience is our top priority and we missed the mark here. Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— HBOMaxHelp (@HBOMaxHelp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402484711423975426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uA2VlS"&gt;Although the worst of the issues appear to have been fixed, users on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/"&gt;HBOMax subreddit&lt;/a&gt; are reporting that some bugs remain after the new update. One user reports that they’re finding their subtitles keep &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOMAX/comments/nvl4yq/fixed/h14cg1l?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reverting back to Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Thankfully, as another user has pointed out, the new update makes it easier to switch subtitles back, a process which the previous update had made &lt;a href="https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly#:~:text=turning%20on%2Foff%20subtitles%20requires%20pressing%20pause%2C%20swiping%20down%20then%20across%20to%20subtitles%2C%20pressing%20again%20then%20scrolling%20to%20your%20desired%20option%2C%20pressing%20yet%20again%20then%20resuming%20playback.%20before%2C%20you%20could%20swipe%20down%2C%20select%20your%20choice%2C%20then%20swipe%20up%20again%20-%20the%20standard%20tvos%20way."&gt;significantly more difficult&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXzQuQ"&gt;Questions remain about how such broken software was able to be released to users in the first place. Responding to a tweet from &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief Nilay Panel, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager Andy Forssell admitted that this was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;” and that the company would be investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Reh2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-06-09T03:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <title>The Vivaldi browser now has mail, calendar, and an RSS reader built-in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0uXbObYQ-mAQ4f5O2fntzJMU5-c=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426491/4_0_hero_image_980x551.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USJQOa"&gt;Vivaldi users will now be able to check their email, calendar, and RSS feeds all through the browser’s built-in tools: &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-4-0/"&gt;the 4.0 release is launching today&lt;/a&gt;, and includes the Vivaldi Mail beta, which promises a more private alternative to web apps made by “Big Tech” companies. Even putting any potential privacy gains aside, Vivaldi is offering something that power users may want: an all-in-one app for browsing, emailing, and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mjoyu"&gt;The email client supports IMAP and POP accounts, so you can connect the vast majority of email services to it, and you can easily have messages open up in tabs rather than taking over the current window — handy if you’re the type who often needs to bounce between emails. The search is also, in my experience, very quick. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlpaOCZzYms1zIZtmWeD5X5okSo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646324/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_3.42.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having your email available as a sidebar can be handy for quickly checking if you have unread messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fDnb0k"&gt;The calendar and RSS reader also include most of the features I’d expect, along with a few really cool bonuses. For example, the RSS reader also supports YouTube channels, which could be handy for those who are worried about an algorithm deciding not to show a creator’s videos. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Csx-WLvJjvNgUIb4bR_p3Zar5jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646383/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_4.21.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can mix RSS feeds, YouTube videos, and even podcasts if you want. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jJNT6d"&gt;The other headline feature of this Vivaldi update is built-in translation. The browser will be able to translate entire webpages (automatically, if you want) in 50 languages as of today, but the company says it’ll be expanding to support 109 languages soon. While the Mail tools are desktop only, the translation is also available on Vivaldi for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVVjxP"&gt;Vivaldi has also come up with a solution for those who don’t want these features taking up room in their browser: you’ll be able to choose between three layouts, which will give you a basic web browser, one with a few power-user features, or the all-in-one experience with email, calendars, and RSS. All the features will still be available, even in the “Essentials” layout, but they won’t be taking up space in the interface. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UhG_ZVp4hsRSzUx4LuVROTafK_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646305/how_much_vivaldi_browser.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The layout options can keep you from getting overwhelmed if you don’t want all the extra features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U1RV4q"&gt;It could be argued that, since many people manage their email and calendars on websites, that most browsers have this functionality built-in. But for those (like myself) whose emails and calendars are spread across multiple accounts, dedicated tools are way less fussy to deal with. Vivaldi is now offering the power that comes with dedicated tools, with the convenience of not having to leave your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus to launch stripped-down Nord CE 5G this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWp7rWH46bNOfBLD1RWCi9PNoko=/0x0:864x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69426437/nce5g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OnePlus Nord CE 5G. | OnePlus via TechRadar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUkr43"&gt;OnePlus is planning to announce a new budget smartphone called the Nord CE 5G this week. &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; has a render of the device &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-oneplus-nord-ce-design-first-look-and-how-oneplus-designed-it"&gt;straight from OnePlus itself&lt;/a&gt;, showing that, well, it looks quite a lot like the original OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkjv80"&gt;The CE 5G, however, will be a little cut back in terms of specs. OnePlus’ product head Oliver Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt; that CE stands for “Core Edition” and refers to a design philosophy where the company had a goal of “distilling the product down to the most important things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUiITm"&gt;“You see mid-range phones on the market with very exaggerated specifications,” Zhang says. “We actively avoided some of those features and kept the things we felt would really make a difference to the daily smartphone experience, like fast charging (Warp Charge 30T Plus), a 90Hz AMOLED display, or 5G.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q16nzR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord review: the right compromises","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UMUIiF"&gt;OnePlus itself has been guilty of these “exaggerated specifications” in the past — the original Nord, for example, had a “quad-camera” setup that included a 2-megapixel macro camera and depth sensor of dubious utility. The Nord CE 5G, on the other hand, makes do with three cameras on the back. That camera proposition, as well as the CE 5G’s processor and price, will be key to the product’s appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ch34QH"&gt;Evleaks has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; several leaked images and a video of the Nord CE 5G, revealing some more features like a 64-megapixel main camera, 7.9mm thickness, and — unlike the original Nord — a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yluuKP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;OnePlus Nord Core Edition 5G &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ovnqoXxKL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9ovnqoXxKL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1402400286937960448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgGeMi"&gt;The full reveal is happening tomorrow, June 10th, at 10PM ET. The Nord CE 5G is being targeted at the European and Indian markets, according to &lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s first folding Pixel is apparently still on track for a 2021 reveal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-aiPnf4WpKmLYvMeGSoAGnNU9QQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425720/vpavic_200907_4181_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Z Fold 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nxU1r"&gt;Google may have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"&gt;shied away from a Pixel Watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a Pixel Fold still very much seems to be on the way — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356760/foldable-google-pixel-q4-2021-leaked-internal-document-5-5a-4a-5g"&gt;a leak last August&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the company was planning to release its first folding Pixel phone in late 2021, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will begin production of folding OLED panels this October for Google, Vivo and Xiaomi’s upcoming folding phones, all of which will reportedly be revealed late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAfTpk"&gt;Google hasn’t exactly kept its folding phone ambitions a secret; in 2019, it published patent applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;for its own folding screens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535863/google-pixel-foldable-phone-prototype-samsung-galaxy-fold-io-2019"&gt;admitted it had been prototyping them for quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, telling &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t have “a clear use case yet.” But now, it appears Google has a foldable, codename “Passport,” that could be nearly ready to announce. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/android-12-beta-model-numbers-pixel-6-family-passport-foldable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; even spotted a new reference&lt;/a&gt; to it last month in Android 12’s code, alongside other codenames believed to be the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 5a 5G. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; says it’ll have a single 7.6-inch panel that folds inward, while Vivo’s upcoming phone will have a 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch outer display. It didn’t mention the size of the new Xiaomi phone’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uSRFA"&gt;It’s not clear whether a Pixel Fold would actually come with a display designed by Google itself, though it’s possible; Samsung acts as a contract manufacturer for many other companies, producing some of Apple’s homegrown processors as one example. Either way, one portion of the screen’s sandwich may still largely belong to Samsung itself: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung will supply its proprietary ultra-thin cover glass (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;which is technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) to other smartphone manufacturers, and Google is expected to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DNbiiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Folding glass: how, why, and the truth of Samsung’s Z Flip","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2vekEL"&gt;Xiaomi already announced a folding phone earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356143/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-folding-phone-announced-price"&gt;the Mi Mix Fold&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like it’ll have a second one. &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt; also reports Oppo will be delaying a new foldable phone to 2022, with a 7.1-inch main screen and a smaller outer one between 1.5 and 2 inches diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max has been busted for days </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IMhD-qZm5Fgljs7YY1kaw_O9nPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425659/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0tRNJ"&gt;If you’ve attempted to stream something on HBO Max from an Apple TV sometime during the last several days, you may have noticed that its player controls are unusable. It’s not just you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqDmgf"&gt;Ongoing issues seem to be related to an &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hbo-max-stream-tv-movies/id971265422"&gt;app update&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly addressed “a few bugs lurking around” on June 5th. Since that update released, users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; that basic playback functionality — such as fast-forwarding, rewinding, and pausing — is borked completely when you try to use the service on an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POJuAO"&gt;How an update this riddled with bugs rolled out to consumers remains unclear. Unfortunately, it’s also unclear when exactly they’re going to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3P1rU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There’s legitimately no way to pause, rewind or fast forward on the HBO Max app no matter if you use the apple remote or the remote mobile app. Idk how anyone is watching anything on there&lt;/p&gt;— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1401730242775961600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgIQWY"&gt;Asked for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was working to fix the issue “as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8wi12"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s editor in chief Nilay Patel tweeted about the issue, HBO Max’s EVP and general manager &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401771759641055244"&gt;Andy Forssell replied&lt;/a&gt; that the company was undertaking “one whale of an effort to address this with app updates as soon as humanly possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8iuUh"&gt;“You’ll hear no excuses from us,” Forssell added, “fixes coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZP1rz"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1401883622089674752"&gt;when asked&lt;/a&gt; by Patel how it was possible that the update shipped to users with broken playback controls, the HBO Max head said that was “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595"&gt;the zillion dollar question&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="60k69f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@reckless&lt;/a&gt; That's the zillion dollar question. First priority is to deliver for users in addressing the issues, but in parallel we will also dive deep into that question. More to come.&lt;/p&gt;— Andy Forssell (@aforssell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1401955206233923595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ro2i5x"&gt;On Twitter, the HBO Max help account is replying directly to frustrated users. “We’re aware that our recent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HBOMax?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; app update for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV"&gt;@AppleTV&lt;/a&gt; led to a number of issues for our viewers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HBOMaxHelp/status/1402409361461460993"&gt;the account said in one tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Our team is working quickly to restore the experience you’re used to. We appreciate your patience and will provide updates as they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gX9MN"&gt;Separately, on Friday,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted the service about reported issues affecting the new Siri Remote’s scrubbing feature — though that issue was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519340/siri-remote-scrubbing-feature-disney-plus"&gt;not limited to just HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a spokesperson said that it was aware of player control issues as well as “a few isolated reports” of HDR playback problems. But the spokesperson also added that the company did not believe the HDR issues were related to an update, as the most recent update at the time did not include changes to the video player itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE5Z0L"&gt;Given the problems with the app right now, if you were hoping to stream the &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; finale on your Apple TV box without issue, you may want to hold off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XsQAR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 9th, 3:52AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; HBO Max has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525635/hbo-max-apple-tv-app-update-native-tvos-player-fixed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;released an update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for its Apple TV app which users are reporting fixes many of the issues detailed above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Apple end the newsletter boom?</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZW5kE"&gt;Today, let’s talk about one of Apple’s many announcements this week at its Worldwide Developer Conference, which some see as a possible threat to the rise of journalism distributed by email. If that sounds self-indulgent, given that it’s coming from a journalist who distributes his work via email, I apologize. But it touches on so many of the subjects of interest to us here — a tech giant’s ability to reshape markets to its liking; how journalism will navigate the platform era; what we mean when we talk about privacy — that I hope I can pique your interest at least a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0lpy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wnk4BD"&gt;Start with the announcement. On Monday at WWDC, Apple announced&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn%2520the%2520Mail%2520app%252C%2520Mail%2Cused%2520to%2520determine%2520their%2520location.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22525195%2Fapple-mail-protection-privacy-pixel-tracking-newsletters-substack" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Mail Privacy Protection&lt;/a&gt;, which will limit the amount of data that people who send you emails can collect about you. Here’s how the company describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aGxsdc"&gt;In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6x6I6C"&gt;When you eventually update your iPhone to iOS 15 this fall, you’ll see a screen at launch that invites you to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="mUonCX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;iOS 15: First launch of Mail app. &lt;a href="https://t.co/W4ewu9XFCk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W4ewu9XFCk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401993816001978375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="04KYBc"&gt;Let’s assume most Apple Mail users opt in. How necessary is this data to building email-based businesses? Over the past day I’ve read and heard lots of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56SUVK"&gt;Some quick background for the non-email obsessives. Long ago, email marketers began including invisible pixels in the emails they send you; when you open their messages, those pixels load, telling the sender that you read their message, and might also infer your location from your IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGydg"&gt;Collectively, the percentage of people that actually open emails is known as the open rate, and it’s one of the most important metrics that senders measure to gauge the effectiveness of what they’re doing. It gives you a sense of how engaged your audience is, and how that engagement is changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYikKE"&gt;At the same time, there is a fairly long tradition of people finding this creepy. The email startup Superhuman &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/superhuman-founder-apology-email-tracking-spyware-backlash-2019-7"&gt;had to apologize in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after a viral blog post explained how the company tracked when, where, and how often people opened emails sent through its service. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, a nonprofit newsroom that often focuses on issues of data privacy, turned down eight potential email providers &lt;a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/themarkup/issues/hello-from-the-markup-199187"&gt;before finding one that would agree to turn off tracking capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFJtaC"&gt;Last year, when Basecamp launched the email service Hey, it made the blocking of tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch"&gt;a marquee feature&lt;/a&gt;. In a blog post today, Basecamp cofounder David Heinemeier Hansson — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;no fan of Apple in general&lt;/a&gt;! — declared victory against tracking pixels. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfxG3V"&gt;Given Apple’s monopoly advantage with their preinstalled Mail app, we don’t need much of an uptake from what they’re calling Mail Privacy Protection to break the dam on spy pixels. You can’t really say anything authoritatively about open rates if 5-10-30-50% of your recipients are protected against snooping, as you won’t know whether that’s why your spy pixel isn’t tripping, or it’s because they’re just not opening your email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfvbxc"&gt;There’s also simply no way users are going to willingly accept the premise of spy pixels if Apple presents the privacy dangers as clearly and as honestly as we’ve done in HEY. Apple already showed that with their drive to block unique ad identifiers for cross-app tracking in iOS 14.5: &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/targeted-ads-are-staggeringly-unpopular-so-we-should-ban-them-01c13a9c"&gt;96% of users in the US have declined to let apps track them like that!&lt;/a&gt; And email spy pixels are far worse and much creepier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8DWPeA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rZR9KN"&gt;Let’s stipulate a few things up front. One, most people still don’t know that these spy pixels exist. Two, if they did, most people probably wouldn’t allow them if given the choice. Three, the majority of these spy pixels are used for marketing purposes — efforts to target you better for e-commerce. I do not think it is at all irrational to look at the state of affairs the way Apple did, and say to hell with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x66xXB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAJgjU"&gt;At the same time, email-based publishing has been of the few bright spots for journalism in recent years. (Certainly it has been a bright spot for me!) Media companies from Facebook to Twitter to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; are now investing heavily in newsletter strategies; new email-based publishers are &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/40-north-tpg-digital-media-startup-funding-69eacb52-1ff8-42ba-8742-32b36d762d3c.html"&gt;popping up seemingly every week&lt;/a&gt;. Much of this has come in the wake of the success of Substack, which I use to publish Platformer (&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;see disclosure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3vav"&gt;And so it’s no surprise that some observers look at Mail Privacy Protection and see a threat. “This is another sign that Apple’s war against targeted advertising isn’t just about screwing Facebook,” Joshua Benton &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/a-packed-set-of-apple-announcements-could-have-big-impacts-on-news-publishers-for-good-and-for-ill/"&gt;wrote in Nieman Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also coming for your Substack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUTtW8"&gt;Benton brings some powerful numbers to buttress his worries: “The &lt;a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/email-client-market-share-may-2021/"&gt;most recent market-share numbers from Litmus&lt;/a&gt;, for May 2021, &lt;em&gt;93.5%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens on phones come in Apple Mail on iPhones or iPads,” he writes. “On desktop, Apple Mail on Mac is responsible for &lt;em&gt;58.4%&lt;/em&gt; of all email opens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5xrPG"&gt;It seems clear that Apple’s move to cut off granular customer data from email senders will affect the email economy. But after conversations with newsletter writers and media executives today, I’m not sure that people doing email-based journalism have all that much to worry about from the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJYHGc"&gt;“The advertising industry has addicted itself to tracking, prioritizing bottom of the funnel metrics at the expense of great content and creative. It’s tragic,” said Alex Kantrowitz, author of the free, ad-supported newsletter &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (He previously covered the industry for &lt;em&gt;Ad Age&lt;/em&gt;.) “And it’s why people hate advertising and ad companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BORsUb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yu5mu5"&gt;Kantrowitz told me that his ad inventory was sold out for the first half of the year, thanks to a premium audience he identified not by pixel-based tracking but by a good old-fashioned reader survey. (&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, too, has used reader surveys to build a picture of its user base.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTGZAX"&gt;“Pixel blocking makes placements like this more valuable and gives quality email newsletters a leg up on the junk clogging most people’s inboxes,” Kantrowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPBUQp"&gt;For ad-based newsletters, then, Mail Privacy Protection is likely to spur publishers to find other ways to understand their audiences. But what about paid newsletters, like the one this column is syndicated from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9vz8d"&gt;Apple’s move may affect reader-supported newsletters even less, publishing industry executives told me today. Writers can triangulate reader engagement by plenty of metrics that are still available to them, including the views their stories get on the web, the overall growth of their mailing list, and — most meaningful of all — the growth of their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OiZpQ"&gt;The media business changes so quickly that I don’t find it at all irrational to read about a move like the one Apple made this week and assume it will be bad for journalism. But in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false alarm. There are any number of changes that major email providers including Apple, Google, and Microsoft could make that would make life more difficult for newsletter-based businesses. In the end, though, I don’t think blocking spy pixels is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xce2am"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="99mWAK"&gt;All that said, I can’t end without pointing out the ways in which Apple itself benefits from cracking down on email data collection. The first one is obvious: it further burnishes the company’s privacy credentials, part of an ongoing and incredibly successful public-relations campaign to build user trust during a time of collapsing faith in institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o30tbg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp1Ndb"&gt;Taken together, the numerous iOS 15 features focused on user privacy combine to place more pressure on the digital ad ecosystem. Perhaps most notably, “Private Relay” — available to paying subscribers of Apple’s iCloud+ service — will encrypt all traffic leaving a user’s device, making them harder for advertisers to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8ePgs"&gt;One of my more cynical friends views all this as a way to funnel more businesses to building apps, offering in-app purchases, and promoting them with Apple’s advertising products. Marketing emails not working as well as they used to? Sounds like it’s time to buy some keywords in the App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCet5h"&gt;And what of creators who want to move away from the ad model? Apple will be there, ready and waiting to take a 30 percent cut of Twitter Super Follows, paid podcasts, and ticketed Facebook events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xdt6y"&gt;It’s sometimes said that Amazon’s ultimate goal is to take a cut of all economic activity. Looking at Apple’s privacy moves this week, I’m mostly willing to take them at face value — as a necessary counter-balance to the inexorable rise of tracking technologies around the web. But it also seems clear that the value to Apple goes far beyond customer satisfaction — and as its revenues from ads and in-app purchases grow, we’d do well to keep an eye on how its policies are gradually reshaping the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Q0E8Sa"&gt;
&lt;p id="pEjYP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate approves billions for US semiconductor manufacturing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Speaker Pelosi Holds Bill Enrollment Ceremony For Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCdxG3iBjDA2cqIu1VyofFyT3aA=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69425295/1232985295.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="spHDan"&gt;After months of political jockeying and procedural hurdles, the Senate approved a massive science and technology bill Tuesday to boost US competitiveness with China. The bill invests billions into emerging technology industries like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum computing in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrtDCD"&gt;The bill — titled the US Innovation and Competition Act or USICA — builds off a previous proposal from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-senator-young-and-representatives-khanna-and-gallagher-introduce-endless-frontier-act-with-12-bipartisan-senators-and-5-representatives-to-dramatically-increase-us-investment-and-leadership-in-science-and-tech-innovation-strengthen-economic-and-national-security-and-keep-the-us-strategically-competitive-with-china-and-other-countries"&gt;Endless Frontier Act&lt;/a&gt;. Endless Frontier was lauded as one of the first big bipartisan bills to come from the Biden administration. But over the last few months, the bill, which was seen as a must-pass piece of legislation for both parties, was bloated with political mush and much of the original funding was watered down as it moved through the Senate process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOIEFp"&gt;In its current form, the bill provides $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, as well as a 30 percent boost in funding for the National Science Foundation and $29 billion for a new science directorate to focus on applied sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kGClzp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Whoever wins the race to the technologies of the future will be the global economic leader”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAugSi"&gt;“Whoever wins the race to the technologies of the future will be the global economic leader,” Schumer said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1402304321815986178?s=20"&gt;in a tweet on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. “We must invest in science, R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing, and innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3C7Ht"&gt;The Endless Frontier Act was originally intended to provide $100 billion in funding for a new science directorate at the National Science Foundation to promote research in emerging tech fields. It would dole out billions to regions all across the country to build out new tech hubs and encourage tech companies to find homes outside of Silicon Valley and the coasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjVjDu"&gt;Last month, the package appeared to be doomed as Republicans withheld their votes to end debate on the bill. Hours after the initial cloture vote was called, Schumer reached an agreement with Republicans to hold votes on parts of the bill they were contesting the following week. Specifically, Republicans were concerned with language in the bill that would require a prevailing wage for semiconductor manufacturers in the US. On Tuesday, an amendment to strike that language was shot down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7Qo8L"&gt;In March, President Joe Biden put out his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;sweeping infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; known as the American Jobs Plan. The original $2 trillion plan contained funding for broadband expansion, roads, highways, and called for $50 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Tuesday’s vote in the Senate marks the next step in achieving parts of the administration’s infrastructure goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDKshs"&gt;Earlier this year, Biden signed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to combat growing concerns over a global semiconductor shortage. The order called for a 100-day government review of supply chains to address shortfalls in acquiring chips. That review was published Tuesday, and the White House &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-launches-task-force-address-supply-chain-disruptions-n1269925"&gt;launched a new task force&lt;/a&gt; to address these supply chain disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QrIOQ"&gt;Tuesday’s USICA approval also provides $10 billion to reshape cities and regions across the US into “technology hubs,” focusing on research and development into cutting-edge industries and creating new, well-paying tech jobs outside of the coasts. The funds will go to the Commerce Department and cities will be able to pitch the government on why it should be on the receiving end of these funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ukXkC"&gt;“This is certainly a welcome injection of resources,” Mike Wallace, legislative director for human development at the National League of Cities, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week. “These are funds that will help local officials, but all stakeholders, think about economic mobility in a regional way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGbjW9"&gt;USICA faced criticism not only from Republicans, but from progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Sanders initially voted to tank the competition bill last month over what he called a “multi-billion dollar Bezos Bailout” that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;authorize $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; for the Amazon CEO’s space venture, Blue Origin, to participate in NASA’s next Moon mission, codenamed “Project Artemis.” Sanders also attempted to negotiate language in the bill that would give the federal government equity interest in exchange for semiconductor grants and aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0udme"&gt;The package still needs to move through the House before President Biden can sign it into law. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanBordelon/status/1402339116423991300?s=20"&gt;Schumer said&lt;/a&gt; that he was “quite certain that we will get a really good product on the president’s desk,” but it’s unclear how long that will take or if the bill will change further.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="elQ9Cv"&gt;Apple’s text selection &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-back-the-magnifying-glass-for-accurate-text-selection/"&gt;magnifying glass has reappeared&lt;/a&gt; in the iOS 15 beta, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s own site&lt;/a&gt; confirms its return by listing it as a feature. Bringing the feature back is a reversal from when Apple made the decision to dump it in iOS 13, which is a bit of a rare occurrence: Apple doesn’t usually go back after it’s done away with something (bringing back scissor switches in its keyboards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;after years of butterfly switches&lt;/a&gt; is a notable exception). The return of the little pop-up is welcome, though: I can only speak for myself, but since iOS 13’s release, I’ve constantly been struggling without the helpful little magnifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC5WA3"&gt;The new version of the text magnifier seems to be a bit smaller than the old one (in case you’ve forgotten what it used to look like, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxapcquSZxs"&gt;a great demonstration here&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s at least better than the nothing that appears in iOS 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaRxtd8kO_pa_upcMuglfrFOUiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645890/Screen_Shot_2021_06_08_at_12.51.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The feature listing on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F8%2F22524824%2Fapple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Did we not want to select exactly the text we wanted before?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88e77i"&gt;It will, at the very least, solve the biggest problem with the current selection system: that your thumb is covering the text you’re trying to select, which makes it &lt;em&gt;a little difficult&lt;/em&gt; to see what’s being selected until you pick your thumb up from the screen. Then, if you’re like me, you’ll probably sigh seeing that the wrong thing is selected, then struggle with the text selection handles to try to highlight what you were actually going for (squinting at the small screen the whole time).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqoiEOLf3_erOksYOeME5AXIfyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22645992/ios_14_selection_woes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It isn’t always this bad, but iOS 14’s text selection leaves something to be desired (and that something is a magnifier).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k6t59P"&gt;iOS 15 is currently in early beta, so anything we see now is subject to change — Apple could always make the magnifying glass more prominent based on feedback, if it seems like a lot of people are still struggling. While this feature isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; enough for me to risk downloading the first developer beta, I think it may be what gets me to immediately grab the first public beta when it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IRS wants more authority to collect data on cryptocurrencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBMmT9cG0I4lBQlMfnJiGHgqQaU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424688/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7BKDMN"&gt;The Internal Revenue Service asked Congress for more authority to request reporting on the transactions of cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/irs-chief-asks-congress-for-authority-to-get-cryptocurrency-data?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The IRS hopes to use the data it collects to develop regulations for the fast-growing crypto industry — if it’s able to get the space’s biggest players to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRkMp4"&gt;The organization made the request during the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing on the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-irss-fiscal-year-2022-budget"&gt;IRS’s proposed Fiscal Year 2022 budget&lt;/a&gt;. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said that the group is challenged frequently in its requests for reporting and “to have a clear dictate from Congress on the authority of [it] to collect that information is critical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqUC8D"&gt;A request from the IRS for actual power to do something about cryptocurrencies makes sense. Proposed legislation regulating the industry has been piling up, especially since Biden took office. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;In December&lt;/a&gt;, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) proposed requiring exchanges to report information (like names, for instance) connected to private anonymous crypto wallets exchanging over $10,000 in a day. It also proposed similar “know-your-customer” requirements &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-proposes-kyc-rules-for-crypto-wallets"&gt;on international transactions&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the government seems to be to make exchanges work more like banks and cryptocurrencies themselves more like cash, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2021/05/31/irs-crypto-tax-risks-expand-with-new-reporting/?sh=c0dfbe97a658"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, with the taxes both would imply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnPlS9"&gt;The most recent case for that conceptual and legal reframing was a request from the US Treasury Department on May 20th. The Treasury (of which the IRS is technically a part) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446364/treasury-cryptocurrency-irs-fraud-tax-evasion"&gt;formally requested&lt;/a&gt; all exchanges to share information on transactions over $10,000. The report the department published at the time claimed that “cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion.” Collecting data on those transactions could hopefully make that practice less enticing and the IRS’s request makes it clear it’ll need help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6P1Ulr"&gt;However Congress and the IRS choose to move forward, the request is yet another example of the growing effort to take the wild out of the cryptocurrency industry’s Wild West. With the popularity of crypto, there’s bound to be more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmUOSo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US wants to fix its broken lithium battery supply chain  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ECONOMY-lithium-battery" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlamuhqlRlrgmPpVbKHElq8rWTA=/5x0:5261x3504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69424505/1231679704.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This photo taken on March 12, 2021 shows workers at a factory for Xinwangda Electric Vehicle Battery Co. Ltd, which makes lithium batteries for electric cars and other uses, in Nanjing in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldMZxw"&gt;The US announced plans to build out a domestic supply chain for lithium batteries, which are critical for electric vehicles and renewable energy. Its new goal is to be able to do nearly everything — from mining to manufacturing and recycling batteries — within its borders by the end of the decade. If it fails, the US could struggle to meet its own&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;climate goals and compete in the growing electric vehicle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N5wxn"&gt;The Department of Energy (DOE) released a “&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/national-blueprint-lithium-batteries"&gt;national blueprint&lt;/a&gt;” today outlining how it plans to boost America’s ability to make lithium batteries. Demand for these&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;batteries has already skyrocketed for electronics and electric vehicles. Spruced-up electricity grids will also need large&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;batteries to accommodate increasing amounts of solar and wind power. In its blueprint, the DOE even makes a case for battery-powered planes to take to the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iZatIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our supply chains for the transportation, utility, and aviation sectors will be vulnerable and beholden to others for key technologies.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zgOpJO"&gt;Right now, the US is a small player in the global battery industry. China dominates both battery manufacturing and mineral supply chains. On its current trajectory, the US is expected to be able to supply less than half the projected demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles on its roads by 2028. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffi3X0"&gt;“These projections show there is a real threat that U.S. companies will not be able to benefit from domestic and global market growth,” the blueprint says. “Our supply chains for the transportation, utility, and aviation sectors will be vulnerable and beholden to others for key technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vVrZ6"&gt;A lot of what’s holding the US back, according to the DOE, is a lack of a national strategy. So to turn things around, the DOE laid out its priorities for federal investment in the technology this decade. One of the biggest problems to tackle is how to nab enough key minerals. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421081/critical-minerals-climate-change-goals-clean-energy"&gt;looming shortage&lt;/a&gt; of lithium, cobalt, and nickel used in batteries. To make things worse, these things are only mined in a few places, and labor and human rights abuses are common. That makes finding new mineral&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sources and designing batteries that use less of these materials pretty urgent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VX64Cx"&gt;There’s already a race to tap lithium deposits in the US, and the DOE’s new blueprint will likely accelerate domestic mining efforts. The DOE also called for mandating recycling so that battery makers can eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951807/electric-vehicles-battery-recycling"&gt;harvest more materials&lt;/a&gt; from old products. Longer term, the DOE actually wants to find a way to make lithium-ion batteries without cobalt and nickel by 2030. (Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451670/tesla-cobalt-free-cathodes-mining-battery-nickel-ev-cost"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last year that it would make EV battery cathodes without cobalt). Through better design, it ultimately wants to cut the cost of an EV battery pack in half by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtHCh8"&gt;The DOE plans to distribute $17 billion in loans for EV manufacturing facilities in the US. It’s also looking to deploy more large-scale energy storage at federal sites. And it released new guidelines requiring&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;federal contractors and grantees to manufacture the products they’re researching and developing, including anything related to advanced batteries, in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lFfaDv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US will probably need to figure out how to make a lot more stuff on its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MeHAdD"&gt;It’s part of a broader push by the Biden administration to develop more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;domestic supply chains. In addition to lithium-ion batteries, they are also focused on critical minerals, semiconductor chips, and pharmaceuticals. The administration published a larger &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of all those supply chains today and announced a new task force to stop supply chain disruptions. That task force is focused on finding short-term solutions after the COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177024/apple-just-in-time-manufacturing-china-coronavirus-supply-chain"&gt;revealed big weaknesses&lt;/a&gt; in global supply chains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kkCNj"&gt;In the long term, the US will probably need to figure out how to make a lot more stuff on its own. The Biden administration will put aside $100 million in grants for state-level apprenticeship programs that will help create workforces for new domestic supply chains. “Decades of focusing on labor as a cost to be managed and not an asset to be invested in have weakened our domestic supply chains,” deputy director of the National Economic Council Sameera Fazili said in a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/"&gt;briefing&lt;/a&gt; today. “It’s clear from these reports that we need to take action.”&lt;/p&gt;
