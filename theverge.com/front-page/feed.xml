    <title>A Facebook bug exposed Instagram users’ personal email addresses and birthdays</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BUiIHc"&gt;When signing up for an Instagram account, the service promises that your email and birthday won’t be publicly visible. A bug discovered by security researcher Saugat Pokharel, however, made it so that an attacker could easily get that private information. The bug, which was patched after being reported to Facebook, was exploitable by business accounts that were given access to an experimental feature the company was testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qoi1mI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The attack worked on private accounts, and ones that don’t accept public DMs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0E00Zu"&gt;The attack used Facebook’s Business Suite tool, available to any Facebook business account. The experimental upgrade meant that if the Facebook business account was linked to an Instagram account, the Business Suite tool would show additional information about a person alongside any direct message — including their supposedly private email address and birthday. All business users had to do was send a direct message on Instagram to call up the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zMPbB"&gt;Pokharel found that the attack worked on accounts that were set to private and accounts that were set to not accept DMs from the public. If an account did not accept DMs, the user potentially would not receive any notification indicating their profile may have been viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs53HU"&gt;An experienced bug hunter, Pokharel also discovered that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368602/instagram-kept-deleted-photos-messages-on-servers-year-bug-fixed"&gt;wasn’t actually deleting deleted posts&lt;/a&gt; back in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTN7La"&gt;In a statement provided to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Facebook spokesperson said that the bug was only accessible for a short period of time, as the experiment was started in October. The company doesn’t disclose how many users were given access to the feature, but it says that it was a “small test,” and that an investigation found no evidence of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYWByA"&gt;The full text of the statement is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nCejhA"&gt; A researcher reported an issue where, if someone was a part of a small test we ran in October for business accounts, personal information of the person they were messaging could have been revealed. This issue was resolved quickly, and we discovered no evidence of abuse. Through our Bug Bounty Program we rewarded this researcher for his help in reporting this issue to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4qDXVF"&gt;According to Pokharel, Facebook engineers fixed the issue within a few hours of being notified.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Caliphate’s bad source shows the dangers of the podcasting gold rush</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87mrYoVx8Q8EXHYTFgV97xNKGCU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68550392/acastro_201218_1777_mute_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhG0TM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; podcast was a hit — until it wasn’t. The 2018 show, which chronicled the radicalization of a man who joined the Islamic State, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, won a Peabody, and was widely regarded as a feat of narrative nonfiction storytelling. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ head of film, TV, and audio, Sam Dolnick, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-barbaro-daily-podcast-team-launching-weekly-fx-series-1200451"&gt;described the show&lt;/a&gt; as a “cinematic experience” that “absolutely lends itself to TV” and came with “a lot of interest from Hollywood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rfmkq"&gt;Today, however, those days seem far away. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/business/media/new-york-times-caliphate-podcast.html"&gt;appended&lt;/a&gt; a lengthy and apologetic editor’s note to the show’s landing pages after doubts about the central character’s story surfaced. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reassigned the show’s star reporter and host, Rukmini Callimachi, and dropped a full episode in its feed discussing what went wrong. The paper of record, well-known for its audio work with &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;, now has a stain on its podcasting endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxRdf6"&gt;This is a monumental moment for the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, for sure, but also for the much-hyped and growing podcasting industry. Podcasting has become a critical bet for many media companies that hope a cheaper investment in audio and podcasting might yield high returns in IP deals from streaming or video production companies. For many, podcasting has become a major revenue source, both because of advertising and IP opportunities. But the push for monetizable content, specifically that which can be sold to Hollywood executives, goes against typical journalist rigor. Fact-checking takes time, as does fully reporting a story. Hollywood moves fast — and who knows how long those podcasting deals will stick around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6a1cVi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Caliphate’ generated interest from Hollywood&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ECVyA"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/18/944594193/new-york-times-retracts-hit-podcast-series-caliphate-on-isis-executioner"&gt;NPR today&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dean Baquet admitted that the paper wanted &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt;’s story so badly that it didn’t adequately vet the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfSPee"&gt;“I think we were so in love with it that when we saw evidence that maybe he was a fabulist, when we saw evidence that he was making some of it up, we didn’t listen hard enough,” he says, of Shehroze Chaudhry, the central character in &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuiUiE"&gt;In this case, Baquet says the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; did not have evidence Chaudhry had ever been to Syria or that he had joined ISIS or killed civilians for the group, all of which is claimed in the podcast. NPR also reports that top editors who have edited complex written investigative pieces saw red flags but ended up giving in to an “ambitious audio investigative team presenting a compelling narrative yarn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gegkSh"&gt;But the problem is much bigger than &lt;em&gt;Caliphate &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The true crime genre, while widely popular, was in this spotlight last year over &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/crime-junkie-podcast-accused-plagiarism-episodes"&gt;allegations of plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; against the show &lt;em&gt;Crime Junkie&lt;/em&gt;. Cathy Frye, a former journalist who worked for 15 years at the &lt;em&gt;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, claims the show’s hosts ripped off her reporting without crediting her. The episodes in question were then suddenly deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9K3VHD"&gt;Robin Warder, who hosts&lt;em&gt; The Trail Went Cold&lt;/em&gt; podcast, told &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/crime-junkie-podcast-accused-plagiarism-episodes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time that the broader true crime genre has a problem with sourcing and facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gN3iE5"&gt;“There are sometimes issues in the true crime podcasting world with shows not citing their sources, and some podcasts don’t do any research besides reading off Wikipedia,” he told &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;. “But &lt;em&gt;Crime Junkie&lt;/em&gt; is probably the most high-profile example of this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZZDq0u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many shows look to real life for podcast material&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="briOic"&gt;Meanwhile, reputable shows like &lt;em&gt;S-Town&lt;/em&gt;, from Serial Productions, which is now owned by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, have had to handle the drama of working with real names and people. Serial Productions &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/s-town-podcast-producers-settle-lawsuit-with-subjects-estate-1234610011/"&gt;settled a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in May this year over the alleged use of the deceased subject’s name for commercial purposes, violating the Alabama Right of Publicity law. (Participant Media &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2018/06/s-town-podcast-movie-tom-mccarthy-directing-this-american-life-participant-media-samuel-hunter-1202409617/"&gt;acquired the show’s feature rights&lt;/a&gt; and is currently developing it to become a full-length film.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9Zeuy"&gt;The push for IP is clearly strong, as is the possibility for revenue for the media companies, stars, their agents, and all of the other Hollywood players. A &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; report &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/podcasts-hollywood-film-tv-adaptations-trend-deals-1234636040/"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; claims the number of podcasts in various stages of development to be adapted into TV or film programs is now well into three figures. Wondery, a podcasting network &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-in-talks-to-buy-podcast-maker-wondery-11606931396"&gt;reportedly in acquisition talks&lt;/a&gt; with Amazon, has over 16 shows in different stages of television adaptation, for example. The gold rush for podcast-generated IP is driving demand for shows like &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt;, which have a clear plot and characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jD6dWX"&gt;“We’re first and foremost a podcast company and we create stories for the ear first,” Jen Sargent, Wondery’s COO tells &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. “But the very nature of the types of shows that we’re greenlighting – they’re character rich – means they do lend themselves to TV. We do now have an eye on whether [a show] can be developed for TV because it’s become such a lucrative part of our revenue stream.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBRAkk"&gt;Wondery has made its name through high-profile narrative nonfiction shows, like &lt;em&gt;Dirty John&lt;/em&gt;, which was buoyed by &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; reporting. But today’s &lt;em&gt;Caliphate&lt;/em&gt; news shows that strategy has its own risks. The desire to produce a cinematic but true podcast naturally creates tension — all storytellers want a good plot, but an especially juicy narrative likely has a better chance of high returns. The snag happens when producers seek a story but have to contend with facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F03IN5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hollywood is combing through podcasts looking for visual stories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zDQMaB"&gt;Even well-established, audio-focused endeavors can get fact-checking wrong. In 2012, Ira Glass’ team at &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/TAL_460_Retraction_Transcript.pdf"&gt;retracted its most popular episode at the time&lt;/a&gt; about a man visiting Apple’s manufacturing plant in China. The person behind the episode, Mike Daisey, is a theater performer rather than a reporter. Critically, he’d been telling a story similar to the one that aired on &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; on stage for years. But apparently, many details in that show were made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVQZCN"&gt;“Mike’s monologue in reality is a mix of things that actually happened when he visited China and things that he just heard about or researched, which he then pretends that he witnessed first hand,” Glass said in an episode detailing the retraction. “And the most powerful and memorable moments in the story all seem to be fabricated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTac6z"&gt;Glass says his team fact-checked the story’s details about Apple and its manufacturer Foxconn, but when they asked Daisey for his interpreter’s contact information, who’s referred to as Cathy in the episode, Daisey said her real name was actually Anna and didn’t provide any contact information for her. The team didn’t push him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTeIdc"&gt;“I can say now in retrospect that when Mike Daisey wouldn’t give us contact information for his interpreter we should’ve killed the story rather than run it,” Glass said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGEOJZ"&gt;Real life gets mundane, and Daisey seemingly knew an embellished story performed better on stage, and in podcasting, than the true one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khwLdo"&gt;None of this is to say nonfiction podcasts are in dire trouble, but when dealing with real facts and truth, extra scrutiny is needed. That isn’t ideal for a burgeoning industry that’s looking to cash in fast on remarkable stories. But as&lt;em&gt; The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; now knows, the desire for a good story can’t outweigh fact-checking. As more journalistic outfits look to podcasting for revenue, they’ll have to solve the real problem: facts aren’t always sexy, and Hollywood wants a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reportedly designing its own ARM-based chips for servers and Surface PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKctk22it-9UmXLSjkAmD02nXpc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68550255/akrales_190930_3682_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vgzfj1"&gt;Microsoft is designing its own ARM-based processors for servers and possibly a future Surface device, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/microsoft-msft-is-designing-its-own-chips-in-move-away-from-intel-intc?sref=SvwPxqpB"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The processors will be used in servers for Microsoft’s Azure cloud services and be based around ARM designs, according to the report. Microsoft is also reportedly “exploring” using another chip for some of its Surface devices, but it’s not clear if this will progress into a final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHk1wJ"&gt;Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too. Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20888999/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs"&gt;worked with AMD and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; for custom chips for its Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X devices, showing a willingness to move away from just Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Osx2JGpWq-JuqaS_bxzHkKo8OPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19250204/akrales_190930_3682_0006_right.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s custom chips for Surface devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HCKfRC"&gt;Microsoft co-engineered an ARM-based SQ1 processor for the Surface Pro X last year and followed this up with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496677/microsoft-surface-pro-x-refresh-sq2-processor-new-platinum-color-option"&gt;SQ2 variant a couple of months ago&lt;/a&gt;. AMD also worked with Microsoft to create a custom version of its Ryzen processor for the Surface Laptop 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTUKif"&gt;A move to ARM on the server side is certainly more significant, particularly for Intel. Apple has already signaled its move away from Intel chips for its Mac products, with its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 silicon&lt;/a&gt; based on ARM designs. Intel’s Xeon server chips currently rule the server market, and AMD has already been chipping away at this lucrative market with its own EPYC processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJZiJL"&gt;We’ve reached out to Microsoft to comment on the report, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>12 predictions for the consumer internet in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verge 2021 Lede" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j29AMlqbCfKlCxrvldn9OYPMk90=/1x0:5001x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68550169/VRG_2021_v02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AbaTxN"&gt;I like to end each year by surveying you all about your predictions for social networks and the broader consumer internet in the 12 months to come. One, it’s a lot of fun. And two, a year later I get to read the predictions back and feel extremely dumb. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/12/20/21030123/social-media-predictions-2020-facebook-tiktok-slack-google"&gt;Our collective guesses for 2020 weren’t &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt;, exactly&lt;/a&gt; — we nailed Libra (er, Diem) failing to launch, the rise of Discord, the splinternet accelerating, and a total stalemate on Section 230 reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3VCki"&gt;But we missed a lot, too: a rise in curated experiences did not cause algorithms to “fade into the background”; a deepfake app did not go mainstream in the United States; and Twitch streaming did not power the rise of Oculus. (But the pandemic sort of did? It powered the rise of Twitch, anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPt5Kv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1339622589199618048?s=21"&gt;I asked you&lt;/a&gt; what you thought was going to happen on the consumer internet in 2021: product changes, breakout apps, regulation, lawsuits, culture trends, and more. Hundreds responded. Here are the best (admittedly US-centric) guesses I saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFutk8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social networks go crazy for commerce&lt;/strong&gt;. This one is well on its way — witness Facebook’s move this fall with the Instagram shopping tab and WhatsApp shopping carts — but look for others to try it on in 2021. “Live video shopping,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gRamblings/status/1339682855509606400"&gt;says Gautam Gupta, former CEO of NatureBox&lt;/a&gt; — one of several folks to predict that this is the year QVC is reborn on mobile phones. “We believe that storytelling has always been a huge part of driving commerce (online and offline) and the ability to combine storytelling with community in the form of live and social shopping will change the face of e-commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5WxPe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silicon Valley accelerates its investment in products and services for individual creators&lt;/strong&gt;. Platforms &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodtakesalex/status/1339624259170267137"&gt;explore new ways to let creators monetize their audiences directly&lt;/a&gt;, while taking a cut for themselves. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/freialobo/status/1339628012720033798"&gt;Charli D’Amelio for Instagram head of product&lt;/a&gt;? VidCon CEO Jim Louderback predicts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jlouderb/status/1339663655999209472"&gt;a Cameo / OnlyFans tie-up&lt;/a&gt;. Everything is available via subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mQBN8"&gt;Still, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Federa/status/1339637589121372161"&gt;gulf begins to appear between those who pay for content and those who do not&lt;/a&gt;. Subscription fatigue &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/N3on_Online/status/1339623840289198080"&gt;will turn out to be real&lt;/a&gt;. And perhaps &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MtthwKrl/status/1339652091686518786"&gt;we lose at least one more paid streaming service&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upmzAF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote work reshapes the industry&lt;/strong&gt;. With tech giants telling workers they can stay home through June or later — and possibly forever — a thousand new problems will lead to 100 new businesses. Priya Sanger predicts 2021 is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1339622589199618048"&gt;the year that we see major advances in augmented reality and virtual reality focused on office uses&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, everyone begins spending more time in Austin and Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2BsbQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet has a reckoning over porn&lt;/strong&gt;. The Pornhub payment processor deplatforming and related lawsuits &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qbeeert/status/1339628888616480768"&gt;may be just the beginning&lt;/a&gt;. Think: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/N3on_Online/status/1339625864934215680?s=20"&gt;new fights over content moderation, distribution, and ownership&lt;/a&gt;. Open question: what role will OnlyFans play in all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOBL0u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dating apps have a big moment&lt;/strong&gt;. Many of you predict that when the COVID-19 vaccines have been widely distributed, the Earth will experience &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ozskier/status/1339623033116401664"&gt;a period of prolonged horniness&lt;/a&gt; unlike anything that has been seen in generations. Tinder, Grindr, and all the rest are poised to thrive as a result. Wrote consultant Matt Klein, via direct message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0vWgc"&gt;Dating apps continue to thrive as 1. people come out of their homes, and/or 2. people still remain indoors/protective. Both are tailwinds. Match Group stock continues to balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlArOv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio apps take their turn in the spotlight&lt;/strong&gt;. Twitter Spaces and Clubhouse have captured a good deal of attention in Silicon Valley. But lots of you think &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vishalchandra/status/1339623301493112833"&gt;the party may end before 2021 is out&lt;/a&gt;. “They all get relegated to phone sex apps with podcast energy,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/negroprogrammer/status/1339623364713828354"&gt;predicts Regynald Augustin of Dispo and &lt;em&gt;Subtweets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (Incidentally, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/buhlakay11/status/1339693259669590022?s=21"&gt;phone sex &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;happening on Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, and no that link is not safe for work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2uPgf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public social networks continue to fragment.&lt;/strong&gt; Parler won’t be the last breakaway republic from Facebook and Twitter. “I think that there will be more popular ‘free speech’ social networks, and it might even become a separate market, with all social networks either left-wing or right-wing echo chambers,” says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stuffundefined/status/1339661013977804800"&gt;this pseudonymous reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vStZZR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States will need a strategy for the regulation of Chinese apps.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1339623918366203905"&gt;Says ex-Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos&lt;/a&gt;: “There will be another breakout consumer app from a Chinese-aligned multinational and the Biden administration will have to assemble a cohesive strategy out of the wreckage of the Trump-TikTok phony war.” And what of TikTok? I think it will probably end 2021 owned by the Oracle-Walmart consortium, but perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1osnx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The internet saves movie theaters.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dneumann/status/1339628542628409345"&gt;a streaming service buys one of the chains as a perk for subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe the chains stay independent and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/javajoint/status/1339627571684790273"&gt;rent themselves out as virtual conference centers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yolwF5"&gt;Some other things that didn’t pop in my replies but seem likely to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3yXPM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple ongoing lawsuits and proposed regulations — related to antitrust in the United States, and data privacy and competition in the European Union — will slow down Big Tech.&lt;/strong&gt; The US case against Microsoft famously caused it to miss the threat posed to it by the internet; Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg will have to be on guard for the distractions that these cases could bring. (They’re students of Silicon Valley history, and so I imagine they already are.) Still: look for a slower pace of innovation and acquisitions than we might have seen otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGOLZW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech’s labor issues accelerate&lt;/strong&gt;. The divide between management and labor at tech companies big and small seems to be getting bigger all the time — and so far, nothing that managers have done to date has seemed to mollify their employees. Look for more controversies related to failures here, especially with regard to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVgZi7"&gt;As always, there were joke suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rt77tC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tambulla/status/1339638993500184576"&gt;“Section 230 would be repealed and replaced with something that is exactly the same thing.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rq6fZt"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1339622589199618048"&gt;The greatest builders of technology, now all in Miami, start to realize the beach is more fun than staring at a text editor for 16 hours a day. No new apps are released in 2021.&lt;/a&gt;” Thank you, Alex Kantrowitz of &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q7Mz9d"&gt;Related, from Glossier’s Ashley Mayer: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleymayer/status/1339646816048959488?s=21"&gt;VCs learn about hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="G9hPpI"&gt;And from Brian Merchant, senior editor at &lt;em&gt;OneZero:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="l0kLeX"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1339632168012709888"&gt;As the single-creator subscription model for journalism enters a make-or-break year, writers will increasingly turn to social media platforms to crowd-source content to pad out their Substacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="V827bq"&gt;Dammit, Brian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAHBR9"&gt;There are also plenty of much harder-to-predict questions about 2021. Will 2020 election denialists gather into a coherent and possibly violent movement? What, if anything, will President Joe Biden do to rein in Big Tech? Will citizen (or candidate) Donald Trump be banned from Twitter or another social network — and if so, why? What are the long-term effects of the massive Russian intrusion into American infrastructure in the second half of this year? Can Facebook’s Oversight Board create a sense of justice in social networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYV7YW"&gt;I don’t know — but I’m looking forward to finding out. If we learned anything from 2020, it’s that a fresh year is usually full of surprises. I look forward to exploring them together when &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platformer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; returns on January 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt Red promises Cyberpunk 2077 refunds ‘out of our own pocket if necessary’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BunwQQDcr3cYBtJ1Y8YZy1J70Ms=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549827/screen_image_about_b_40a8febe.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wh15ny"&gt;CD Projekt Red (CDPR) has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1340013516628103170"&gt;issued yet another statement&lt;/a&gt; regarding the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;debacle, this time clarifying its stance on retail refunds for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game that have been riddled with bugs and performance issues since launch last week. The developer now says it will honor every refund request it receives between now and December 21st out of its own pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JeOVR"&gt;“We’ve just started reaching out to people who sent us a message with a confirmation of receipt. We send these emails out in waves, so don’t worry if you don’t receive an answer immediately,” CDPR writes in its new statement, issued via the official &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account on Friday afternoon. “At the same time, we’d like you to know that our intention is for every owner of a physical copy, or a digital copy bought at retail, who has valid proof of purchase (and sends us an email at helpmerefund@cdprojektred.com within the time window) to receive a refund. We will do this out of our own pocket if necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tbZLaI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update on Retail Refunds &lt;a href="https://t.co/7hAHo19jfa"&gt;https://t.co/7hAHo19jfa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nFMbhvokvl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nFMbhvokvl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1340013516628103170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="71o91L"&gt;CDPR says digital buyers should pursue refunds from Microsoft and Sony, as both companies have now established formal refund programs for the game. Best Buy is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189238/best-buy-cyberpunk-2077-returns-cd-projekt-red-refund-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;now taking refunds&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;through Monday of next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS7SGW"&gt;This latest clarification from CDPR follows the general confusion the studio caused earlier in the week when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;advised disappointed buyers to pursue refunds&lt;/a&gt; through Microsoft, Sony, and retail stores. CDPR at the time also said it would accept refund requests itself, but it did not disclose until after it issued that initial statement that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;had not established any kind of formal refund program&lt;/a&gt; with any of its partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CwGim"&gt;What followed were revelations that while Microsoft would indeed honor most requests for digital Xbox versions of the game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178872/cyberpunk-2077-refund-sony-ps4-ps5-playstation-issue"&gt;Sony would not&lt;/a&gt; for PlayStation buyers due to its more stringent refund policy. Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;ultimately pulled the game from its digital storefront&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday evening in an unprecedented move, prompting Microsoft to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;expand its existing refund policy&lt;/a&gt; specifically for buyers of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, though the game can still be bought digitally for Xbox devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the difference between FDA approval and authorization?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a sign outside a large building that reads “US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HtJiP8IIB0uzVsWHcMvDfh-51o=/0x0:5741x3827/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549622/1227710766.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAwn27"&gt;In most contexts, it’s perfectly acceptable to use “approval” and “authorization” interchangeably. But not at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and definitely not when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. If the topic comes up at your Zoom holiday party, here’s a cheat sheet for the specific uses of these similar terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6guJm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approval — &lt;/strong&gt;No COVID-19 vaccines have been approved. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/approvals-fda-regulated-products/about-fda-product-approval"&gt;Approval&lt;/a&gt; means the FDA has officially decided that a product is safe and effective for its designated use. The process for approval involves rigorous reviews of all available data on the product and can take several months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMMosZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorization — &lt;/strong&gt;To speed things up in an emergency like a pandemic, the FDA can grant an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization"&gt;Emergency Use Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (EUA). An EUA, as its name implies, authorizes a product for use during unusually urgent circumstances if the benefits of its use outweigh any known or potential risks. A vaccine that combats a global pandemic is an ideal candidate for an EUA – we can’t afford to lose any more time in the midst of a crisis with an ever-climbing death toll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrW835"&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;granted an EUA for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s likely to do the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187693/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-committee-support"&gt;for the Moderna vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this week. As long as no serious harms from the vaccines are discovered, they’ll maintain authorization until the pandemic is over. At that point, the pharmaceutical companies will decide if they want to seek FDA approval. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was granted an EUA for COVID-19 treatment in May before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529244/fda-remdesivir-approval-covid-19-treatment-gilead"&gt;gaining approval in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RryYAp"&gt;The expedited process for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines doesn’t mean decisions are being made willy-nilly. FDA reviewers still had to pore over all the currently available data from clinical trials before signing off on the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQ9ICd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BONUS ROUND: Clearance — &lt;/strong&gt;FDA clearance is usually applied to devices — anything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17855006/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-fda-approved-vs-cleared-meaning-safe"&gt;heart-monitoring apps on a smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; to X-ray machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPkoKv"&gt;The FDA groups medical devices into three classes based on the level of risk associated with their use. Low-stakes products like gauze and tongue depressors are Class I, while products like pacemakers are Class III. Devices in Class III are the only ones which require FDA approval before they can be put on the market. Those in Classes I and II don’t necessarily need to be approved to be marketed. If they’re a brand-new low-risk product, they can potentially get something called a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions/de-novo-classification-request"&gt;De Novo classification&lt;/a&gt;. Others can be cleared by the FDA if they can show that they are similar enough to products that have already been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s Charli D’Amelio is bringing her entire family to Hulu with a new reality series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhSZzvHsebka7FgrGlo68wluIOo=/800x0:5120x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549594/1225293625.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/Getty Images for EIF &amp;amp; XQ&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyJ5Jc"&gt;Hulu has ordered a new reality series based around TikTok’s royal family — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/22/21571189/charli-damelio-100-million-tiktok-followers"&gt;Charli, Dixie, Marc, and Heidi D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly hoping to capture a little bit of what &lt;em&gt;Keeping Up with the Kardashians &lt;/em&gt;did for E! back in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDgcIz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show &lt;/em&gt;is an eight-part documentary series that will follow the four family members as they go about their day-to-day lives. Expect TikTok dancing, TikTok drama, meetings with executives all over Hollywood, and the types of goofs that worked for other reality shows that followed popular families. It will debut sometime in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc17Ng"&gt;For the D’Amelio family, this is just another project they’re adding to their list, which includes podcasts, a YouTube channel, commercials, television specials, and more. Like the Kardashians before them, the D’Amelios see an opportunity to create an empire out of the fame they’ve recently entered into. Charli, for example, has more than 100 million followers on TikTok — the most of anyone on the app. For Hulu, however, &lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show &lt;/em&gt;is a necessary addition for its lineup of reality shows and documentary series that the streamer is banking on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ti5v4H"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show&lt;/em&gt; joins our growing slate of docuseries about the human experience and we’re incredibly excited to partner with the D’Amelio family to offer viewers an authentic look at the complicated lives of these two relatable young women thrust to the top of the social media algorithm,” Belisa Balaban, vice president of documentaries at Hulu, said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIgp3j"&gt;Just recently, Hulu announced that it signed a massive &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/kardashians-sign-major-global-content-deal-with-disney-hulu.html"&gt;deal with the Kardashian family&lt;/a&gt; for new content (not &lt;em&gt;Keeping Up&lt;/em&gt;, which the family announced was ending). Hulu also has reality shows like &lt;em&gt;Taste The Nation with Padma Lakshmi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Eater’s Guide To The World&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming series&lt;em&gt; The Next Thing You Eat &lt;/em&gt;from David Chang&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Planet Sex&lt;/em&gt; with Cara Delevingne&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfI3fi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclosure: Eater is a Vox Media brand and sister site to &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3c4SGx"&gt;Having the most popular TikTok family also available in a series exclusive to Hulu helps with that growing content arm; an area that Netflix has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328481/netflix-franchise-movies-tv-shows-reality-tv-reed-hastings-ted-sarandos"&gt;invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in over the last couple of years as the genre successfully grows. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22018581/discovery-streaming-service-launch-date-price-shark-week-hgtv-food-network"&gt;Discovery Plus launching&lt;/a&gt; in just a few weeks, it’ll also give Hulu some space to compete in the docuseries and reality TV realm, which Discovery (TLC, Food Network, HGTV) owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gU2Rjm"&gt;Whether or not &lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show &lt;/em&gt;winds up being the cultural success that &lt;em&gt;Keeping Up with the Kardashians &lt;/em&gt;was in its earlier seasons depends on if people want to see the D’Amelio family in a longer, more narrative-driven space instead of just 60 seconds at a time on their phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8zLm7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtxOgA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMhbQb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GCqmY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RxcwE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy is accepting Cyberpunk 2077 returns through December 21st, even if you played it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWt4XkU7gjHEJOxyG66qO6Sv_f4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549520/Cyberpunk_2077_screen_8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4A33i"&gt;Best Buy has joined the list of retailers offering returns for copies of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, with the company announcing (&lt;a href="https://forums.bestbuy.com/t5/Gaming-Support/Cyberpunk-2077-Refund/td-p/1372500/page/2"&gt;in a forum post&lt;/a&gt;) that it’ll be accepting returns through December 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzPgBP"&gt;The move is an unusual one for Best Buy, which &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Freturn-exchange-policy%2Fpcmcat260800050014.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat260800050014%26CMP%3Docss&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;typically excludes&lt;/a&gt; opened video games from its usual return policy — in most circumstances, “opened physical copies of computer software, movies, music, video games, books, video game guides and sheet music can only be exchanged for an identical item.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P9CwtT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cyberpunk 2077 developer says disappointed players can ask for refunds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="U9JQmC"&gt;However, in light of developer CD Projekt Red’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;own acknowledgement of issues&lt;/a&gt; with the game — and its offer to supply refunds through December 21st — Best Buy will be offering a similar opportunity for disappointed buyers to return their copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaMvAL"&gt;Per the forum post: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8JUr4W"&gt;Normally, Best Buy is unable to offer returns of opened game software per our Return &amp;amp; Exchange Promise here. However, after some deliberation, and seeing that the vendor will be allowing returns through 12/21/2020, Best Buy will also be allowing returns for select opened Cyberpunk 2077 SKU’s through December 21, 2020. Beyond that date, we will return to our normal Return &amp;amp; Exchange Promise for the game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="69XRhh"&gt;There are a few things that Best Buy customers will need to keep in mind. First off, Best Buy is only accepting returns for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 and Xbox One (including the regular, collectors, and digital editions of the game) — disappointed PC players won’t be able to get a refund, though. Additionally, the company notes that customers who choose to take advantage of Best Buy’s free SteelBook cases for the game will have to return those, too, or else have the value of the SteelBook deducted from their refund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxHvOt"&gt;Best Buy is the latest retailer that’s allowing refunds of the game following the widespread issues with the title on the original PS4 and Xbox One. Since CD Projekt Red’s announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;Sony has offered players full refunds&lt;/a&gt;, while also taking the unprecedented step of pulling the title for purchase entirely from the PlayStation store. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;Microsoft has similarly announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be offering full refunds for the game, although it’ll continue to sell it for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzYI1S"&gt;CD Projekt Red is already working on patches to improve performance, with one patch due out in the coming days, while more substantial updates are planned for both January and February to help address “the most prominent issues” on original Xbox One and PS4 hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Chromebook 2020</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook for every type of user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Android apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chromebook can be more useful than a mediocre Windows laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2020 is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many of the best Chromebooks are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the Lenovo Chromebook Duet as the best Chromebook for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2020 include the Asus Chromebook Flip C434, Google Pixelbook Go, the Google Pixelbook, and the HP Chromebook x360. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UgFhp"&gt;An honorable mention is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous laptop with a unique color and 4K AMOLED display, which didn’t quite make this list because of its unfortunately short battery life. We’re looking forward to reviewing Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook with a thin 2-in-1 design, and the affordable IdeaPad Flex 3 Chromebook which has a unique chassis and an SD card reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebooks 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjxyUU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebook 2020: Asus Chromebook Flip C434" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYnULfa3HJrkV86b9C2G9N0GGc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19138755/vpavic_190731_3630_0080_result.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Flip C434 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KoNNR1"&gt;3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d76D4s"&gt;Best 14-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nprrDB"&gt;Asus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It’s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that’s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo"&gt;best Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; have been doing lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlKx4"&gt;Asus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there’s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTxl8W"&gt;There’s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage — and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn’t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vaH8VJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;4. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZOrDL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;7. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;8. Samsung Chromebook Plus v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Samsung Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot confirms it’s making a League of Legends MMO</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMzGVF7V7nNIOr6om5P8X5CoU3Y=/0x13:1920x1293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549006/patch_10_25_banner.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXRhON"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games is working on a massively multiplayer online (MMO) roleplaying game in the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe, Riot’s VP of IP and entertainment, Greg Street, tweeted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIocDX"&gt;“My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to need!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339722821761605632"&gt;Street said&lt;/a&gt;. “My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.” If the deliberate use of the word “massive” in that quote wasn’t enough of a hint, in a reply to another Twitter user, Street confirmed the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520"&gt;is an MMO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l2idUn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have news!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to need!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because it is time. My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS We’re hiring&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Street (@Ghostcrawler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339722821761605632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="so9ndz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It is an MMO&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Street (@Ghostcrawler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6I3HSy"&gt;The new MMO isn’t entirely surprising, as Riot has been working to expand the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe into other games and mediums as of late. Riot has released a &lt;a href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League-&lt;/em&gt;themed card game&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/teamfight-tactics"&gt;auto-battler&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, the company plans to launch a mobile and console version of the main game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519658/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012514/league-of-legends-riot-indie-game-ruined-king-the-game-awards-tga"&gt;single-player, turn-based RPG&lt;/a&gt; for consoles and PC&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;An animated series, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, is also scheduled &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;for 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and there are two &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/19/12970138/league-of-legends-mechs-vs-minions-board-game"&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; that further flesh out the lore. Riot appears to be following the same formula as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, the studio even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"&gt;partnered with Marvel for &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; comic books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCFgeB"&gt;Street worked on &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; for nearly six years, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgreg-street-b356447%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F18%2F22187980%2Friot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;his LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, so hopefully he can bring some of what has made that game such a hit to this new &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; MMO.&lt;/p&gt;
