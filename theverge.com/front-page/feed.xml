    <title>Fortnite’s new ‘Party Worlds’ put the focus firmly on socializing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V6ayrhANsdLmUVT54BLfFAzZrF8=/0x0:1618x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70213870/fortnite_creative_walnut_world_by_fivewalnut_1920x1080_f43bf22cda3c.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walnut World is one of the two debut Party Worlds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Ucv83"&gt;“Party Worlds” are new spaces coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; which are designed to focus on socializing over combat, the game’s developer &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/introducing-fortnite-party-worlds"&gt;Epic Games has announced&lt;/a&gt;. “These are experiences that are designed as places for players to hang out, play fun mini-games, and make new friends,” the developer says, adding that Party Worlds cannot be centered on “combat or damage.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ile7me"&gt;To kick off the initiative, Epic has collaborated with community members fivewalnut and TreyJTH on a pair of example Party Worlds. One is an amusement park called Walnut World, and the second is called Late Night Lounge and has more of a nightclub vibe. The developer says it’s taking submissions for more community-made spaces. Just use the tag “Party World” for an island, and submit it through &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/submit-island"&gt;this submission form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HF1E7z0y3cbPFe5UsUEpnSi6Ygo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055139/fortnite_creative_late_night_lounge_by_treyjth_1920x1080_2fc0f4dd2a28.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a second Party World called ‘Late Night Lounge.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GIfsbz"&gt;Party Worlds are Epic’s latest attempt to transform &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from a competitive online game into a broader online social space. This has already resulted in numerous features ranging from one-off events like an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;in-game concert from Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode"&gt;combat-free Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;. Users can also already create islands to serve as social spaces rather than arenas using the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/th/fortnite-c75/creative-c96/what-is-creative-mode-in-fortnite-how-does-it-work-a3428"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt;. But with its latest initiative, Epic appears to be explicitly promoting and encouraging users to make these social-first spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWZRTz"&gt;Party Worlds also don’t link out to other islands, so they’re meant as a destination rather than a “discovery tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFVwia"&gt;And yes, this all ties in to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;Epic’s plans to create a so-called “metaverse,”&lt;/a&gt; a fully integrated 3D online space for people to exist in. Epic is now far from the only company explicitly targeting this future (see also: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;), but the maturity of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s technology, not to mention the game’s enduring popularity, mean Epic’s ambitions deserve to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LGssT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QInAut"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut earbuds now come in black</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EYEoYOebik4SywnYml22NOK-fMk=/0x0:7695x5130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70213816/Nothing__1__black_edition_closed_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ear 1 earbuds and case, now in black.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJRzMS"&gt;Nothing’s Ear 1 earbuds, which launched earlier this year in a fetching white and transparent plastic color scheme, will soon come in black. The new Nothing Ear 1 black edition still features transparent plastic in its construction, but now it’s accompanied by matte black plastic. The new color scheme will be widely available from December 13th at the same price as the original white versions: $99 / £99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S787BT"&gt;Aside from the new design, these earbuds are functionally identical to what Nothing released earlier this year. You still get up to 5.7 hours of battery life from the earbuds with noise canceling turned off, dropping to four hours if you turn it on. Alongside the case, you get a maximum of 34 hours. The earbuds are also IPX4 water resistant and can be charged wirelessly using Qi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJacn-BBp2zk5sxSgV_0ByVlPsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23042764/ear1_smoke_still_G_F_001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of the earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="njiWfP"&gt;The company is styling the new color as a “limited edition” but added that it hopes it’ll become “a permanent addition to its range.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGOB1d"&gt;Nothing also claims that its Ear 1 earbuds are now carbon neutral, and that it’s worked with third-party certification company &lt;a href="https://www.sgs.com/"&gt;SGS&lt;/a&gt; to help assess and neutralize its carbon footprint. But the company is also accepting payment for them in cryptocurrencies, whose payment networks are notoriously energy-intensive to run. The Bitcoin network alone is estimated to use about the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html"&gt;same amount of electricity annually as Washington state&lt;/a&gt;, and anywhere from 25 to 60 percent of this reportedly comes from nonrenewable sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5YO1I"&gt;When I asked Nothing about this apparent contradiction, it pointed me toward the &lt;a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/"&gt;Crypto Climate Accord&lt;/a&gt;, an effort to make the crypto industry produce net-zero emissions in nine years’ time in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0PZNf"&gt;If you’d like to buy Nothing’s “carbon neutral” earbuds with cryptocurrency, the company will accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) for purchases made via its own online store in select countries including the US, UK, Canada, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dX2IqG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polaris’ new Ranger XP Kinetic is an all-electric side-by-side with a lot of horsepower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7z5BRyLGLWJGXmqtCLu_JZ_hEjc=/0x1:2000x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70213690/2023_ranger_xp_kinetic_icy_blue_pearl_image_riding_SIX6631_04983.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61yhyN"&gt;Polaris has unveiled the Ranger XP Kinetic, an all-electric side-by-side and the first vehicle to emerge from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21473587/polaris-zero-motorcycles-electric-ev-off-road-vehicle-snowmobiles"&gt;collaboration between the Minneapolis-based company and Zero Motorcycles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Rtq0H"&gt;Polaris is hoping the electric Ranger will help attract new customers to the world of power sports vehicles, which also include ATVs, snowmobiles, personal watercraft, and heavy motorcycles. The segment, which currently represents over $9 billion in sales globally, is expected to grow to over $12 billion by 2027, &lt;a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/powersports-market-105156"&gt;according to market researchers&lt;/a&gt;. And Polaris, through its partnership with Zero Motorcycles, is hoping to expand its lineup of electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LX4www"&gt;&lt;q&gt;two trim levels, Premium and Ultimate, priced at $24,999 and $29,999&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ts9FAx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22302725/polaris-electric-ranger-utv-zero-teaser"&gt;The first will be the electric Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in two trim levels, Premium and Ultimate, priced at $24,999 and $29,999, respectively. Packing 110 horsepower and 140 pound-feet of torque, Polaris claims the Ranger XP Kinetic will be the most powerful utility side-by-side it’s ever produced. That represents 35 percent more power and two times more torque than any other utility side-by-side on the market, Polaris says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZJALn7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10895027"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1hfubF"&gt;Unlike ATVs, which are recognizable for their straddle-seated position and handlebar steering, UTVs are used more for work than recreation. The large, powerful vehicles are commonly used to haul equipment and supplies in locations that make using a truck impractical or impossible. They are also called side-by-sides because they can accommodate both a driver and a passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unTPtk"&gt;The new Ranger will have a towing capacity of up to 2,500 lbs and a hauling capacity of 1,250 lbs. That’s a similar towing capacity to the company’s gas-powered Ranger XP 1000, which starts at $18,799. Towing in an electric vehicle also drains the battery at a faster rate, which reduces range and requires more frequent charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMgidA"&gt;To help with charging, Polaris is teaming up with Qmerit to consult with customers on home charger installation. The Ranger XP Kinetic comes with a Level 1 and 2 charging cable that enables charging from either a 120-volt or 240-volt plug.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JvL1iq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The electric Ranger’s noise profile — or lack thereof — is also being presented as a selling point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gydQtx"&gt;In many ways, the Ranger XP Kinetic is the lightweight, versatile electric vehicle that farmers, hunters, and outdoorsy types may find over time they actually prefer over heavier, higher-profile EVs, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, the Ranger won’t be able to match the electric F-150’s towing capacity and range, but it will certainly handle a wide variety of tasks while taking up far less space and costing tens of thousands of dollars less than Ford’s upcoming EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQoIW"&gt;The Ranger’s two trim levels represent different battery capacities. The Premium trim is equipped with a 14.9kWh battery, offering an estimated range of up to 45 miles, while the Ultimate trim sports a 29.8kWh battery allowing an estimated 80 miles of range. The Ultimate trim also features a seven-inch infotainment screen powered by Polaris’ connected vehicle software and dash-mounted speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt3Ruy"&gt;The electric Ranger’s noise profile — or lack thereof — is also being presented as a selling point. Polaris notes that the quiet-by-comparison electric motor will allow for “stealthy trips to remote hunting spots; quiet operation around horses, livestock and other animals; and landowners can do yard work and other property maintenance early in the morning without disturbing the neighbors or family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHjafK"&gt;Polaris’ gas-powered Rangers generally range in price between $20,000 and $22,000 and are popular vehicles with agriculture workers, hunters, and other outdoor lovers. Whether customers will be willing to pay 25 percent more for their vehicle may come down to more than just a lack of engine noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bG65BW"&gt;To that end, Polaris is also hoping that the prospect of cheaper maintenance costs — 70 percent cheaper, by the company’s estimate — will be enough to sway its customers to the higher price tag. The electric Ranger doesn’t require oil changes, filter replacements, spark plugs, or clutch maintenance, Polaris says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4H1xt"&gt;The Ranger XP Kinetic has been “torture-tested in extreme conditions and treacherous terrain” but will still come with a one-year factory warranty, three-year electric powertrain coverage, and five-year battery coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mlJ0Zo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Ranger XP Kinetic has been “torture-tested in extreme conditions and treacherous terrain”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7jG1bq"&gt;Polaris and Zero Motorcycles signed a 10-year agreement last year to produce a range of electric vehicles, including ATVs, UTVs, and snowmobiles. Both companies hope to seize upon what they think has been an overlooked market for electrification, starting with off-road vehicles and snowmobiles, with the ultimate goal to completely electrify Polaris’ lineup by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2UkwX"&gt;Zero has been occasionally described as the “&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hannahelliott/2014/06/24/meet-the-latest-from-the-tesla-of-motorcycles-the-zero-sr-streetfighter/#48312984394b"&gt;Tesla of motorcycles&lt;/a&gt;” and has established itself over the years as a top-tier maker of electric motorcycles. The Santa Cruz, Calif.-based company currently sells a number of models priced between $10,000 and $17,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3inHdW"&gt;The electric Ranger is being designed and developed by Polaris and Zero at a facility in Wyoming, Minnesota, with manufacturing to take place at Polaris’ facility in Huntsville, Alabama. The first vehicles are expected to roll out to dealerships early next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes admits that she was CEO of Theranos, the company she founded</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jcn4AcuxIxZEOw5p-G1S6Me_r8=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70213083/1236914484.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘The buck stops with you?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nXqFyi"&gt;No one was more invested in Theranos than CEO and founder Elizabeth Holmes, she testified today. She owned the most stock. She could even fire the entire board of directors — and basically anyone else at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xykpPo"&gt;“Is that fair?” Prosecutor Robert Leach asked Holmes in his cross-examination. “The buck stops with you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn4Yru"&gt;“I felt that,” Holmes replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBWopP"&gt;Holmes’ defense has mostly tried to lay blame elsewhere — lab directors, her co-defendant Sunny Balwani (who is being tried separately), marketing firm Chiat Day, and more. Holmes, who is standing trial for 11 counts of wire fraud, portrayed herself as a true believer in Theranos’ technology who was largely unaware of Theranos’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxxFV4"&gt;In order to knock down that testimony, prosecutors got her to admit to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eBxyWJ"&gt;Knowing Theranos was in a precarious financial situation in late 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VPELbl"&gt;Altering the text of reports Theranos had written for drug companies, in addition to adding logos to them, before sending them to Walgreens, investors, and journalist Roger Parloff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2nreYh"&gt;Trying to control &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporter John Carreyrou’s experience at a Theranos wellness center and attempting to kill his story by emailing the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, who happened to be a Theranos investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NqNbWw"&gt;Sending the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner after Carreyrou’s sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NDrn9t"&gt;Having lawyers review the language on Theranos’ website, then ignoring their suggestions in slide decks presented to investors afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ubvj9S"&gt;Asking Balwani to leave the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPI0mr"&gt;Cash rules everything around me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="muAv2P"&gt;Today, jurors stared deeply at an Excel sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bgeSn"&gt;In August 2013, Theranos was running out of money. The company had to repay money to Blue Cross Blue Shield because Theranos hadn’t satisfied the conditions of a contract. On the week of September 23, 2013, Theranos had about $14.5 million left in free cash. The company had an intense burn rate and was nearly out of money, prosecutor Leach suggested. “I never thought of it like that,” Holmes replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBeZdN"&gt;A week later, Theranos raised $21.9 million from investors, but the cash crunch hadn’t ended. In December 2013, Balwani texted Holmes to warn her that they were down to $15 million in free cash. “I saw that,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vF87F"&gt;Motive established: Theranos needed money, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QsGXcq"&gt;A little editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gEPbaP"&gt;In her direct testimony, Holmes admitted that she’d added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;logos to the reports&lt;/a&gt; Theranos prepared for drug companies before sending them to Walgreens, investors, and others. Earlier in the trial, we heard testimony that these recipients thought the logos meant that the reports hadn’t been prepared by Theranos. During her direct exam, Holmes said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799756/elizabeth-holmes-pfizer-logo-confession"&gt;adding those logos was an honest mistake&lt;/a&gt;, and she only wanted to convey the partnership. She said she regretted that people had been fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWReme"&gt;Today, we were shown excerpts of Theranos’ contracts with drug companies that &lt;em&gt;expressly forbid&lt;/em&gt; use of their logos without prior written permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AjfS0f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The logos weren’t all that changed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUfqY7"&gt;But the logos weren’t all that changed. Snippets of text that might have made it easier to figure out the report was made &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Pfizer instead of &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;Pfizer was removed by Holmes. On a memo Holmes added a Schering-Plough logo to, some of the language in its conclusion section was changed to be even more flattering to Theranos. Asked if she regretted it, she was defiant: “I think this was accurately reflecting the data in the document,” Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrzNjF"&gt;One document she sent out &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come from a drug company — it was an analysis from GlaxoSmithKline. It, too, had been altered. The original, sent from GSK to Theranos, was a word document with no logo. Holmes added the logo. Someone also deleted one of the report’s conclusions, a bullet point that said “finger prick/blood draw procedure was difficult (needed larger lancet and better syringe system).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbmekI"&gt;Did Holmes make this deletion? She said she didn’t know. She didn’t know who at Theranos might have made those changes to the documents, she said. I found this difficult to believe, particularly since she’d owned some other changes on those documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ly9BuC"&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Md4Nz3"&gt;When Theranos got wind of &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Carreyrou’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;investigation into the company,&lt;/a&gt; Holmes and Balwani exchanged texts about him. They’d hired a firm, Fusion GPS, to do “oppo.” “Our oppo guy knows him well,” she texted Balwani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eftXEK"&gt;“We’’ll get [a] killer package for when [we] meet with Carreyrou to turn this into our story,” she texted Balwani later. On the stand, Holmes said she didn’t know if that was a reference to work with Fusion GPS, but I honestly don’t know what else it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="78CADp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She appealed to a major Theranos investor: Rupert Murdoch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1RD0k"&gt;“Need to get ahead of all of it,” Holmes texted Balwani. Holmes was shown this text and asked if she remembered she was trying to get ahead of the story. She said it didn’t refresh her memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAq4Gf"&gt;The attempts to control Carreyrou’s reporting didn’t stop there. Holmes and Balwani texted about Carreyrou’s plans to visit a Theranos wellness center and debated whether they should intervene to make sure he didn’t get a fingerstick test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2hH7p"&gt;Then, just for fun, we read some texts where Balwani and Holmes mocked Carreyrou for being French. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SCH0A"&gt;When Holmes’ attempts to kill Carreyrou’s stories didn’t work, she appealed to a major Theranos investor: Rupert Murdoch. (Murdoch owns the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;and, incidentally, is the inspiration for the menacing patriarch Logan Roy on the excellent television show &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She emailed him, with a document attached, trying to get him to broker a meeting between a senior &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; staffer and Theranos’ lawyers. “I’ve also attached the material Theranos has shared with &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; (responsive to questions from John Carreryrou) since the materials I gave you in July…. I thought that were I in your shoes I would want to know/be in the loop,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1qhjp"&gt;Holmes did not succeed in killing Carreyrou’s story. Shortly after it ran, she went on Jim Cramer’s show, &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;/em&gt;, to deny its central claims — so we watched the clip in court. “Every test we run on our laboratory can run on our proprietary devices,” Holmes told Cramer. This was not true — only 12 tests, even fewer than the 15 Carreyrou initially reported, ran on Theranos devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwFtyS"&gt;Holmes was motionless as she watched the video, except for occasionally pressing her lips together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OgpERH"&gt;Retaliation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz7H4o"&gt;In Holmes’ and Balwani’s efforts to get ahead of the story, Balwani tried to figure out who Carreyrou’s sources were. “Down to 5 people. We’ll nail this motherfucker,” Balwani texted Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cmo367"&gt;“Who do u think,” she replied. “Now we have legal grounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7Soux"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Theranos will consider all appropriate remedies, including filing suit against you.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLg6ZE"&gt;Asked about this in court, Holmes claimed — not especially convincingly — that she and Balwani were talking about who’d left Theranos some bad reviews on Glassdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo4D9o"&gt;Balwani texted Holmes, correctly, that Carreyrou’s sources were “Tyler [Shultz], Erika [Cheung] and Adam [Rosendorff].” Holmes didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;ask who Cheung was,&lt;/a&gt; though they’d barely interacted. In fact,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt; the issues Cheung raised &lt;/a&gt;were the same ones regulators later found in the Theranos lab, Holmes admitted. “I sure as hell wish we treated her differently,” Holmes said of Cheung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATEcQe"&gt;Cheung was tailed and served with a threatening letter from Theranos’ lawyers, Boies Schiller. The letter instructed her to “cease and desist from these activities…. Theranos will consider all appropriate remedies, including filing suit against you.” Holmes denied that this was threatening and said she was only trying to protect trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxSMtn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-whistleblower-shook-the-companyand-his-family-1479335963"&gt;Shultz was surprised at his grandfather’s house&lt;/a&gt; by Boies Schiller lawyers, though Holmes denied she’d meant to “ambush” him. Shultz’s grandfather, George, was also a Holmes mentor and sat on her board of directors. He called her, angrily, about the ambush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qs2PNf"&gt;“Better”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BVNbVR"&gt;In 2013, Holmes hired a lawyer to review Theranos’ marketing materials just before the Walgreens launch. “I haven’t quite worked my way through the whole website, but I’m worried,” the lawyer emailed Holmes. “For example, every time you say ‘better’ without specifying what it is better than, you are making a comparative claim, at least to all market leaders. You must be able to substantiate these claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJ8aHx"&gt;We saw a proposed list of language changes: replacing “highest quality” with “high quality,” “highest levels of accuracy” with “high levels of accuracy,” and “more precise” to “precise.” Lawyers also suggested making sure Holmes substantiated several claims on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WeeLVM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems she ignored the lawyers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKfvHm"&gt;But when she wanted more money from investors, it seems she ignored the lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzyuBk"&gt;About three months later, Holmes sent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;PFM Management’s Bryan Grossman&lt;/a&gt; a Powerpoint presentation. “Theranos provides the highest level of oversight, automation and standardization,” one slide said. Another said Theranos tests had the  “highest levels of accuracy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkHeap"&gt;Around the same time, Lisa Peterson — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;who worked for the DeVos family office&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately led an investment in Theranos— received a Powerpoint said that Theranos’ high-complexity lab “requires the highest level of training.” It also contained information about Theranos’ proficiency testing, but didn’t mention that testing all took place on conventional machines. Holmes said she didn’t remember discussing the slide, but that she didn’t mention modified conventional machines with any investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aTIw84"&gt;Balwani texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ekDqRV"&gt;We saw a lot of texts between Holmes and Balwani. The least successful use of those texts was to try to cast doubt on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22809049/elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud"&gt;Holmes’ claims that Balwani abused her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcsEM8"&gt;The prosecution delved into Holmes and Balwani’s relationship, bringing Holmes to tears on the stand twice. Though he hadn’t told her to lie to investors or anyone else, she said that his treatment affected “everything about who I was.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XTVFk7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think I was asking permission to see my friends.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uU7nBf"&gt;That seemed particularly evident when she testified that, despite being Balwani’s boss at Theranos, she had to get his approval to live her life. In one text, she asked him if it would be okay for her to see friends in the morning, as long as she was home by 11AM. “I think I was asking permission to see my friends,” Holmes said. “I often tried to ask him if it would be okay if I could see a friend before going to the office or going to a work meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfsLHP"&gt;“Do you know how many times the word ‘love’ appears in these texts?” Leach asked. She did not, but said she wasn’t surprised to hear it was 594 times. He then instructed her to read some tender exchanges to the court. Mixed in with the affection was business, as when Balwani texted her that he was “worried about your ‘all fingersticks on our technology comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuHdUv"&gt;It was hard to tell what the jury made of all this, though I saw a few jurors shifting in their seats during this segment of testimony. It turned my stomach — and gave the defense a serious opening to challenge the prosecution’s overreach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkZ27R"&gt;Some of Holmes’ testimony did actually bolster the prosecution’s case. She said she sometimes gave Balwani direction, that he was an at-will employee, and that she could have fired him at any time. As for his exit at Theranos, “I asked him to leave,” Holmes said. She said that her disillusionment with him after a lab audit turned up lots of problems was part of what prompted her to end their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2hkUfd"&gt;Who is Elizabeth Holmes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="agDC2w"&gt;The portrait painted on the cross-examination showed a CEO who was in control of her company, and who was actively working to make sure that its presentation to the world was what she wanted it to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFpoXS"&gt;On direct examination, we were told that Holmes was young and naive. She’d made some mistakes, sure, but she’d also delegated to a lot of experts. Besides, those mistakes weren’t really criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rcNRy"&gt;Today we saw someone else — someone who was in firm control of Theranos and wanted to make its story larger than life. We saw memos Holmes doctored to make Theranos more appealing. We read her texts and emails, where she tried to kill an unflattering news story. She also tried to punish the story’s sources when she couldn’t get to the reporter. Despite hiring lawyers to review her language, she ignored their advice when she made investor presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7MCmAA"&gt;The jury will soon decide whether Holmes is guilty of fraud. What’s no longer up for debate? She was pulling the strings at Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is selling ugly Windows sweaters again, and this time, it’s Minesweeper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6MTwvIZyRFLnDl90nToW4trz_w=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212345/Downloads_TeamsBackgrounds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jSDoGm"&gt;Microsoft has launched a new Windows software-themed ugly sweater on its &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/windows"&gt;Xbox Gear Shop&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the infamous Windows game &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd2Ed1"&gt;It’s well done: not only is the whole &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; level shaped like a Christmas tree, but it’s also got mines masquerading as snowflakes and “buttons” to minimize the window or exit the game if you so desire, plus the classic wavy Windows logo that hearkens back to Windows 3.1. (If you’re wondering why the sweater has “1990” remaining mines, that’s a reference to the year &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; first came out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FCEnxn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Whatchu know about Minesweeper? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UglyChristmasSweater?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UglyChristmasSweater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsUglySweater?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsUglySweater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nWnn42uyw2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nWnn42uyw2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1465452689974861826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T5GNSb"&gt;This is Microsoft’s second year of Windows-themed ugly sweaters. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21779499/microsoft-windows-ugly-sweater-paint-xp-95-girls-who-code"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, the company released three ugly sweater designs, including one garment based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512247/microsoft-paint-windows-10-app-comments"&gt;timeless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;MS Paint&lt;/em&gt; application, which humorously looked as if it were designed in that very app. In 2020, Microsoft donated a portion of the proceeds from each sweater to Girls Who Code; this year, the company appears to be giving a lump sum of $100,000 to the &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.networkforgood.com/projects/82475-the-ablegamers-charity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/em&gt; charity&lt;/a&gt; for gamers with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiBCW6"&gt;Microsoft is selling the &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; ugly sweater for the explosive price of $74.99 — $5 more expensive than last year’s designs. The sweaters &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-microsoft-paint-holiday-sweaters-2020-12"&gt;sold out in 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; last year with a late December restock, so if you want to look like a pro at flagging mines this holiday, then &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/microsoft-windows-minesweeper-sweater"&gt;get one soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Edge users aren’t happy about Microsoft’s built-in ‘buy now, pay later’ tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8LbkY2zGtKz8MzRxB44-oL8l_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212337/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kB5NU"&gt;Microsoft is tacking on a “buy now, pay later” extension to Edge that prompts users to use short-term financing service &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzip.co%2Fus&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F30%2F22810595%2Fmicrosoft-edge-zip-buy-now-pay-later" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zip&lt;/a&gt; (formerly QuadPay) when making a purchase on the browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SR1VEb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The option to sign up and use Zip will appear on checkout pages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M2KKE5"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2967030"&gt;company introduced the service&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and now some users are reportedly seeing it integrated into their browsers after updating to Edge version 96, as noted by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/11/microsoft-plans-to-integrate-a-buy-now-pay-later-app-into-edge/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The option to sign up and use Zip will be displayed on checkout pages, appearing in the same area where you’d enter your credit card number on Edge (or access a previously used one), and will sometimes be ingrained in the checkout page itself. Zip will pop up when Edge detects that your purchase costs between $35 and $1,000, the price range that the service can cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HVZhY"&gt;While Zip lets you make purchases without spending anything upfront, this comes in exchange for four interest-free payments over a six-week period. Even still, the service technically isn’t free — it charges $1 for every payment you make, meaning you’ll end up spending $4 more on your purchase, no matter the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPDNp5"&gt;Edge will give you the option to pay through Zip by default, whether the store even offers the option or not. On a &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge-4f7db926-7bc8-4a9e-bd2d-d0831bc3038f"&gt;Microsoft support&lt;/a&gt; page, the company indicates that merchants will actually have to contact Microsoft if they don’t want customers using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwzTO0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft added Buy Now Pay Later into Edge (and so Windows 10 and 11 base OS), a thing which is known to be abused to harm people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tags on the post on Microsoft’s website say it all. Keep speaking out. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wsujv2VdWN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wsujv2VdWN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1465613506376613894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2rbmhj"&gt;The feature has come under heavy criticism, with some users upset about the extra bloatware &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2980646/highlight/true#M6061"&gt;slowing down their browsing experience&lt;/a&gt; and others concerned about the &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2978607/highlight/true#M6050"&gt;potential financial ramifications&lt;/a&gt; on users, especially for those who struggle to manage their credit. “Buy now, pay later” services have also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/criminals-exploit-buy-now-pay-later-services-like-klarna-and-afterpay.html"&gt;been a target for criminals&lt;/a&gt;, who can exploit them to score free goods, as they typically don’t check credit scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfP5wE"&gt;Plus, Edge already has built-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575038/microsoft-edge-coupons-promo-codes-feature-pdf-annotation-screenshot-inking"&gt;promo code and coupon alerts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;product price comparisons&lt;/a&gt; that pop up while you’re shopping. Microsoft even goes out of its way to explain that it doesn’t collect a fee for using Zip, so it’s unclear why the company is opting both buyers and sellers into an offer no one asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon faces new pressure over COVID protections in warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protesters Strike On Essentials Workers Rights Outside An Amazon Facility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xECE2lm1DJCU5h7cXklT-9k7H8o=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212230/1211474779.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon workers protested outside a warehouse last year | Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DtAefE"&gt;Amazon is facing new questions over failed COVID protections in its fulfillment centers, spurred on by New York Attorney General Letitia James. After more than a year of protests from workers and inquiries from legislators, James is now seeking a court order to require Amazon to appoint a monitor to oversee health and safety measures at its warehouse on Staten Island. As part of the same motion, James asked the company to reinstate fired worker Christian Smalls, who led public protests against Amazon last year, accusing the company of failing to keep employees from contracting the virus at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgSbGP"&gt;According to James, Amazon has rolled back many of its health and safety measures at the warehouse, known as JFK8. The Staten Island warehouse, which employs roughly 5,000 people, has been the site of an ongoing tug of war between Amazon and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J18lhp"&gt;“Amazon and its leadership banked billions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as the crisis rages on, the health and concerns of the workers continue to be ignored,” James &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-seeks-emergency-relief-protect-rights-and-safety-amazon"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Amazon must guarantee a work environment that promotes safety, transparency, and respect for its hardworking employees, not one that further endangers them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftQV0Z"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;Amazon pre-emptively sued the New York AG’s office&lt;/a&gt;, saying the office lacked the legal authority to demand legal remedies for the company’s handling of COVID-19 conditions at JFK8. James’ office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;filed suit against the company&lt;/a&gt; four days later, alleging Amazon failed to protect its warehouse employees in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and retaliated against workers who raised concerns about what they viewed as insufficient safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGYSa"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s JKF8 warehouse said in March 2020 that they didn’t have enough &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; and were not informed if their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;co-workers tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BZmus8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Warehouse workers are forcing Amazon to take COVID-19 seriously","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XJ6PIL"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice"&gt;fired several workers who protested&lt;/a&gt; the conditions, including Smalls, after the workers staged public protests. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/technology/amazon-coronavirus-whistleblowers.html"&gt;Amazon said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that Smalls and the other workers were not fired for protesting but for violating social distancing rules. James sought an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board, calling Smalls’ firing “disgraceful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gkiXm"&gt;James says in the latest motion, filed in New York’s state Supreme Court, that Amazon “unlawfully fired and disciplined workers who reported their concerns about the company’s compliance with these health and safety mandates, including Christian Smalls.” James is also seeking a court order to reinstate Smalls on an interim basis, pending the outcome of the lawsuit. The suit claims Smalls’ firing served as intimidation to other employees who may be afraid to come forward with additional concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1goff"&gt;James also alleges that Amazon violated state law when it failed to conduct adequate cleaning protocols, according to an investigation by her office, and that its contact tracing program failed to identify workers who had come into contact with others who tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKyDFS"&gt;The motion asks the court to order Amazon to change how it monitors employees’ productivity to allow time for cleaning and social distancing and require the company to adopt adequate disinfection protocols when an infected worker has been in the facility. The AG’s office also wants the company to institute better COVID-19 contact tracing protocols, which would include notifying close contacts of infected workers. The suit seeks to have a court-appointed monitor oversee these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTl1yD"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had incurred more than $15 billion in costs as part of a “comprehensive approach to COVID-19 safety” measures, to support customers and employees. “It’s disappointing that the Attorney General is seeking to politicize the pandemic by asking for ‘emergency’ relief now despite having filed this lawsuit nine months ago,” Nantel continued, adding that the company had “listened to and learned from the experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzpCJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: November 30th 7:11 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Amazon spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip is here to power the Android flagships of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FP9dyJyaIVdY_TvNUruvjV_Cx0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212202/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuNSYq"&gt;Qualcomm has a new flagship smartphone processor: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, announced at the company’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit, giving an early preview at the brains behind the most powerful smartphones of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9IvvH"&gt;The successor to last year’s Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chipset to bear Qualcomm’s new naming scheme (which the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796541/qualcomm-snapdragon-branding-naming-scheme-changes-updates"&gt;previously teased last week&lt;/a&gt;), ditching the triple-digit numbering system that Qualcomm has previously used for new, generation-based monikers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB2M3v"&gt;As is the case every year, Qualcomm is promising some major improvements in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, with better performance, camera technology, AI capabilities, security, and 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2juAI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;20 percent better CPU performance and up to 30 percent CPU power efficiency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Od6QyN"&gt;Let’s start with the hard specs. As expected, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chip from Qualcomm to use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22448107/arm-armv9-architecure-cortex-x2-a710-cpu-mali-g710-gpu-android-2022-designs"&gt;latest Armv9 architecture from Arm&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new eight-core Kryo CPU will feature a single prime core based on the Cortex-X2 at 3.0GHz, along with three performance cores based on Cortex-A710 at 2.5GHz, and a quartet of efficiency cores based on the Cortex-A510 design at 1.8GHz. Additionally, the new chip jumps to a 4nm process, from the 5nm process on which the Snapdragon 888 was built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJ3LTB"&gt;All told, Qualcomm promises that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 will offer up to 20 percent better performance and up to 30 percent more power efficiency over last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYm24t"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Adreno GPU (much like the Gen 1’s Kryo CPU, Qualcomm didn’t give a specific number for the updated hardware here) promises to offer 30 percent faster graphics rendering, in addition to 25 percent better power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 888. It’ll also offer a new GPU control panel for fine-tuning how games are running on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4juexRZOAnmC4QbR2ZCXAq0eqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053637/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Block_Diagram.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OkrJfj"&gt;Making its debut on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274127/qualcomm-x65-5g-modem-10gbps-speeds-ai-tuning-software-updates"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 modem&lt;/a&gt;, which promises a whole suite of 5G features and firsts. As Qualcomm’s fourth-generation 5G modem, it builds on the existing mmWave and sub-6GHz compatibility that came before, adding support for up to 10Gbps speeds and the latest 3GPP Release 16 specification. As is always the case, you almost certainly won’t actually see that kind of speed in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5nkUO"&gt;The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth LE Audio (a first for Qualcomm), and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652655/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-announced-snapdragon-sound"&gt;company’s Snapdragon Sound technology&lt;/a&gt; for enabling AptX Lossless wireless audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wzUiT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;18-bit RAW photos and 8K HDR video — if your camera can handle it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bnlut"&gt;As is traditional for Qualcomm’s top-tier processor, the company is putting a big emphasis on its beefed-up camera capabilities, which the company is bundling together for the first time under a new “Snapdragon Sight” brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMw4vp"&gt;While the Spectra ISP is once again a triple ISP system, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 upgrades things up to an 18-bit system (up from 14 bits on the 888). That translates to 4,096 times more camera data and up to four additional stops of dynamic range for very bright or very dark scenarios. The triple ISP (image signal processor) also allows for things like shooting 240 12-megapixel photos in a single second or simultaneously shooting in 8K with HDR while snapping 64-megapixel stills thanks to an increased 3.2-gigapixel per second throughput.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxZitX"&gt;Qualcomm is also offering more high-end camera features out of the box, including support for shooting in 8K video with HDR 10 Plus and shooting in 18-bit RAW (assuming your phone has the camera hardware to actually pull it off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxU45a"&gt;The 8 Gen 1 also features a variety of other imaging improvements, including better dark mode pictures that can use data from up to 30 images in a single shot (up from six images on the 888). There’s also a host of better AI processing techniques, with improved auto-exposure, auto-focus, and auto-face detection technology, a dedicated “bokeh engine” for adding portrait effects to 4K video, and an “ultrawide engine” that can de-warp and remove chromatic aberrations from shots. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcfdqVR73HgJz6eUJCWh9VGLo2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053641/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Chip_Image.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3IESWU"&gt;Qualcomm is also adding a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; ISP, located in the dedicated sensing hub on the SoC: unlike the triple ISP for the primary camera, the new ISP is designed specifically to power an always-on camera that’s active at all times. Qualcomm has some big ambitions for what developers can do with the always-on camera, like automatically shutting off your screen when you put your phone down or if it detects someone trying to read over your shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR5cbn"&gt;And while the idea of an always-on camera raises some obvious security concerns, Qualcomm argues that the feature is intended to help make using your device &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; secure, with any camera data for the always-on camera staying locally on-device in the chip’s secure enclave. Additionally, customers will be able to opt in to using the always-on camera, much in the same way that they can choose whether to use an always-listening microphone feature for voice assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w34JYb"&gt;Still, though, the added capability — and how manufacturers implement it into their devices, if they do at all — will be something to watch when the first chips with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O377mH"&gt;On the AI side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 features Qualcomm’s latest Hexagon processor, with its seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is four times faster than its predecessor and up to 1.7 times more power efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wTFjT"&gt;The company showed off a variety of use cases that the boosted AI performance can enable, including the aforementioned camera functionality, a “Leica Leitz Look mode” that emulates Leica lens effects, and improved detection of where you’re holding your phone for optimizing antenna performance. Additionally, Qualcomm is adding AI-powered sampling to offer a DLSS-style effect for improving mobile games, something that it says will happen automatically when gaming on the 8 Gen 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VpVaCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four times better AI performance compared to last year’s model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyRwV5"&gt;Lastly, there are security improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 adds a new hardware-level layer of security with a “dedicated Trust Management Engine,” in addition to offering support for the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/security/android-ready-se"&gt;Android Ready SE standard&lt;/a&gt;, enabling support for digital car keys, driver’s licenses, IDs, and e-money wallets. There’s also built-in iSIM support for directly connecting to cellular networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9agPT"&gt;Despite the new branding, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 doesn’t appear to break the mold for Qualcomm’s chips, offering the usual generational upgrades we’ve come to expect from the company’s annual flagships. Still, in a world where bespoke chips like Google’s Tensor or Apple’s A-series processors are becoming increasingly popular, it’s good to see that Qualcomm has no intention of slowing the pace on its own top chips, even as the competition heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ouwCZ"&gt;And with the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 smartphones expected before the end of 2021, it won’t be long before we’ll be able to see just how powerful Qualcomm’s latest chip is for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will use machine learning to detect people evading bans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16eNsKt54O1UZ9ZhpX00mMGw_BQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211930/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="juAUUW"&gt;Twitch is furthering its efforts to reduce harassment with a new tool that uses machine learning to detect people who may be attempting to evade bans. It’s the company’s latest addition to combat things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;like hate raids&lt;/a&gt;, where streamers’ chats are overrun with trolls sending hateful messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnqbPd"&gt;The new tool, called Suspicious User Detection, can identify users as “likely” or “possible” people who have evaded bans from a streamer’s channel. The machine learning model powering the tool identifies potential evaders by evaluating things such as their behavior and characteristics about their account and compares that information against accounts that have been banned from a streamer’s channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igfhpf"&gt;Messages from “likely” evaders won’t be sent to chat, but streamers and their mods can see them. Streamers and mods can choose to monitor a likely ban evader, which adds that user to a monitoring list and puts a message next to a user’s name noting the monitoring (as shown in the GIF below), or ban them. “Possible” evaders’ messages &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; appear in chat, but streamers / mods can opt to have those messages blocked from chat as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SN_bbBfuej_qF3jmpQ8Js_cam4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053645/Untitled.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HWio0w"&gt;Twitch says it will turn Suspicious User Detection on by default, but streamers can tweak or turn off the tool if they want. Streamers and mods can also manually select to monitor users of whom they are suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlEph8"&gt;“This tool was inspired in large part by community feedback around the need for better ways to curb ban evaders,” Alison Huffman, Twitch’s director of product for community health, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When we were speaking with mods about their pain points, we heard that it can be hard to distinguish whether a user who chatted something that violated their channel’s norms was a harmful, repeat harasser or just a newer viewer who hadn’t learned that channel’s customs yet. As such, we designed this tool to give mods and creators more information about potential ban evaders so they could make more efficient and informed decisions within their channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LFFRt"&gt;Suspicious User Detection seems like it could make a difference in silencing hateful individuals, especially if used in tandem with recently introduced controls that let a streamer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700937/twitch-safety-tools-verification-phone-hate-raids"&gt;require phone or email verification&lt;/a&gt; for accounts participating in chat. But it remains to be seen how effective Suspicious User Detection actually will be in practice or if ban evaders can find ways to get around the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Quest update brings cloud backups and a mixed reality view</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2QxlZZ4jT5mnM0Ph-ULYtnWttH4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211792/akrales_200904_4160_0158.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vA50ax"&gt;Meta has delivered a new batch of features for Quest headsets &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fmixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an update rolling out today&lt;/a&gt;. The changes include cloud backups, a mixed reality camera mode, and other settings that round out the Quest’s already impressive feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QhHtn"&gt;I’m most excited about the cloud backups feature, which gives you a way to restore user-specific data to your apps, including game saves and headset settings, if you need to replace, update, or reset your Quest. This is one of those things that I’m surprised the Quest didn’t support already, and I found out the hard way that it didn’t a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, I’m glad that it’s here now. It can be activated within the “Device” tab in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Quest mixed reality camera for Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FNeHizDsPGOHld4n_TnPN2CKSxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053421/mixedrealitycamera.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nilr6D"&gt;The mixed reality camera also seems really cool. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440683/oculus-v29-live-overlay-mixed-reality-capture-mic-files-app"&gt;Live Overlay feature that arrived in v29&lt;/a&gt; that imposed your body over a first-person view of a game or app, the new feature lets you see yourself interacting in the game world from a third-person perspective, as seen through your phone’s camera. The GIF provided by Meta that we’ve embedded shows what the end result can look like. You’ll be able to see yourself in &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for example,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;striking blocks and dodging obstacles. Meta says that a dozen apps support the feature, including &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Superhot VR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Synth Riders&lt;/em&gt;, but a total of just six &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/mobile-mixed-reality-camera?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update"&gt;were listed at this page&lt;/a&gt; at the time of publishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5hu4J"&gt;To use the mobile mixed reality camera feature, you need an iPhone XS or newer, running iOS 11 or higher. Support for Android phones and tablets was erroneously included in Meta’s support page for the feature, but it has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDUm7c"&gt;The new software also changes where you’ll enable multiuser support, the feature that lets you add multiple Facebook accounts to the headset, and app sharing, which lets you share paid apps among those profiles. They were previously nested within the “experimental features” settings tab, but both are moving to the “Accounts” section of the settings menu. This new v35 software also lays the groundwork for using Messenger to make voice calls while you have the headset on, as well as adding new cosmetic items that can be used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;, Meta’s take on a VR office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjx3JB"&gt;The last note in Meta’s blog on the latest Quest software is that it now has a public test channel for its upcoming software. &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/using-your-headset/quest-ptc?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update"&gt;You can sign up for it here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to test new features earlier than the rest of us — although Meta says that you won’t be able to leave it after you join until a new public software update is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QG8AMj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Will the Oculus Quest still require a Facebook account? It’s complicated ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751297/meta-oculus-quest-need-facebook-account-login-password"},{"title":"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is coming to Oculus Quest 2...at some point","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751009/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-oculus-quest-2"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PXIYGv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: Meta told The Verge that its list of devices that are compatible with its new mobile mixed reality camera feature, which included support for all Android tablets and phones, was incorrect, and has been updated. We’ve updated our post to reflect the changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
