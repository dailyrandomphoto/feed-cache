    <title>Facebook adds a path to partnership for its Level Up creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfIiMIsHT-Yu9oNuvKDxvCM0xcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942912/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aKsdpL"&gt;Facebook Gaming has announced a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/622800001735064"&gt;path to partnership&lt;/a&gt; for streamers in its Level Up creators program, which is the site’s equivalent of Twitch’s affiliates. It’s pretty grueling, and eligibility isn’t judged on the same metrics as its Level Up program, which allows streamers to start monetizing their broadcasts. Partners, however, get a slew of benefits, including a direct line to Facebook’s support team, a private Facebook Gaming community group, partner-only invites to Facebook Gaming events, a partner badge, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2478459059124998"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFksB5"&gt;Streamers in the Level Up program, on the other hand, are able to monetize their streams with Facebook Stars, a site currency, and fan subscriptions; they also get features like high-quality transcoding (i.e., 1080p 60fps streams) and access to beta products and features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YihCPU"&gt;To be eligible for the Level Up program, gaming creators on Facebook have to stream games for four hours in the prior two weeks on at least two separate days in that same period. They also need at least 100 followers on a page that’s been active for more than two weeks. The admin of said page needs to be older than 18. These metrics are pretty reasonable and just about comparable to Twitch’s program metrics for its affiliate program (reach 50 followers, stream for eight hours on seven different days, with an average of three viewers in a one-month period). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SoqBHh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eligibility for Facebook Gaming’s partnership program is judged on “engaged followers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuqRQj"&gt;Eligibility for Facebook Gaming’s partnership program, on the other hand, is judged on “engaged followers” — Facebook’s way of tracking the people who regularly return to your stream — and Stars revenue. To be considered for the partnership program, a gaming creator needs to have 3,000 engaged followers and earn $2,000 (200,000 stars) in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lt1wAU"&gt;Twitch’s partnership program has different requirements: streamers must broadcast for 25 hours on 12 different days with an average of 75 viewers in a month. It also has a reputation for being notoriously difficult to achieve. Those metrics seem fairly reasonable on their face, but in practice, it’s hard to hit those numbers &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;get Twitch to approve your application. &lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; streamers apply more than once before making it into &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/partners/faq/"&gt;the 27,000-strong club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK8wFK"&gt;What’s most interesting about Facebook’s partnership requirements is that they didn’t have a clear path to being verified as a gaming creator on the site before; it’s also fascinating that there are just two requirements, and one is tied explicitly to how much money a creator earns on the site. ($2,000 works out to about 200,000 bits or 800 $5 subscriptions — Twitch takes a 50 percent cut.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x46EHM"&gt;A spokesperson for Facebook Gaming told me in an email that more than 2,000 creators earn at least $1,000 a month on the site, though they presumably are including the current slate of Facebook Gaming partners — streamers like Cory “King Gothalion” Michael, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936859/mixer-twitch-king-gothalion-shroud-ninja"&gt;who left Twitch for an exclusive Mixer deal&lt;/a&gt; in October 2019 and who then moved to Facebook Gaming after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21300245/mixer-failed-microsoft-social-media-instagram-streaming"&gt;Mixer shut down&lt;/a&gt; — in those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJrdOf"&gt;Some Level Up streamers will absolutely hit Facebook’s numbers for partnership immediately, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the requirements become less onerous over time. After all, back in 2015, streamers on Twitch used to have to average more than 500 concurrents a stream to be considered for partnership. As one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/382yab/twitchs_very_high_requirement_to_be_a_partner/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; from that era lamented: “500... 500 viewers on average, every time you stream. This seems an almost impossibility? Anyone had experience with twitch partnering?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXk9Z0"&gt;While they still stream — and cast and produce &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; tournaments — they still haven’t made partner. It’s important to remember that the creator economy is just as unequal as the real one. By Twitch’s own count, there are now around 27,000 partners on its site. &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/partners/faq/"&gt;But that’s out of 2,000,000 other active broadcasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fjJsw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWJ2rT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taDk8x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJudr1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kia releases teaser images of its next electric car, the EV6</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4Q0dQrFUXqlYIjJ1FH6BWSIBbc=/0x27:620x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942902/kwcms_620x466_front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Kia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1OTpnL"&gt;Kia has given its next electric vehicle a name and is getting ready to pull the cover off the new car sometime within the next few weeks. Dubbed “EV6,” it’ll be the first electric vehicle that Kia is building on the new platform it’s sharing with parent company Hyundai — the same platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;Apple was reportedly interested in using&lt;/a&gt; to power... whatever it’s building before talks with the Korean automakers broke down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIJegZ"&gt;Kia released a few images of the car viewed off-angle from the sides, which reveal that the EV6 has a sort of hatchback-style shape. There’s a close-up image of a taillight, which appears to run across the entire rear of the car — a choice that’s becoming quite common in electric vehicle designs. Kia &lt;a href="https://www.kia.com/eu/about-kia/ev6/"&gt;also released a video with shots&lt;/a&gt; of the taillight illuminating, as well as one of the EV6’s headlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yr2zmd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10384503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dayVyp"&gt;The EV6 is the second electric vehicle to be recently announced that’s being built on the shared platform, which is called E-GMP. The other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;was Hyundai’s Ioniq 5&lt;/a&gt;, which broke cover in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vtApEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hyundai’s electric Ioniq 5 crossover could be the ultimate camping companion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5zG5B1"&gt;Kia says the EV6 is also the first to use the company’s new naming convention for its electric cars, which will each be called “EV” and given a number corresponding to their place in the lineup. The EV6 is supposed to get a full reveal sometime in the first quarter of 2021, according to Kia, which means it’s likely right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Miami Heat suspends Meyers Leonard for using slur during Twitch stream</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I84eno"&gt;The Miami Heat has suspended Meyers Leonard indefinitely after he used an anti-Semitic slur during a Twitch stream on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jx8R43"&gt;“The Miami Heat vehemently condemns the use of any form of hate speech,” the NBA team wrote in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1369483385882689541"&gt;Twitter statement on Tuesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. “The words used by Meyers Leonard were wrong and we will not tolerate hateful language from anyone associated with our franchise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KIV389"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/f8rLKCkS5i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f8rLKCkS5i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1369483385882689541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zu1rcW"&gt;In a statement apologizing for his actions &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CMN-G35DdD9/"&gt;posted to Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, Leonard says he wasn’t aware of the meaning of the slur when he said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbIxkf"&gt;“While I didn’t know what the word meant at the time, my ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong,” he said. “I am now more aware of its meaning and I am committed to properly seeking out people who can help educate me about this type of hate and how we can fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="st8etE"&gt;The NBA also issued a statement, saying it “unequivocally condemns all forms of hate speech,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fnba%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F31034606%2Fnba-looking-miami-heat-center-meyers-leonard-use-anti-semitic-slur&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323294%2Fmiami-heat-suspend-meyers-leonard-slur-twitch-faze-clan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a spokesperson told ESPN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbDSYj"&gt;Twitch has suspended Leonard, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not allow the use of hateful slurs on Twitch,” Twitch said in a statement. “The safety of our community is our top priority, and per our guidelines we reserve the right to suspend any account for conduct that we determine to be inappropriate, harmful, or puts our community at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdEPW8"&gt;Other organizations have distanced themselves from Leonard as well. Gaming and esports organization FaZe Clan, which Leonard had &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fupdate%2Furn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6521800750388121605%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323294%2Fmiami-heat-suspend-meyers-leonard-slur-twitch-faze-clan" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;invested in&lt;/a&gt;, said on Tuesday evening that it had severed ties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2t4XvT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A statement from FaZe Clan. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ePo1NGEaN5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ePo1NGEaN5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Clan (@FaZeClan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeClan/status/1369435605034295302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pARAx"&gt;And sponsors Origin PC and Scuf Gaming, which are both owned by Corsair, have also said they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ORIGINPC/status/1369400143448006657"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScufGaming/status/1369400178109779986"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt; their working relationships with Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbDCwx"&gt;While stars saying inappropriate things on stream is relatively new territory for NBA players who dabble in streaming, it’s an unfortunately common problem for the biggest names on Twitch. Turner “Tfue” Tenney, for example, was suspended in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/faze-tfue-fortnite-twitch-banned-30-days-notvivid-934858"&gt;for using a racial slur on stream&lt;/a&gt;, though the platform did not take action when he said a different slur &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20849429/fortnite-streamer-tfue-racial-slur-twitch-silence"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; pro Daniel “Dubs” Walsh &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/news/fortnite-pro-dubs-banned-from-twitch-after-using-racial-slur"&gt;was banned&lt;/a&gt; from Twitch and suspended from FaZe Clan after saying a racial slur in February 2020. (He has since been reinstated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp2pOa"&gt;Other celebrities who have tried their hand at streaming have faced real-world consequences for hurtful language as well. NASCAR driver Kyle Larson was fired by his team in April for using the n-word &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21219793/nascar-kyle-larson-slur-iracing-suspended-sim-racing"&gt;during a sim racing stream&lt;/a&gt;, while musician Joel Zimmerman, who you might know as deadmau5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223380/deadmau5-joel-zimmerman-deletes-twitch-homophobic-slur-suspension-hateful-conduct-controversy"&gt;deleted his Twitch channel in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after he was suspended for saying homophobic slurs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox and PS5 game updates are bringing great choice to console gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loseIWK7NINEWsIc5JvT3B_s-4c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942777/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jx8RPW"&gt;The Xbox Series X / S and PS5 consoles haven’t even reached the six-month mark yet, but game modes that favor performance or visual quality are already common. It feels like not a week goes by without a game getting an update to allow players to pick between a demanding 4K resolution or sacrificing some resolution and quality for 60fps or even 120fps modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XJSaG"&gt;Last month, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260905/control-ps5-next-gen-hands-on-preview"&gt;big next-gen update was &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with modes for both performance and visual quality. Today, it’s &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/overwatch-retail-patch-notes-%E2%80%93-march-9-2021/593440"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; with choices&lt;/a&gt; that let you pick between a 120fps mode or resolution and visual quality. These updates have made us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;fall in love with old games&lt;/a&gt; or appreciate how much better they run on modern consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELXvOo"&gt;This emerging trend brings better choice to console gaming and pushes it closer to the wide range of options and modes that have been available on PC for years. During our review of the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, we noted that it felt like this trend was emerging, but I’m still surprised to see these game mode updates appear so frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="drZ0YB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The PS5 and Xbox Series X made us fall back in love with old games ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"},{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"PS5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ArBMUn"&gt;So why do these game modes matter? Moving from 30fps to 60fps is obviously a big deal that has been happening in console gaming for years now. It results in much smoother gameplay across a variety of titles, and it’s particularly noticeable in racing games or first-person shooters. Put simply, it makes games feel a lot different and can reduce input lag and improve how you end up playing a title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJaBvX"&gt;Being able to choose between all of the graphic options turned on or some visual settings disabled with better performance means you can play a game the way you want. If you want a more cinematic experience, turn on the resolution mode. If you want the buttery-smooth feel, turn on the frame rate mode. Some game developers have also introduced balanced modes, but the choices are always relatively simple compared to the myriad options in PC games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etTu6z"&gt;While most games are trying to target 60fps these days, the promise of ray tracing means the option to play how you want is increasingly important. Ray tracing delivers more realistic scenes in games, with real-time lighting and effects. It’s an addition to this generation that hasn’t been fully explored by developers yet, but it comes at a performance cost that means recent games like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; are having to run at 30fps. This is where performance modes and options can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dRQGTz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdbtOKQ1iLo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8DtsN"&gt;Insomniac Games has been quick to add new modes to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man Remastered&lt;/em&gt; on the PS5 to even let you enable ray tracing with a 60fps performance mode. While the game takes a resolution hit in scenes as a result, it’s far less noticeable than if you were running at 30fps instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xud3ED"&gt;Other console game updates are also targeting new 120fps modes. The jump from 60fps to 120fps might feel less significant for some, but I’d argue it’s equally important. It’s the type of change you’ll notice gradually, and if you switch back from 120fps to 60fps you’ll immediately feel the difference. It does require a compatible TV or monitor, though, so a lot of people are missing out right now. A surprising amount of games are offering 120fps support already, including big names like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgBY78"&gt;Hitting 120fps reliably means a sacrifice in resolution, so most games will not offer full 4K at 120fps on these consoles. If you have the right TV or monitor, the benefits of a 120fps mode are obvious for certain games. First-person shooters like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; feel more responsive, and input latency is reduced for racing games like &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt;. If your TV supports variable refresh rate (VRR), then the benefits are even clearer as you get smooth gameplay without screen tearing when the frame rate dips at these higher refresh rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M3cwjotOasX_lWgpzzpk6zewAFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21959023/dirt5modes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dirt 5&lt;em&gt;’s game modes.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vLOhxM"&gt;These new 120fps modes aren’t appearing equally, though. While the Xbox Series X offers more than 20 games with 120fps options, the PS5 has less than 10. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; all offer 120fps options on the Xbox side, but the PS5 support is lagging behind. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; developer Psyonix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579166/ps5-120fps-games-support-developer-rocket-league"&gt;revealed last year&lt;/a&gt; that enabling 120fps in Xbox games is a minor patch, but it requires a “full native port” for the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ctpaf"&gt;This gap is largely on existing popular cross-platform games, and it’s bound to be one we’ll see close as developers have more time to port games and work on modes. Sony is also planning to support VRR on the PS5 with a future update, and once that arrives it should spur developers on to support 120fps more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyRMTM"&gt;It’s been encouraging to witness the speed of game updates for these new consoles, though. We might still be waiting on next-gen games and actual stock of consoles, but once you’re able to purchase a new Xbox or PS5, the games you’re already playing will probably offer lots of these new modes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter tries to fix problematic image crops by not cropping pictures anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gOvrR0-X2nZdOI9bHzEx72IW3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68942725/akrales_180620_1777_0282.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HE8qby"&gt;Twitter has devised a potential solution to its problematic image cropping issue: no more cropping. The company said on Wednesday it’s now testing a “what you see is what you get” image preview within the tweet compose box and experimenting with displaying full-frame images. That way, images will show up in the Twitter timeline looking just as they did when the user was composing the tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPy8CD"&gt;“Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better,” the company wrote in its announcement tweet on the new feature test. Twitter also says its testing new 4K image uploading on Android and iOS as part of a broader push “to improve how you can share and view media on Twitter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gs69cb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing on Android and iOS: when you Tweet a single image, how the image appears in the Tweet composer is how it will look on the timeline –– bigger and better. &lt;a href="https://t.co/izI5S9VRdX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/izI5S9VRdX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680667886444548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh1e8t"&gt;With the new image preview change, there should be less algorithmic surprises — like the ones several users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;brought attention to last fall&lt;/a&gt; that showed how the company’s automated cropping tool quite often favored white faces over Black ones. In many of those cases, irregularly sized images shared on Twitter were automatically cropped behind the scenes using an AI-powered algorithm, but in ways that raised some troubling questions about how the software prioritized skin color and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k1sqTZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Trying a horrible experiment...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which will the Twitter algorithm pick: Mitch McConnell or Barack Obama? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bR1GRyCkia"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bR1GRyCkia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tony “Abolish ICE” Arcieri   (@bascule) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvAmEm"&gt;Twitter at the time said the neural network it uses for automated image cropping was tested for racial bias, and the company claims it found none. But it also admitted it needed to perform more analysis and refine its approach to avoid situations like this where even the appearance of bias was a possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaGZrA"&gt;“It’s clear that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll open source our work so others can review and replicate,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1307742267193532416"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Twitter communications lead Liz Kelley in the aftermath of the controversy going viral. “Just because a system shows no statistical bias, doesn’t mean it won’t cause harm.” Kelley said Twitter would rely “less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aPUBWa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;we are going to rely less on auto-cropping so more often the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet   =  &lt;/p&gt;— liz kelley (@lizkelley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lizkelley/status/1311796809652555776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 1, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjw06K"&gt;Twitter’s Parag Agrawal, the company’s chief technology officer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498619/twitter-image-cropping-update-racial-bias-machine-learning"&gt;later wrote a blog post delving into the issue at length&lt;/a&gt;, saying at the time that Twitter would be conducting “additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing” and that it was “committed to sharing our findings and... exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01NJCK"&gt;Now, it looks like Twitter’s proposed solution is here, at least in a test phase. While tweets in standard aspect ratios will be identical when previewed in the compose window and displayed in the timeline, Twitter’s design chief Dantley Davis says extra-wide or tall images will be center cropped for those included in the test. Twitter has not shared a concrete timeline for when this change may be pushed live for all users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAGrtv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With this test, we hope to learn if this new approach is better and what changes we need to make to provide a “what you see is what you get” experience for Tweets with images.&lt;/p&gt;— Dantley Davis (@dantley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1369682378730389506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L3fH5t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sezHhL"&gt;Toyota &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22187113/toyota-electric-vehicles-us-suv-debut-hybrids"&gt;announced earlier this year that it’s gearing up for the release of its first mass-market EVs&lt;/a&gt; for the US, but now it also appears ready to show off one for Europe as soon as next week, according to a new microsite launched Wednesday.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aykcKk"&gt;Called “X Prologue,” apparently, Toyota is merely showing a single headlight of the new electric vehicle beneath a countdown that ends on March 17th. There are no other details as of yet, save for how the hood appears to match the styling of Toyota’s other modern vehicles. There’s also an LED light bar that carries across the nose of the car — a design element that’s becoming increasingly popular in the electric vehicle space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09ovlx"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-teases-new-x-prologue-model-ahead-reveal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autocar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, Toyota had previously announced plans to reveal a Rav4-sized electric SUV aimed at the European market sometime in 2021, so it’s possible that could be what’s in store. Toyota declined to provide more information beyond &lt;a href="https://newsroom.toyota.eu/x-prologue--a-small-preview-of-whats-next/"&gt;this phenomenally sparse press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4bXA6"&gt;If it is indeed that vehicle, it will be the first one built on the EV platform Toyota has been co-developing with fellow Japanese automaker Subaru. The two automakers have (somewhat notoriously, to this point) hesitated to embrace all-electric vehicles, though they are planning to build multiple models on this new architecture. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 took disease tests out of the lab — and may keep them there</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It could help us be ready for the next pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qMNBaJ"&gt;Just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, medical technology company Lucira Health was starting to fine-tune its at-home flu test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNmcLu"&gt;“We found ourselves in January 2020 wondering, wow, we have this platform, should we be looking at COVID-19?” Kelly Brezoczky, executive vice president at Lucira Health, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the technology would transfer; it was just a matter of swapping in the coronavirus for the influenza virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILerrx"&gt;By November 2020, Lucira had the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-covid-19-test-self-testing-home"&gt;first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization&lt;/a&gt; for a fully at-home COVID-19 test. If the company had kept working on its flu test, Brezoczky says she’s not sure if it would have been on the market by then. “Our COVID-19 product leapfrogged our first product,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="V1ud6l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our COVID-19 product leapfrogged our first product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iVbnsf"&gt;Before the pandemic, small companies like Lucira and academic research labs were working on shrinking and speeding up tests that could diagnose someone’s viral infection by detecting a virus’s genetic material in a swab from their nose or throat. They wanted to make it possible for these highly accurate tests to be done in a doctor’s office, at the patient bedside, or at home. But for the most part, those systems were in early stages of development. Most of this kind of testing, known as molecular testing, still had to be done in a lab.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qt4nzx"&gt;Skyrocketing need for COVID-19 testing accelerated all of those nascent efforts. Suddenly, the federal government and private companies were investing millions, and the Food and Drug Administration was using emergency authorizations to get tests on the market. Experts long predicted that at-home testing could be the future, but the pandemic shortened the timeline to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCeEEV"&gt;“Overall, it was a very big opportunity,” says Paul Yager, a professor in the department of bioengineering at the University of Washington who works on rapid test development. “It sounds cynical, but a bad public health problem that gets everyone’s attention — and certainly this got everyone’s attention — pumps money into the field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4GV6Dn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jIrYmd"&gt;A year ago, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to accelerate in the United States, it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184015/coronavirus-testing-pcr-diagnostic-point-of-care-cdc-techonology"&gt;hard if not impossible&lt;/a&gt; for most people in the US to track down a coronavirus test. The country relied on a type of test called a PCR. PCR is the gold standard approach to identifying a virus. It looks for a snippet of the virus’s genetic material in a swab collected from a patient. That’s why it’s also called a molecular test: it searches out a genetic molecule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2egkyu"&gt;Molecular tests are very different from another kind of viral test called an &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/rapid-antigen-covid19-tests-unreported/617668/"&gt;antigen test&lt;/a&gt;. Antigen tests look for a protein on the surface of the virus rather than the molecular code of the virus itself. They are cheap and fast, but they can be less accurate than molecular tests like PCR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXnNQCkFwaIsp9FlkqLXgANpo3M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22359539/device__box_and_instructions.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucira Health&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z2EQCY"&gt;PCR is typically a good approach: it’s extremely accurate and easy to develop against new viruses. However, it’s finicky, takes training to handle the samples, and requires bulky, energy-sucking, expensive equipment. It’s usually run in hospitals or centralized labs. It also takes a few hours to run. During a health emergency, a few hours is too slow. And when cases spike and labs get a flood of samples, people may have to wait days to get their results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpNgk6"&gt;A faster test in those situations could make a huge difference in public health officials’ ability to track down infections and cut off the spread of disease. But until the pandemic hit, there hadn’t been significant investment or focus on creating faster, simpler molecular tests. It didn’t seem as necessary. “[Rapid testing] was more on the fringes, because our normal laboratory setup in the United States was already robust,” says Jacqueline Linnes, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Purdue University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjldmq"&gt;Small companies and academic research labs were still interested in creating those types of systems and made significant progress on the science and technology behind them. They figured out how to make gene detection energy efficient and cut down the number of steps needed to get a result. They also worked to make them easier to use by people without specialized training. But they didn’t attract interest from big companies that could push them to market at scale, Linnes says. “It was an academic exercise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xFBlSL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was an academic exercise”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9cPPDy"&gt;Yager, for example, had a small molecular test that could be applied to multiple types of diseases ready in 2017. But he couldn’t get a company to work with him to commercialize the product. “It was the commercial market that actually caused the project — which was technically successful — to fail,” he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21184015/coronavirus-testing-pcr-diagnostic-point-of-care-cdc-techonology"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lfXwD8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of the lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="45dshp"&gt;The pandemic upended that pattern. Suddenly, there was funding for and commercial interest in rapid testing. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx"&gt;Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics&lt;/a&gt; (RADx) initiative, which funded the development of new testing technologies for COVID-19. The pandemic was a public health emergency, so the FDA cleared tests under Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), which allows tests to be used after shorter examination periods than usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGa8ke"&gt;“We found out that industry has all of the resources and all of the know-how to make this stuff happen — if only they have the motivation,” Linnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQUbR2"&gt;Because researchers and small startups had already been working on rapid tests, some were able to take the same approach as Lucira and swap out their original target for the coronavirus. Visby Medical had originally developed a rapid sexually transmitted infection test, but it quickly started work on a rapid COVID-19 test that &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-radx-initiative-advances-six-new-covid-19-testing-technologies"&gt;was funded through the NIH’s program&lt;/a&gt;. It got authorization in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UrX2I39hnZ9aAUxbnnhljpnHFP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22359545/VisbyPersonalPCR_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Visby Medical&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vt4ZUP"&gt;The FDA authorized the first rapid molecular tests, made by the medical technology companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21191055/rapid-coronavirus-test-hospital-fda"&gt;Cepheid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/28/21197944/coronavirus-test-fast-doctors-office-abbott-fda"&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, in March 2020. Both can be used in health centers, nursing homes, or urgent care clinics close to patients. They take a specialized machine, but samples don’t have to be sent out to a lab. Many rapid tests use that approach: they have to be done by medical professionals but right at the location where patients get swabbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbKsJp"&gt;Visby’s test falls into that category. It has a single-use cartridge that can be used in environments like nursing homes and some schools. Eventually, Visby hopes its tests can be used at home, says Adam de la Zerda, founder and CEO of Visby Medical. The FDA has already cleared a handful of at-home COVID-19 tests, including Lucira’s. Last week, the agency authorized another at-home molecular test from the medical technology company Cue. Unlike Lucira, Cue’s test doesn’t require a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FsmMIL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s generally the direction that the FDA went”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cNDl8T"&gt;Yager thinks there will be more of a push for at-home testing. “They’re not all approved for home use yet, but that’s generally the direction that the FDA went — and I think it’s a trend,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ijm7PI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of diagnostics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yzr1SP"&gt;Rapid molecular tests are still only available in extremely limited quantities. Lucira is still scaling its production lines, and Cue hasn’t announced when its COVID-19 test could be on shelves. But they’ll be more and more available over the next year and could usher in a new approach to disease testing overall. “Today the model is that you schlep your way over to a hospital, or stand in a long line in a waiting room, and it takes a day. That’s not the way we want to go forward,” Yager says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3mPnA"&gt;The increased interest and money in rapid molecular testing is already making a huge difference for smaller companies and academic labs. Lucira became a &lt;a href="https://www.360dx.com/business-news/home-infectious-disease-test-developer-lucira-health-goes-public-17-share#.YEexopNKjlw"&gt;publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt; in February and is worth over $400 million. That raised a lot of eyebrows, Yager says. “The fact that there’s now a game for the investors to get into is a very exciting thing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H7DJQD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The fact that there’s now a game for the investors to get into is a very exciting thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BajAHH"&gt;Moving disease testing out of the lab would make diagnoses for diseases other than COVID-19 easier. It would also help people start treatment early. There are treatments for the flu, for example, that work well — but only if people start them within a day or two of feeling symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta04xu"&gt;Normally, most people don’t go to the doctor in that window, says Lucira’s Brezoczky. That’s what Lucira’s flu test — which the company is still planning to launch — aimed to help with, she says. If people could buy an accurate test when they went out to buy cough medicine, they’d be able to know if antivirals would help. “Then, you actually have a chance to reduce both duration and severity of symptoms,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P53zix"&gt;Visby also hopes to get clearance for its sexually transmitted infection test this year. Like the flu, those types of conditions are easier to treat if they’re caught early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeWw4O"&gt;Rapid molecular tests are still expensive, Linnes says. Lucira’s COVID-19 test is &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2021/at-home-covid-tests.html"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;. Cue hasn’t set a price for its newly authorized at-home molecular test. At this point, the price of these tests might be too high for regular cold and flu season use. But eventually, mass production and broader use could lower the price and help them become more commonplace, Linnes says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBZ0SF"&gt;Apart from price, a big advantage of scaling rapid molecular test manufacturing would be building a foundation for the next public health emergency. If the tests were in regular use for more ordinary viruses, it would be easier to adjust them to test for a pandemic virus, Linnes says. The US wouldn’t be as reliant on the slower in-lab PCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4xByqJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The US wouldn’t be as reliant on the slower in-lab PCR tests&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68xY1N"&gt;That only happens, though, if the investment and interest in these systems continue. Sliding back into the status quo of lab-based testing after the COVID-19 pandemic fades, and not taking advantage of the momentum for at-home testing, would leave everyone in the same position they were in a year ago. “We need to continue the investment,” Linnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="528FUi"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic showed how important it is to be able to quickly and accurately diagnose diseases, de la Zerda says. He thinks there will be more focus on rapid molecular testing so that governments are prepared for new viral threats. They could have made a big difference at the start of this pandemic. “If we had access to these tests in high volumes, we probably would be in a very different position right now,” he says. “We certainly would not be at the level of 500,000 deaths in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7yZl5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7p8Kbe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC announces Vive Pro lip tracking module and new VR body trackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Facial Tracker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SVJfCUsOlSIsVfPpPT187vB4L4=/0x125:1920x1405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941990/HTC_VIVE_Facial_Tracker_attached_to_HTC_VIVE_Pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HTC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wDSEtM"&gt;HTC has announced a new set of trackers for its Vive virtual reality headsets, including one that captures facial expressions and mouth movements. The $129.99 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Faccessory%2Ffacial-tracker%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323093%2Fhtc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vive Facial Tracker&lt;/a&gt; attaches to the Vive Pro headset. It uses two cameras and an infrared illuminator to record lip, cheek, and jaw movements and then translates that into virtual facial expressions. HTC says the product is “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKYqfb"&gt;HTC unveiled an experimental VR facial tracker in 2019, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321736/htc-vive-virtual-reality-social-face-lip-tracking"&gt;teased the product&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week on Twitter. A few developers, like the creators of social space Neos VR, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qZGoaNQD8"&gt;have worked with the tool&lt;/a&gt;. Until today, though, HTC hadn’t confirmed a wide commercial release. The Facial Tracker supports 38 distinct facial movements, and users can also pair it with the Vive Pro Eye, a Vive Pro variant with built-in eye tracking. That could effectively translate most of a user’s face onto an avatar or into a motion capture system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oeqiW3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_l4_aoiVAw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SXs4tU"&gt;There’s also a new, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Faccessory%2Ftracker3%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22323093%2Fhtc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-generation version&lt;/a&gt; of HTC’s general purpose VR tracker. The palm-sized tracking pucks are 33 percent smaller and 15 percent lighter than the last generation, and HTC promises a 75 percent increase in battery life. They will also be released “soon” for $129.99. Depending on the exact date, they could end up competing with the upcoming Tundra Tracker — a smaller, &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/tundra-tracker-kickstarter-delay/"&gt;SteamVR-based alternative&lt;/a&gt; that is expected to ship this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2s7qS"&gt;These HTC modules offer precise, accurate tracking for body parts that standard VR headset sensors don’t capture. Several VR social experiences, for instance, already estimate people’s lip motion based on the sound of their voice. But the new facial tracker can directly capture how their faces move, reflecting expressions like smiles and frowns. Similarly, the VR trackers can be fixed to custom controllers or attached with straps to people’s legs or feet — which are often given rudimentary animation or not displayed at all in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHdUCA"&gt;Unfortunately, the facial tracker apparently has limited compatibility. It’s listed as working with the professional-level Vive Pro line, but not the newer, consumer-focused Vive Cosmos. As VR developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OlivierJT_SU/status/1369660944679329795"&gt;Olivier JT notes on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it also doesn’t appear to support Valve’s Index, a high-end headset whose hardware setup overlaps with the Vive Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1t7F0"&gt;Despite this, face tracking could become an increasingly important part of current-generation VR. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s VR division, Oculus, will prioritize capturing eye movement and facial expressions in future hardware as well as releasing more realistic virtual avatars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Text Adventures: how Twine remade gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhIbW2WgIta5mKUiZw7chgsrpj8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68941964/VRG_ILLO_4425_Twine_Main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3gAWj9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the video game&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, released in 2012, players wake up in a prison with few options: a shower, a nutrient dispenser, a garbage chute, and a recreation room with a virtual reality headset. For the first few clicks, all you can do is navigate the prison: getting your nutrient bar, cleaning up, examining a photograph by your bed. Then you put on the headset, and you’re thrown into a world of strange, vivid imagery. You live out a strange snapshot life before being thrown back to the same tiny room. You click through the same motions again and again, each time visiting a different world, as sparklingly strange as the prison is dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUk4HR"&gt;This was Porpentine Charity Heartscape’s &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;: a poem, a game, and many people’s first introduction to an idiosyncratic piece of free software called Twine. It was — and still is — one of the easiest ways to start making games. An open-source program that produces web-based interactive fiction, Twine can create branching stories simply by putting brackets around words. But the tool is also nearly as flexible as the web itself. Since its release in 2009, it’s helped create a new kind of interactive art — strange, small, lyrical, and often way outside the world of commercial gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loiVNE"&gt;Porpentine followed up with other surreal worlds — where raw intimacy and hints of nostalgia collided with violent, nightmarish cavalcades of trash and sex. &lt;em&gt;Cyberqueen&lt;/em&gt; spun out the messy psychosexual undertones of the ’90s &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; series, drowning a stock first-person shooter premise in slime and bodily fluids. &lt;em&gt;Cry$tal Warrior Ke$ha&lt;/em&gt; sparkled like a glitter-strewn Tumblr post and turned the “Tik Tok” singer into an otherworldly avenging feminine entity. &lt;em&gt;Ultra Business Tycoon III&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantbomb.com%2Farticles%2Fporpentine-s-wonderful-world-of-slime%2F1100-4847%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22321816%2Ftwine-games-history-legacy-art" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;absurdist parody&lt;/a&gt; of a ’90s business simulation game, until its fourth wall cracks to reveal a melancholy parallel narrative. Her writing was simultaneously incredibly personal and transcendently detached from reality, and Twine shaped it into something that felt like a space to explore rather than words on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liufAh"&gt;In an industry obsessed with photorealistic graphics, focus-tested gameplay, and ever-evolving open worlds, Twine’s simplicity felt liberating. It imbued games with the DIY spirit of homemade zines, many of them weirder, sharper, and queerer than their mainstream counterparts. According to some of its biggest fans, Twine was nothing short of a revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0A2IK"&gt;The reality was a lot more complicated and less utopian — but it would still help reinvent a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hbNQdE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Mostly, video games are about men shooting men in the face”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="0ylzfl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Twine editor&lt;/strong&gt; looks like an architect’s drafting table crossed with a conspiracy chart. Users start by creating a “passage,” or a simple text field, that can be linked to new passages. When you’re done with the story, you “publish” it as a single web file, which you can load in any ordinary browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0xJsR"&gt;But Twine is much more than a branching choice simulator. It’s an open-ended system for making almost any kind of game with text, with a scripting language that lets authors determine how each word appears on a page. Twine encourages writing with a crude, hand-coded look, but a meticulous control of rhythm. Passages can make readers wait for agonizing seconds until a single word appears, or they can drop a wall of forking hyperlink paths in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pM6ay0"&gt;If it sounds like a blogging platform, that’s because it was — at least at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hSDig"&gt;In the late 2000s, Twine’s creator, Chris Klimas, was a full-time programmer and part-time student at the University of Baltimore, slowly eking out a graduate degree in interactive design. Klimas was inspired by old-school text games like &lt;em&gt;Zork&lt;/em&gt;, but when he started building his own games, he was frustrated by their puzzle-heavy conventions. So he started looking for his own storytelling system and ended up building one on top of TiddlyWiki — a “non-linear blog analogue” designed by programmer Jeremy Ruston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MkrCab"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pxBFOz"&gt;Twine — and Twee, the language Klimas wrote to underpin it — wasn’t, fundamentally, a new idea. Authors in the 1990s had experimented with digital hypertext fiction, creating multi-threaded novels through websites or programs like Apple’s HyperCard. But at the time, Klimas wasn’t familiar with hypertext. His software also had two big advantages: it could be used with very little practice, and to play the resulting games, all you needed was a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZhMiy"&gt;Klimas started using Twine to write short fiction and personal essays. One of his first pieces was about experiencing syncope — a dreamlike, almost hallucinogenic fainting spell brought on by stress. The episode had sent him to the hospital, and he wanted to convey it in a way that readers could explore at their own pace. “That story was me trying to talk through what happened there and what that experience was like,” he says. “Just sort of saying, like — this is this experience that happened to me, and what happened afterwards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeMixz"&gt;Unfortunately, other writers weren’t nearly as compelled. “I was trying really hard at the time to get writers interested in it. I was like, ‘Hey, writers! You know, like, you like writing stories. Maybe you’d like making an &lt;em&gt;interactive&lt;/em&gt; story!’” he says. “There was sort of a small community. But for about a year, I think it didn’t really go anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yldBVm"&gt;After a couple of years, Klimas was nearly ready to write Twine off. It was tough to even gauge the program’s impact since it produced tiny files that people hosted on personal websites or even storage services like Dropbox. “I had kind of moved on,” he says. But slowly, he realized he was getting bug reports from people he’d never met — asking him to fix a tool he wasn’t sure anybody used. And he saw an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/apr/10/anna-anthropy-twine-revolution"&gt;article in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a proclamation: the Twine revolution had arrived. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="uiF54J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Klimas had designed&lt;/strong&gt; Twine from within the small world of interactive fiction. His community revered classic text-based adventure games, and they often scorned newer and visually splashier successors. “It was like, text adventures are a cut above ‘video games.’ These are &lt;em&gt;serious things&lt;/em&gt;,” he describes it now. “We were a little bit self-serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npryhZ"&gt;What he’d discovered was weirder — and quite a bit lewder — than he’d expected. &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; had interviewed game developer Anna Anthropy, known for the BDSM-themed platformer &lt;em&gt;Mighty Jill Off,&lt;/em&gt; as well as the short and personal &lt;em&gt;Dys4ia&lt;/em&gt;, about her experience with gender dysphoria. Anthropy was also the author of a book called &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Videogame Zinesters&lt;/em&gt;, which urged people to express themselves with simple do-it-yourself games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEjkgV"&gt;Many now-legendary games were built by one or two core developers. And tools like HyperCard and Adobe Flash — as well as &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and other moddable games — turned millions of ordinary people into amateur game designers. But when &lt;em&gt;Zinesters&lt;/em&gt; was published in 2012, the term “video game” evoked glossy action franchises like &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt;. “Mostly, video games are about men shooting men in the face,” Anthropy wrote. “I have to strain to find any game that’s about a queer woman, to find any game that resembles my own experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kp5ktD"&gt;Like Klimas himself, Anthropy started using Twine as an alternative to complicated text adventure tools. “I was trying to find something I could use to make choice-based stories,” she recalls. “Twine was the least bad.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cEAUH"&gt;Her first story adapted a world from &lt;em&gt;ZZT&lt;/em&gt; — an &lt;a href="https://museumofzzt.com/article/445/town-of-zzt-map"&gt;iconic 1991 shareware game&lt;/a&gt; from Tim Sweeney, now the CEO of Epic Games, the studio behind &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Soon, she was giving Twine workshops and promoting it as one of the most affordable, approachable ways to make games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guZDIH"&gt;Mainstream gaming had become sclerotic and timid, Anthropy contended. Studios relied on hundred-person teams with multimillion-dollar budgets, reworking old ideas that they knew would sell. “Mainstream games are really depersonalized. They don’t really tell us a lot about the human condition,” Anthropy told &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; writer Cara Ellison. “What I want to see more of in games is the personal — games that speak to me as a human being, that are relatable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjowcw"&gt;Anthropy wasn’t the only person saying this. The year she published &lt;em&gt;Zinesters&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/308928/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; feted Jonathan Blow&lt;/a&gt; — developer of the hit indie game &lt;em&gt;Braid&lt;/em&gt; — as a disgruntled “maverick” who might finally “establish the video game as an art form.” But Blow was still a professional programmer who spent $200,000 painstakingly crafting &lt;em&gt;Braid&lt;/em&gt;. Anthropy was interested in people with far less money and little formal training, using off-the-shelf tools like GameMaker and Twine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mo0zzD"&gt;At first, Klimas didn’t know what to make of this new community. “I kind of came into it sideways,” he says. “It sort of percolated through to me — like, this is people really doing interesting things with Twine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIKuJB"&gt;In the years after Twine’s launch, it had expanded beyond those original TiddlyWiki snippets. Twine stories were ultimately web pages, and designers started adding images, sound, and JavaScript or CSS snippets that produced new special effects. Some shared their work online — like Leon Arnott, one of the key architects of Twine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlYm1V"&gt;Arnott’s code snippets played with how words appeared on a page. “Most of the features my code provided were to add dynamic changes to text within a single passage,” he says. A &lt;a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/5020"&gt;cycling hyperlink&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, would simply change from one word to another as you clicked it. A &lt;a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/5029"&gt;timed remove&lt;/a&gt; could erase words if a player spent too long reading a passage. Some ideas were Arnott’s own invention, and some were features other writers had come up with but had struggled to create with Twine’s core feature set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQ8YCc"&gt;As Klimas kept building Twine’s open-source editor, he gave Arnott free rein of its default scripting language, Harlowe, cementing the idea that Twine was about playing with words and timing, not just choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8A81k"&gt;A Choose Your Own Adventure book might spell out readers’ options, but they can read the book at any pace in any order. Twine games — even ones mostly based around branching narratives — can compromise that sense of control. In Anthropy’s &lt;a href="https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Queers in Love at the End of the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, your unnamed protagonist is facing the apocalypse. You pick an option for one last moment with your lover: kiss her, hold her, tell her you love her. How do you kiss her? Hungrily? Softly? Fiercely? What do you tell her afterwards? You keep clicking, scanning the text for more options. But at the end of a 10-second timer, each game ends with the same text: &lt;em&gt;Everything is wiped away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="COdJjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It represented everything the stereotypical gamer despised&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="b4rOwj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Twine revolution” &lt;/strong&gt;wasn’t simply about non-programmers making games. Twine offered a home for people who felt alienated from the larger industry, particularly historically marginalized designers. “Twine is this amazing queer and woman-orientated game-making community that didn’t even exist a year ago,” Anthropy told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyDAR7"&gt;And if you found an intriguing Twine game, the tools for building your own were just a few clicks away. After interviewing Anthropy, Cara Ellison found herself thinking about the kind of design that Twine encouraged. “The more I thought about the rhythmic nature and the poetic nature of Twine — placing words on the page so that your eyes would fall to the right kind of part of the sentence at the time that you wanted — the more I thought, well, that’s quite sensual and a little bit sexual,” she says. So she began work on &lt;em&gt;Sacrilege&lt;/em&gt;, a melancholy story about romantic encounters at a nightclub. The short game struck such a chord that, when a bug cropped up years after its publication, a devoted fan discovered and repaired it. That fan has maintained the game ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deAW6x"&gt;Twine’s rise overlapped with a bigger shift toward games that told stories about real-world experiences or social marginalization. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/01/07/255247261/in-gaming-a-shift-from-enemies-to-emotions"&gt;An NPR article&lt;/a&gt; dubbed the genre “empathy games”: nonviolent, often mundane projects that tried to convey human struggles through rules and virtual spaces. Many of these projects were tiny, but some became breakout hits — like the exploration game &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;, which sold 50,000 copies in its first month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaDgXr"&gt;Some Twine projects earned praise from the broader industry. In 2013, &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt; made a surprise appearance at the Independent Games Festival, where grand prize winner Richard Hofmeier spraypainted its name over the booth for his own game &lt;em&gt;Cart Life&lt;/em&gt;, telling them to play &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs &lt;/em&gt;instead. Hofmeier described its effect as a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/magazine/twine-the-video-game-technology-for-all.html"&gt;holy dread&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8uUaqh"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YVKuek"&gt;But Twine writers were more likely to ridicule the gaming world’s excesses than seek its approval. Author Michael Lutz created a comically literal&lt;em&gt; Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; adaptation called &lt;em&gt;Tower of the Blood Lord&lt;/em&gt;, complete with a fake text-based online multiplayer and buttons for crouching and jumping. He said he’d only played 20 minutes of the real game, though — so the multiplayer mode is a food stand simulator, the “campaign” lets you swallow your commanding officer whole instead of selecting a weapon, and the story involves talking animals and questions about personal identity and the nature of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn0caP"&gt;Conversely, &lt;em&gt;The Writer Will Do Something&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/play-the-game-that-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-make-a-good-game/"&gt;an unsparingly unromantic farce&lt;/a&gt; about big-budget game-making. Players join the production team of troubled franchise &lt;em&gt;ShatterGate&lt;/em&gt;, where they navigate byzantine internal politics, impossible player expectations, and a dictionary’s worth of pretentious buzzwords. The game was created by Matthew S. Burns and Tom Bissell — who based it on real experience working on &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty, Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Gears of War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WcTe8"&gt;Even when they weren’t explicitly poking fun at traditional video games, Twine authors toyed with players’ mechanical expectations. Tom McHenry’s &lt;em&gt;Horse Master&lt;/em&gt; is nominally about buying, rearing, and training a horse for a competition. But your horse’s carefully managed stats — “uncanny,” “realness,” “pep,” and other strange descriptors — aren’t actually what’s being measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qtf2lC"&gt;For that matter, a “horse” probably isn’t what you think it is. Because Twine games also often exploit writing’s power to casually suggest unsettling mental images or intriguingly confusing commands — something that graphical video games simply can’t do. In another game, your central power is the option to “&lt;a href="https://debacle.us/ratchaos/"&gt;unleash rat chaos&lt;/a&gt;.” What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; rat chaos, exactly? Players can only guess.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="iSCWkL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sublime fever&lt;/strong&gt; dream of &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt; helped put Twine on the games industry’s radar. But it attracted mainstream attention through a very different project called &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcF8Zl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt; is a deliberately unexciting “choose your own adventure” story. You’re a normal 20-something person trying to get by at work, get along with your girlfriend, and work on a passion project in your free time. Unfortunately, you’re also deeply depressed, so your brain won’t let you do this. Each day gives you a healthy path forward: order some food in the evening, go hang out with a friend, talk to people at a party. These options are crossed out, leaving behind choices like procrastination, long nights alone, and awkward silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPdm6Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt; — created by Zoe Quinn, Patrick Lindsey, and Isaac Schankler — earned positive mentions in &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mostly-indescribable-depression-quest"&gt;outlets like &lt;em&gt;Rock Paper Shotgun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an official exhibition slot at the Indiecade festival. Like a lot of so-called “empathy games,” it used rules to convey the feeling of being limited and powerless, rather than omnipotent and unstoppable. (Eventually, your life &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; take a turn for the better, but only with some concerted work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSxnG2"&gt;But in 2014, a year after &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest’s&lt;/em&gt; release, Quinn’s ex-partner published a rambling diatribe and urged a mob of internet trolls to harass them. The accusations included an unfounded claim that Quinn had an affair with a journalist to promote &lt;em&gt;Depression Quest&lt;/em&gt;. And the movement — soon dubbed Gamergate — tarred Twine itself as the tool of an “anti-gamer” cabal. It represented everything the stereotypical gamer despised: terrible graphics, unapologetically rough edges, and experiences that poked fun at macho fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPJMk6"&gt;Klimas remembers being integrated into the edges of Gamergate’s sprawling conspiracy theory — which included many journalism outlets; the creators of nonviolent and LGBT-themed games like &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt;; and somewhat paradoxically, the Pentagon’s experimental research wing DARPA. He wrote to friends in academia, warning them that Gamergaters had dug up their names as well. But mostly, he was bemused by people who complained that “any idiot” could make a Twine game. “I’m like, congratulations, you understand now!” he says. “Any idiot can pick up a pencil as well. The prejudice related to computational complexity — like if a tool is complicated to learn, it must be better — I completely disagree with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DggvS"&gt;As Klimas readily admits, his experience was very different from Gamergate’s primary targets. Quinn — as well as others like cultural critic Anita Sarkeesian and developer Brianna Wu — were accused of bizarre moral infractions and driven from their homes by threats. The movement painted critics of sexist or transphobic cliches as greedy criminal insurgents attacking defenseless big-budget studios, rather than tiny communities who put most of their work online for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaX3Up"&gt;Gamergate’s influence resonated across mainstream politics. The movement bolstered the careers of right-wing outrage merchants like Milo Yiannopoulos, who would later help promote the white nationalist “alt-right.” It fueled the growth of anonymous forum 8chan, which became a base of operations for the violent QAnon conspiracy movement. The controversy also forced companies and news outlets to reckon with much broader, older online harassment problems. Ultimately, many Gamergate supporters probably weren’t &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;passionate about niche game design software. But they saw ammunition for an endless, ever-evolving culture war — one that continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tsIghk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It manages to essentially teach you how to write well for video games”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="lZuVry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile,&lt;/strong&gt; the “Twine revolution” was more fragile than it looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ua8mIf"&gt;Within a few years, the term “empathy game” &lt;a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/2019/mar/27/empathy-is-not-enough-part-1/"&gt;turned from a straight-faced description&lt;/a&gt; to a wry, bitter joke. To critics, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2017/04/if-you-walk-in-someone-elses-shoes-then.html"&gt;the phrase implied&lt;/a&gt; queer or non-white game developers were attempting to explain themselves to outsiders, and that playing a 10-minute game was equivalent to living under oppression. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mgbwpv/empathy-games-dont-exist"&gt;Anthropy balked&lt;/a&gt; when people described &lt;em&gt;Dys4ia&lt;/em&gt; as a way to safely understand being a trans woman. In 2015, she produced an art installation called &lt;em&gt;Empathy Game&lt;/em&gt; that was simply a pair of her old shoes and a pedometer — making fun of the idea that players were literally “walking a mile in her shoes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxcD3"&gt;A game could lay out someone’s personal experience, or it could help explain social systems that were often invisible. But simply &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; about that system wouldn’t necessarily spur people to change it. Awareness, it turned out, wasn’t a substitute for action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGrZ9U"&gt;Expressing vulnerability online felt increasingly fraught. Developer Merritt K, who had created games about BDSM and sex, took much of her old work offline after Gamergate. “A lot of it felt personal in a way that I was uncomfortable with,” she &lt;a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/merritt-k-on-changing-your-path/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Creative Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Not that those kinds of things didn’t happen before, but being personal online was a much more dangerous proposition after that for a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL3PUM"&gt;Twine itself wasn’t quite as simple and universal as mainstream coverage of it suggested. The tool’s interface and scripting languages were designed for writers who spoke English and understood the conventions of branching storytelling. Learning its more complex features requires sifting through a now-dormant Twine wiki, a still-active Twine “cookbook,” and myriad help threads across multiple forums. Publishing a story requires a basic understanding of web hosting or storefronts like Itch.io. It’s easier than many professional design tools but doesn’t have the radical simplicity of a stapled-together zine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SKNtO7"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hk2Znd"&gt;This tension had existed for years. Back in 2014, Dan Cox — who authored some of the most comprehensive Twine guides — &lt;a href="http://www.electrondance.com/faltering-faith-in-twines-teaching/"&gt;denounced what he dubbed&lt;/a&gt; the “lie” that Twine didn’t require programming. “Twine has never been free of code and never will be,” Cox wrote. Today, a wide array of Twine script re-creates or integrates other languages like JavaScript or CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCmrL5"&gt;Unfortunately, Twine &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t work well for big and highly complex projects. Passages start to freeze up if you type too much text in them, and if you’re developing a game with another person, it’s easy to accidentally overwrite their work. Klimas maintains the Twine editor alongside a full-time job, funded by a Patreon campaign that earns up to roughly $1,400 a month. It works remarkably well for such a small project, but it’s not as full-featured as commercial software or a massive open-source collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NiCsHl"&gt;Some Twine supporters have drifted away from the medium. Porpentine had begun working outside Twine soon after &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, and in 2017, she distanced herself from other queer developers who had fostered Twine, &lt;a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/hot-allostatic-load/"&gt;publishing an essay&lt;/a&gt; that accused unnamed community members of abuse. When I contacted her, she described the essay as her farewell to any coherent Twine community. “Twine is pretty old now, and kind of died as a communal thing,” she wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR0TFz"&gt;Over time, the online landscape for Twine has changed. Many older games were posted on Philomela — a simple hosting platform created by programmer Colin Marc. “At that time, a lot of Twine games were hosted on Dropbox, which obviously sucked,” Marc says. “The site was a way for me to be involved and helpful.” (He also attributes it to a “pretty embarrassing desire to be friends with all the cool game dev people I followed on Twitter.”) But over the years, Marc drifted away from Twine, and the internet in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwJtbD"&gt;“My honest appraisal of Twine is that although it is really useful if you have no technical expertise, it is actually quite constricting,” he says now. “There have been really clever, interesting things done with Twine, but they were done by people working around the limitations of the tool.” Marc realized that Twine might never have a breakout moment, the way &lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; had sold mainstream audiences on exploration games. In 2019, he set off on a year-long travel expedition with limited internet service, and he decided to pull the plug on Philomela — moving its existing games to Google Cloud Storage and retiring one of Twine’s original hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3h1o0t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than&lt;/strong&gt; a decade after its creation, Klimas’s work remains a significant force in gaming and interactive fiction. Browse &lt;a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-twine"&gt;the Twine tag&lt;/a&gt; on the Itch.io storefront, and you’ll find a steady stream of new titles — even if the “popular” tab includes a lot of games created years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAqMT2"&gt;Many designers use Twine or Twee to prototype branching narratives they’ll adapt for other platforms, including &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; creator Charlie Brooker, who worked with Twine for the interactive special &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;. University instructors use Twine to help students learn game design basics before they start working with general-purpose tools. Even without a unified community, Twine still serves its original purpose: to give people an easy framework for imagining nonlinear stories, whatever form those stories ultimately take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0voPoL"&gt;Twine has helped inspire other software. The platform influenced Yarn Spinner, for instance — the branching dialogue tool used in award-winning indie adventure game &lt;em&gt;Night in the Woods. &lt;/em&gt;“Ironically, I think a lot of Twine’s influence since 2013 has been in the form of tools derived from it,” says Arnott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4K4KNn"&gt;It’s also still evolving. Klimas is currently developing a Harlowe alternative called Chapbook, and while Twine remains open-source, he helped design a proprietary tool for porting stories to iOS — and released his first game with it, &lt;em&gt;Night in the Unpleasant Hous‪e&lt;/em&gt;, last year. During the pandemic, Arnott decided to overhaul Harlowe with new features and fuller customization options, releasing what he calls the first “full” version of the tool in January. “I feel like Harlowe is currently in a state of stability it’s never had before — my long-standing desperation to improve it has abated,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDdiMk"&gt;While many people use Twine without any kind of support, there’s an active Twine community on Discord and Reddit. It offers help with design problems and organizes Twine-focused game jams, most recently a “Valentwines Day Poetry Jam” in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpZv92"&gt;Some Twine designers have made the leap to professional game development, fine art, or other fields. Porpentine has released numerous games alongside zines, short stories, and a Sundance Film Festival installation; in 2017, her games were exhibited at the Whitney Biennial. Ellison’s &lt;em&gt;Sacrilege&lt;/em&gt; led to work on the big-budget stealth game &lt;em&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/em&gt;, as well as acclaimed lo-fi shooter &lt;em&gt;Void Bastards&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s a really good educational tool for figuring out whether you like working in games or not,” she says of Twine. “It manages to essentially teach you how to write well for video games, because it requires you to be concise and plan out how you’re going to make a conversation go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvQkfV"&gt;And the minimalist, white-on-black “Twine story” format instantly evokes text adventures and the early web. It’s easy to convey big, abstract concepts with a gloss of absurdity — like Kris Ligman’s &lt;em&gt;You Are Jeff Bezos&lt;/em&gt;, where your job is simply to spend &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9k77vd/you-are-jeff-bezos-twine-game"&gt;Jeff Bezos’s money better than he does&lt;/a&gt;. Like a pixelated &lt;em&gt;Mario Bros.-&lt;/em&gt;style platformer or the camera of a first-person shooter, it offers a recognizable template for translating almost any idea into a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cMacSl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If those services shut down, players’ work could be lost forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p id="hGr9qd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I put my first&lt;/strong&gt; Twine story online in 2018. I chose the platform because I had an idea for a silly pastiche of a first-person shooter series, I wanted to make it quickly, and I was an experienced writer but had no meaningful background in programming or art design. Then I got hooked on learning its scripting system and web design possibilities. A few months later, I convinced &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to publish &lt;a href="https://adirobertson.itch.io/wake-word"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wake Word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a short game about a “helpful” AI-controlled apartment that keeps accidentally killing you. Its structure was shaped by the surreal, cyclical prison experience of &lt;em&gt;Howling Dogs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BEI7H"&gt;I’ve released a handful of other short games since then, all of them built in Twine. And sometimes learning its scripts first instead of “real” coding feels like it was a mistake. I usually don’t make the branching narratives &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;experiential poetry Twine is best for, so I’ve spent a lot of time accidentally working against its constraints — like the time I wrote the start of a narrative game with a single fight scene, only to end up building a real-time word-themed combat system by forcing Twine to reload randomly selected links using dozens of overlapping timers. Still, coming incredibly late to the Twine party, I’ve benefited from years of forum members answering each other’s remarkably complex scripting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpr7HB"&gt;As a woman who started writing about video games a decade ago, I’ve benefited in less tangible ways as well. Twine’s popularity helped raise the profile of several now well-known female gamemakers. There are still huge problems with misogyny in the medium, but in 2021, I feel a lot less pressure to represent &lt;em&gt;women in games&lt;/em&gt; — and more space to do what I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, which is apparently making jokes about smart homes and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726477/cyberpunkland-dystopia-online-game"&gt;cyberpunk tropes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0kzzH"&gt;And sometimes Twine’s reputation as simply a beginner’s game-making system feels like a disservice. Because for all its limitations, Twine is one of the only tools custom-built for speaking the language of the web. The past several years have seen the rise of video games that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15027520/video-games-smartphone-mobile-text-messages"&gt;mimic digital spaces&lt;/a&gt;, like the instant-messaging simulation &lt;em&gt;Emily Is Away&lt;/em&gt; or the faux website &lt;a href="http://www.mackerelmediafish.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mackerelmedia Fish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At its heart, Twine is an easy way to write stories that take place in web browsers, and the more our lives play out online, the more powerful that can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pCE7A"&gt;One of the Twine jam organizers, who goes by Lee, says he grew up reading Choose Your Own Adventure books. But, “I got bored with the traditional [interactive fiction] format pretty quickly,” he says. He wanted to make something that didn’t feel like a branching novel, but also didn’t require extensive coding or art experience. So he began making horror games inspired by phone apps, websites, and creepypasta — the short, scary stories that circulate on internet message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uEXO2Z"&gt;&lt;div class="ad"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36ztlO"&gt;Lee’s first published game, from 2019, is &lt;em&gt;Please Answer Carefully&lt;/em&gt;, which is supposedly a web survey about your screen time habits. After a few pages, though, the survey’s questions start getting strangely needy. Then, the possible answers start getting a lot more sinister. The experience is short and simple, without even the branches or multiple endings many people expect of interactive fiction. But it’s also very effective, slowly twisting what’s supposedly a blank mirror for the player’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5Cr8i"&gt;These kinds of pseudo-software games can comment directly on the larger conditions of the internet. Mark Sample’s &lt;em&gt;Content Moderator Sim&lt;/em&gt; gives you an 8-hour (actually, 5-minute) shift at “ViralTitans,” a fictitious content moderation contractor. Under a relentless timer and some passive-aggressive messages from a supervisor, it dryly describes social media posts that range from distasteful to terrifying, asking you to make a call on each one. It hints at the stress and frustration of being a moderator, but it’s not just a plea for empathy — it’s a test of which horrors &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; will personally let slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6lZpY"&gt;In 2021, Twine’s web-based design has proven surprisingly resilient. “I believe really strongly in the web,” says Klimas. “Things have been moving in the wrong direction for quite a while in terms of the web as a medium for consumption, not creation. But I think the battle isn’t completely over yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTvsgk"&gt;Twine is far from the only free and approachable game-making program, but its openness is still unusual. “There are more tools, but many of those tools are tightly gatekept by platform owners,” Anthropy notes. “Tools like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; make game-making way more achievable for non-professionals, but everything you create is owned by Nintendo or Sony.” If those services shut down, players’ work could be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyIauT"&gt;Many Twine stories &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; disappear at some point, lost to changing browser standards or lapsed web domains. But whether their work is ephemeral or stays online for decades, Twine lets people make art on their own terms — even if, eventually, everything is wiped away.&lt;/p&gt;
