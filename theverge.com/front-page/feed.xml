    <title>Amazon’s Wheel of Time show is finally revealed in its first trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dyq42-BO0BXG5FA_xaF7JTtN0Rw=/90x0:1110x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808882/woft_s1_ut_106_200210_thijan_00699r_v2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jan Thijs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I7rGRr"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fus4Xb_TLg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, giving an early look at Amazon’s upcoming adaptation of Robert Jordan’s epic 14-book fantasy series ahead of its November 19th release date on Amazon Prime Video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGkz8K"&gt;The trailer sets the stage for the series, establishing some of the basic tenets of Jordan’s world, with a specific focus on Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike), a member of a group of female magic wielders known as the Aes Sedai, who are capable of wielding the One Power to accomplish feats like controlling the elements and healing others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvx1ir"&gt;The trailer also shows off a first look at &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt;’s younger cast: Madeleine Madden as Egwene al’Vere, Marcus Rutherford as Perrin Aybara, Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon, Zoë Robins as Nynaeve al’Meara, and Josha Stradowski as Rand al’Thor — the five central characters in Jordan’s books who Moiraine ends up mentoring as they journey to save the world from darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFEyAj"&gt;Fans will also recognize other key elements of Jordan’s story teased in the trailer, including a visit to Shadar Logoth, a cursed city of shadow; the White Tower of Tar Valon and a glimpse at the different color-coded orders of Aes Sedai; and the show’s take on the corrupted Myrddraal and Trollocs that will oppose Moiraine’s group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AN5ptB"&gt;It’s been a long road for &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; series to become a TV show. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928400/amazon-video-robert-jordan-wheel-of-time-neil-gaiman"&gt;Amazon first announced&lt;/a&gt; that it had greenlit a series in 2018, but production was delayed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9YS61"&gt;Amazon’s show isn’t technically the first time an attempt at a &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; show has been put to the screen: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8008387/wheel-of-time-pilot-fxx"&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, FXX aired a half-hour episode of &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time: Winter Dragon, &lt;/em&gt;a pilot that had been secretly produced and aired in the dead of night as an attempt to prevent the adaptation rights for the series from reverting back to Jordan’s estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GkWxYE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A Wheel of Time pilot was produced and aired when no one was looking","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8008387/wheel-of-time-pilot-fxx"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WugcFs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; is just one part of Amazon’s plans for a big-budget fantasy adaptation to try to succeed as the heir to &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones. &lt;/em&gt;The company is also hard at work on a new &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; series that looks to be one of the most expensive TV shows ever made, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606267/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-release-date"&gt;which will debut on September 2nd, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter has plans to let users hide their old tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aUSgHb96s9TjFkEel0WK2pjckKY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808819/akrales_180620_1777_0266.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjbShG"&gt;Twitter is planning new features to give people more privacy options, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/twitter-plans-new-privacy-features-to-get-more-people-tweeting"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The social network’s plans reportedly include the option to archive old tweets so they’re not visible to other users after a given period of time (like 30, 60, or 90 days or a full year). They also include possible options to limit who can see which tweets you’ve liked, to let people remove themselves from a conversation on Twitter, and to let people remove followers without outright blocking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RSkbr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;describes the new features as a suite of “social privacy” changes that are aimed at making people more comfortable engaging on Twitter. Internal research at Twitter apparently found that many users don’t even understand whether their accounts are set to public or private — something the company will begin asking users to review in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9e43Je"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes would replace workarounds like soft blocking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i66TYG"&gt;There’s no timeline for some of the changes, and the archive option, in particular, is in the “concept phase,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. But Twitter reportedly plans to start letting people remove themselves from conversations by the end of the year and to let people remove followers (as opposed to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-soft-block-on-twitter#:~:text=To%20soft%20block%20someone%2C%20you,t%20appear%20to%20be%20blocked."&gt;soft blocking&lt;/a&gt; them) starting this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yisL7a"&gt;Twitter confirmed the news in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “At Twitter, privacy is more than what we do with your data, it’s also about how we help you feel safe and in control of how you show up on Twitter,” a spokesperson said. “We understand that there’s no one size fits all approach to privacy, so we’re excited to roll out more features and tools to empower people on Twitter to customize their experience. Our focus on social privacy is inspired by feedback we received through a global research study we conducted to better understand people’s perceptions of and needs for privacy around the globe. We’ll begin testing some of these features as soon as next week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOQ256"&gt;The upcoming changes accompany a flurry of other recent updates to Twitter. Over the past year, the company has tested monetization features like ticketed audio rooms, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; last week, and subscription-based “Super Follows,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651138/twitter-super-follow-launch-subscription-ios"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4FRmr"&gt;As&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; acknowledges, the privacy changes replicate sometimes clunky workarounds that many users have already adopted, including external services that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete tweets&lt;/a&gt; after a certain period of time. That stands in contrast with Twitter’s Fleets — an expiring message tool that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;Twitter retired after eight months&lt;/a&gt; of low usage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Totally real actor who plays Roy Kent responds to conspiracy theory that he is CGI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D12nxpfJHk6eq5e9crJU7HCjJIQ=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69803841/brett_goldstein_ted_lasso.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You want me to believe this is flesh and blood? Absolutely not, but they did a great job with the fabric effects. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPszDs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 2nd, 12:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “actor” Brett Goldstein has addressed the conspiracy theory that &lt;/em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;em&gt;’s Roy Kent is a CGI creation head-on by publishing a statement on Instagram. In it, Goldstein notes (quite accurately) that “there’s a fucking load of mad shit happening on the internet today, as usual” before reassuring viewers that he is “a completely real normal human man” who does “normal human basic things like rendering and buffering and transferring data.” Glad to have that sorted out. (The original story follows below.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTUy0KgjhJI/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by Brett Goldstein (@mrbrettgoldstein)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mpDj55"&gt;I’ll confess this upfront: I’ve yet to watch an episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso. &lt;/em&gt;But I absolutely buy the conspiracy theory that one of the show’s main characters, Roy Kent, is a CGI creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyzetq"&gt;People on Reddit have apparently been talking about this &lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TedLasso/comments/j268hn/ok_just_started_the_show_and_cgi/"&gt;for months&lt;/a&gt;, but after their discussion was shared on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guymrdth/status/1431693140902219781"&gt;Twitter this week&lt;/a&gt;, the theory about the Apple TV Plus show has gone mainstream. I read some of the threads, googled some screenshots of Kent himself (or &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;), and I have to agree: the man looks like he stepped straight out of &lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A7yoFl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;no more ted lasso discourse it's time for "brett goldstein is cgi" discourse &lt;a href="https://t.co/DkSlFAlNp7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DkSlFAlNp7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— guy (@guymrdth) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guymrdth/status/1431693140902219781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QCD3J"&gt;When I broached the subject in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack, a number of colleagues said they’d already had this exact discussion with friends. “I have thought this since ep 1 and i did not know it was a thing other people thought!” said one, before sharing screencaps of a group chat on the subject, which devolved into a discussion about how &lt;em&gt;furry&lt;/em&gt; Kent is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42U7Z5"&gt;None of us could put our fingers on exactly why Roy (who is “played” by “actor” Brett Goldstein) looks so uncanny, but we settled on the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="AnOTWw"&gt;The man has perfect facial hair. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zx4hoo"&gt;Apple loves using soft lighting that makes fabric and skin look oddly smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mtEPBk"&gt;The contextual triggers of him being a footballer make one think of &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hyX4Tc"&gt;Is his head maybe quite big in comparison to the rest of his body? Is that rude???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8h3jKG"&gt;And in fairness, TV shows and films are blurring the line between CGI and human actors more than ever nowadays. Think about the appearance of a de-aged Princess Leia in &lt;em&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story &lt;/em&gt;or (SPOILER ALERT) Luke Skywalker at the end of the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. Nvidia even did a recent press conference, which included a CGI version of the company’s CEO, Jensen Huang (though only for a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nvidia-faked-part-of-a-press-conference-with-a-cgi-ceo/"&gt;single, brief shot&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Nfx5"&gt;So, yeah, Roy Kent is CGI, I buy it! Why not? For good measure, I’m going to start believing that my boss, family, and close friends are all CGI as well. Maybe one day I’ll be able to join them. At least if I was computer-generated, my beard would look better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces tiny and huge versions of one of its best TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14ubZMt9VBo3c5RmaV4M4ipB4DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808798/DSCF2777.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ak8wvB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/cedia-2021-samsung-launches-new-products-and-programs-powering-successful-partnerships/"&gt;Samsung has announced&lt;/a&gt; new sizes for some of its best TVs, giving more choices to consumers who want the option of either a small or massive flagship TV. Samsung has added 43-inch and 98-inch sizes to its QN90A lineup of “Neo QLED” 4K TVs and an 85-inch option for its The Frame TV. The Neo QLED TVs have Samsung’s flagship panels, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;use Mini LED backlights&lt;/a&gt; to improve contrast and picture quality. These kinds of flagship-class panels used to be limited mostly to the 55- to 77-inch range, but they seem to be making their way to size classes that used to be reserved for budget TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAcBuI"&gt;Samsung hasn’t yet announced pricing for these TVs. At the moment, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-50-Inch-Class-QN90A-Built/dp/B08YPBJ2T8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch QN90A&lt;/a&gt; sells for $1,400 (with an MSRP of $1,500), and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-85-Inch-Class-QN90A-Built/dp/B08V3B227H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch&lt;/a&gt; model can be had for $4,000, a cool $1,000 less than its list price. It seems unlikely that the 43-inch version would cost more than the 50-inch one or that the 98-inch model would cost less than the 85-incher. Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/the-frame/75-the-frame-qled-4k-smart-tv-2021-qn75ls03aafxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch The Frame&lt;/a&gt; costs $3,000 at MSRP, so you can likely expect the 85-inch option there to cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JUwMzj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smaller TVs with flagship-grade panels seem to be a trend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t70C9U"&gt;Smaller TVs with flagship-grade panels have started to become more common. LG announced that its CX line would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051516/lg-new-oled-4k-8k-tv-gx-cx-bx-ces-2020"&gt;get a 48-inch offering in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and it went even smaller this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224137/lg-display-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-announced"&gt;announcing a 42-inch model&lt;/a&gt; (though its release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640058/lg-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-delayed-ces-2022"&gt;has reportedly been delayed&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228859/asus-gaming-monitor-refresh-rate-hdmi-21-ces-2021-rog-strix-swift-4k"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt; also offer TV-sized gaming monitors, with models available that pack 43- and 48-inch panels. TV-sized monitors (or monitor-sized TVs) are good for those who have either massive desks or smaller houses — or even people who just aren’t that interested in having a TV take up all the space in their living room (and who don’t want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577063/lg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;shell out $100K for LG’s rollable TV&lt;/a&gt; for some odd reason).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyT2FR"&gt;There are, of course, people who want to go in a more maximalist direction. If you found the existing 85-inch QN890A to be pathetically small, then perhaps the new 98-inch size could be a good alternative to Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2xlkKIGNsMw?t=1948"&gt;catastrophically expensive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583204/samsung-the-wall-micro-led-display-business-commercial"&gt;The Wall TV&lt;/a&gt; (not that we know yet how much it’ll cost). There’s also the bigger version of The Frame, which used to max out at 75 inches. While the new Frame isn’t as big as the new Neo QLED, it’s perhaps more aesthetically pleasing, looking like a painting when it’s not displaying content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KNcclE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s nice to see more size options for people who still want a nice TV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X33NEO"&gt;Whether you prefer smaller, bigger, or midsize TVs, it’s nice to see that Samsung’s making more size options available to those who still want a nice TV. A Samsung spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the 43-inch Neo should be available in a few days, with the 98-inch Neo and 85-inch Frame coming in a few weeks. The company wasn’t able to provide firm dates or prices, so we’ll keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus is going all-in on OLED laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user uses the ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED, drawing on the touchpad with a stylus and operating the Asus Dial. The laptop sits on a small circular table with scattered pens to its left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_OdFkojGYAuNHjTnQQd4Rs2wJE=/0x0:1731x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808612/ProArt_Studiobook_16___Pro_16_OLED_H5600_W5600_Unbeatable_combination_of_CPU___GPU_power.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the new ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lUxdpU"&gt;Asus has announced the ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED and the ProArt StudioBook 16 Pro OLED, two of the first 16-inch laptops to include 4K OLED HDR displays. Per Asus, the displays will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and deliver a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio (neither of which is uncommon among 4K OLED panels). The laptops target creative professionals who work in “color-critical” applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXhRJP"&gt;The two devices come with an interesting new peripheral called the Asus Dial, a physical wheel on the left side of the keyboard deck. Users can map this controller to adjust various parameters in Adobe apps, which Asus says include After Effects, Photoshop, Photoshop Lightroom Classic, and Premiere Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saEBG1"&gt;The StudioBook 16 and StudioBook 16 Pro will be available in North America in Q4, starting at $1,999.99 and $2,499.99, respectively. The difference between the two models is largely the chips. The Pro can come with an AMD Ryzen 5000 H-Series mobile processor or an Intel Xeon processor as well as an Nvidia RTX A2000 or A5000 GPU; the regular StudioBook can come with a Ryzen 5000 H-series or Intel Core i7 chip, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 or RTX 3060 GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The VivoBook Pro 14X on a white background, open. The screen displays a multicolor pastel background with the Asus VivoBook OLED on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOVFmB1c24uamy8tcPxiIUVPCk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820800/VivoBook_Pro_14X___16X_OLED_M7600_DialPad.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the VivoBook Pro 14X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zR7k7j"&gt;Asus’ budget-oriented VivoBook line has also been outfitted with OLED screens, and some will have a digital version of the Asus Dial built into the touchpad. The 14-inch, 15-inch, and 16-inch models will start as low as $749.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsRFp1"&gt;A new creator-oriented ZenBook Pro Duo 15 OLED is also coming in Q4 ($2,799.99), featuring Asus’ signature secondary touchscreen on the keyboard deck; a non-Duo version with just a single screen will also be available starting at $1,469.99. The Duo includes Intel processors up to a Core i9 and an RTX 3070 GPU; the standard model has Ryzen 5000 processors and an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OAKDZ"&gt;Even Asus’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;ExpertBook business laptops&lt;/a&gt;, known for being mind-blowingly light, are getting OLED panels. The new ExpertBook B5 OLED and convertible B5 Flip OLED are both powered by 11th Gen Intel processors, with models starting at $1,299.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y9pxn"&gt;Asus made a splash in the ultraportable market last year with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;, delivering a display technology that was once a luxury affair for &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202106AM030000001"&gt;as low as $800&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;Samsung announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to mass-produce laptop-sized OLED panels this year, it was only a matter of time before we started seeing them implemented across smaller and more affordable models on a large scale. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s new Zenbook 14X is the latest thin and light laptop with an OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 14X facing away from the camera, angled to the right, half open, on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBZ2T4WQRXJkPYGrvIy9a290FiE=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808604/Zenbook_14X_OLED_UX5400_Product_photo_Pine_Grey_Thin_and_light.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the Asus Zenbook 14X.&lt;/em&gt; | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VLBXqs"&gt;Asus’s Zenbooks are known for being quite lightweight and quite affordable. But the company is adding another calling card to the line: OLED display technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPGg5A"&gt;The new 14-inch Zenbook 14X OLED will be available with either a 4K OLED HDR display or a 2.8K OLED 90Hz display. Given those resolutions, either should be a significant step up in picture quality from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Zenbook 13 OLED&lt;/a&gt;, the ultraportable OLED model Asus released earlier this year. That device has an FHD OLED display (which was still quite vivid and bright in our testing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUgPpb"&gt;The Zenbook 14X OLED will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut and a 0.2ms response time. Asus claims it will emit “70 percent less harmful blue light than normal LCD”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzGZa9"&gt;Screen aside, the 14X weighs 3.09 pounds and is 0.67 inches thick — decently portable, though there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;thinner and lighter 14-inchers out there&lt;/a&gt;. It can be configured with 11th-Gen Intel processors up to a Core i7, as well as 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage. Port selection includes Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, and a microSD reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiD5Lu"&gt;That all sounds good, but the big question mark is battery life. A high-resolution screen in a thin and light laptop can sometimes be a recipe for disaster there, as we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;time and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;time again&lt;/a&gt;. The Zenbook 13 OLED lasted over 11 hours in our testing, which is excellent, but that screen has many fewer pixels to power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sicLy"&gt;The Zenbook 14X OLED starts at $1,399.99 — a lot more than the Zenbook 13 OLED, which starts at $799. That’s not necessarily surprising, given the 14-incher’s larger and higher-resolution screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook Flip 14 OLED open facing the camera with the number pad illuminated. The screen displays a multicolored flower background with the Asus Zenbook OLED logo on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ssunf59CR7dkOYVw30ZwjLtDUhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821323/Zenbook_14_Flip_OLED_UP5401_Product_photo_4K_OLED_panel.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the convertible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7IgVO4"&gt;There’s a convertible version of the 14X coming as well — the Zenbook 14 Flip OLED. That model has the same resolution options, and its touch display supports a “4096-pressure-level stylus”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8lLwt"&gt;The new release follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;Samsung’s announcement in January&lt;/a&gt; that the company would start mass-producing 14-inch 90Hz OLED panels this year. The new Zenbook may be the first of many 14-inch OLED notebooks to hit shelves in the next few months; Samsung did not release a list of partners at the time of its announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TV streaming service Locast suspends service after court ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Locast NYC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aBSxiVLTUdlgDoaVNz617DmIfM=/0x21:1231x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808484/Locast_nyc.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="02u16J"&gt;Locast has announced that it is suspending its TV streaming service starting today, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652988/broadcaster-victory-locast-abc-nbc-fox-cbs"&gt;court ruling earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; in a lawsuit from ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748677/locast-streaming-tv-lawsuit-abc-cbs-fox-nbc"&gt;jointly sued the nonprofit service&lt;/a&gt; shortly after it launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jTl5Mn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Broadcasters secure a win in their fight against scrappy TV streamer Locast","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652988/broadcaster-victory-locast-abc-nbc-fox-cbs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zxXUE0"&gt;“As a non-profit, Locast was designed from the very beginning to operate in accordance with the strict letter of the law, but in response to the court’s recent rulings, with which we respectfully disagree, we are hereby suspending operations, effective immediately,” an email to Locast users sent out this morning reads. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_XJy8yI3FE-inmk-6XHBeCGR9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822622/IMG_3197.PNG"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XDrvb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236704/locast-review-streaming-free-local-programming-tv"&gt;Locast was launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; as an internet-based alternative to over-the-air television, rebroadcasting local, free over-the-air signals over the internet to users in those areas. Unlike Aereo, a similar service that was shut down after a lawsuit ruled it was violating copyright by rebroadcasting over-the-air networks online, Locast relied on a loophole, using its status as a nonprofit to retransmit broadcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euN6qJ"&gt;Locast didn’t technically charge a fee, although it frequently interrupted its free streams to request that users sign up for recurring $5 donations to keep the service running. But ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC sued anyway, and it seems that the court has sided with the broadcasters, ruling earlier this week that Locast’s requests for donations exceeded “the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the service” and that it therefore didn’t meet the exception provided by copyright law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kyx3aS"&gt;Locast first responded by announcing on Wednesday evening it would simply remove the donation requests. “This means that anyone located in a market we serve who signs up for Locast will get the service without interruption, regardless of whether or not they donate,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="618lID"&gt;Today’s email, however, seems to have reversed that plan, with the service shutting down entirely. Locast has yet to announce what its plans for the future are or if the service will be returning in some form at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moonfall is a disaster movie about the Moon falling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0RiIe3Z-VBoZVDCe1ENE8QcA7w=/214x0:886x448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808346/Screen_Shot_2021_09_02_at_10.58.58_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OYykqu"&gt;You pretty much always know what to expect from a Roland Emmerich movie: namely, that a good chunk of the planet is going to be destroyed. The director of films like &lt;em&gt;2012&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Day After Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; is now taking that to its logical extreme with &lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt;, a movie about the Moon... falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAgWCi"&gt;According to the synopsis, the movie is set when “a mysterious force knocks the Moon from its orbit around Earth and sends it hurtling on a collision course with life as we know it.” It stars Halle Berry as a NASA exec who seems to know how to stop it, but the only people who believe her are a former astronaut (Patrick Wilson) and a conspiracy theorist (John Bradley). “These unlikely heroes will mount an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love, only to find out that our Moon is not what we think it is,” the description reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNOMxS"&gt;Really, &lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt; sounds like what would happen if you mashed a Hollywood disaster movie with &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; lore — which is to say, it sounds like a lot of fun. It’s expected to come to theaters on February 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC bans spyware app SpyFone, orders it to delete illegally harvested data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xeRhYSV6GvSCjh_KN_vbeCpTCs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808228/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The FTC has voted to ban SpyFone | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y46sHr"&gt;On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-bans-spyfone-and-ceo-from-surveillance-business"&gt;announced it had banned&lt;/a&gt; spyware maker SpyFone and its CEO Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance business. The commission called SpyFone a “stalkerware app company” that allegedly harvested and shared data about people’s movements, phone use, and online activity via a hidden device hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWB70J"&gt;“The company’s apps sold real-time access to their secret surveillance, allowing stalkers and domestic abusers to stealthily track the potential targets of their violence,” the FTC said in a statement. “SpyFone’s lack of basic security also exposed device owners to hackers, identity thieves, and other cyber threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxsbVg"&gt;In addition to the ban, the FTC ordered SpyFone to delete illegally harvested data and notify device owners when the app had been installed without their knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qiiTm"&gt;“We must be clear eyed about the variety of threats that surveillance businesses pose,” FTC chair Lina Khan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/linakhanFTC/status/1433435163707547649?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. “The FTC will be vigilant in its data security and privacy enforcement and will seek to vigorously protect the public from these dangers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5GMRm"&gt;Stalkwerware apps, which are banned by app stores, can be used to track a user’s movements and online activities without their knowledge, sometimes marketed as ways to for “catching a cheating spouse” or, more subtly, to keep tabs on employees or children, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/coalition-against-stalkerware-expands-membership#breadcrumb:~:text=Stalkerware%20is%20the%20class%20of%20apps,that%20they%20are%20not%20being%20monitored."&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (EFF). Such apps can be used to perpetuate harassment and abuse, according to the &lt;a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/"&gt;Coalition Against Stalkerware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL1Lcr"&gt;SpyFone ran at a phone’s root level for several of its functions, the FTC said, including monitoring email and video chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Incoq8"&gt;The app and its CEO are banned from “offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,” according to the FTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzVren"&gt;The EFF praised the FTC’s order. “With the FTC now turning its focus to this industry, victims of stalkerware can begin to find solace in the fact that regulators are beginning to take their concerns seriously,” the foundation’s leadership wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/victory-federal-trade-commission-bans-stalkerware-company-conducting-business"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqUnYT"&gt;The FTC board voted 5-0 to accept the consent order with the company. SpyFone, which is now doing business as Support King, did not admit or deny the FTC’s allegations, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/192_3003_spyfone_agreement_and_order_without_signatures_0.pdf"&gt;consent order agreement &lt;/a&gt;(pdf). Commissioner Rohit Chopra issued a separate &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2021/09/statement-commissioner-rohit-chopra-matter-spyfone"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, saying the proposed order “in no way releases or absolves” the company or the CEO from potential criminal liability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rn6E2f"&gt;“While this action was worthwhile, I am concerned that the FTC will be unable to meaningfully crack down on the underworld of stalking apps using our civil enforcement authorities,” Chopra wrote. “I hope that federal and state enforcers examine the applicability of criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Wiretap Act, and other criminal laws, to combat illegal surveillance, including the use of stalkerware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DswrE4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARzIHm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Red Notice’s first trailer is full of explosions, car chases, art heists, and Ryan Reynolds quips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kcRfqafcnQjZC_GkJr4IMR7LEc=/326x51:1294x696/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69808080/RN_FirstLook_V220210707_4521_1pex5jr.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Frank Masi/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ToBATd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6l3mM7AWew"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Netflix’s next big action movie swing, has gotten its first trailer, showing off the fast (and dare I say, &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt;) antics of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. He plays the FBI’s top profiler as he hunts down the world’s two most wanted criminals — played by Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XBIRa"&gt;Based on the trailer, it seems Johnson’s Agent John Hartley actually catches Reynolds’ character, Nolan Booth — dubbed “the world’s greatest art thief” — fairly early on, forcing the two to partner up in order to catch Gadot’s character, “The Bishop.” She’s described as “the world’s most wanted art thief,” which is apparently a different thing than being the world’s greatest art thief. This is also, broadly, the plot of &lt;em&gt;Hobbs &amp;amp; Shaw,&lt;/em&gt; a movie that Johnson and Reynolds both were actually in. Gadot is also a &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; franchise alum, which seems fitting. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvOaiJO8s1lmT_t7P8Jt447yvbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822434/unnamed.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="j8OsEo"&gt;The film is named after &lt;a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices"&gt;Interpol’s actually real Red Notices&lt;/a&gt;, which are slightly less interesting international wanted notices that — in what I assume are almost all cases — do not actually allow for The Rock to relentlessly chase you around the globe in daring action sequences. The second does seem like a more entertaining concept for a movie, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P9mfj"&gt;As one might expect from a big-budget heist film, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; will also feature considerable amounts of globe-trotting action, black tie dinner parties, rooftop chases, car chases, and endless amounts of lighthearted quipping (particularly where Reynolds is concerned). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOgzkK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; is also part of Netflix’s push toward building out its original blockbuster-level films (and maybe franchises). And by putting Johnson, Gadot, and Reynolds — three of Hollywood’s biggest stars — into a single action movie, there’s a good chance that it might be Netflix’s next big hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYE3lu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; will stream on Netflix on November 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
