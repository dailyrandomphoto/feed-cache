    <title>Facebook is deleting evidence of war crimes, researchers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cs5NQaHo62vPhMuun7IFD9nCDM4=/68x0:4118x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67982681/542125066.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzKrB2"&gt;On October 24th, 2020, an art trafficker in Darnah, Libya &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATHARProject/status/1328876005201686534"&gt;posted a series of unusual ads&lt;/a&gt;. For sale: a Greco-Roman statue, its marble bust covered in a toga. If it looked like it belonged in a museum, that’s because it did. The seller posted photos of the piece in private Facebook groups dedicated to trafficking antiques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMDwFV"&gt;The black market for looted goods is flourishing on Facebook. While the company banned the sale of historical artifacts in June, many of the posts are in Arabic, and Facebook lacks the expertise to properly enforce its new policy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l-bYQLR74ndOgmUhml8aZ8PL5A4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22121780/EnEdmG3W8AUq8VG.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OOPmSh"&gt;When Facebook &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; able to identify groups that flout its guidelines, experts say the company simply deletes them, expunging crucial documentation for researchers studying stolen art. “This is critical evidence for repatriation efforts and war crimes,” says Katie Paul, co-director of the &lt;a href="http://atharproject.org/"&gt;Athar Project&lt;/a&gt;. “Facebook has created a problem and rather than turning that into something they could contribute to, they are making it worse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mm3LKX"&gt;The implications go far beyond art theft. Since 2014, looted antiques have been a major funding source for terrorist organizations like ISIS. The Middle East is rich with cultural artifacts, and the market for stolen goods isn’t as regulated as drug trafficking and arms sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gp3lCC"&gt;The seller of the Greco-Roman statue posted the ad in Facebook groups which had between 5,000 to 18,000 members. There, traffickers live stream their looting activities, giving each other tips on digging and finding buyers for pieces that are still in the ground. Athar is currently monitoring 130 groups dedicated to trafficking antiques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8ra8z"&gt;A group in Syria with 340,000 members has posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATHARProject/status/1331627522010849280"&gt;showing looters uncovering a mosaic&lt;/a&gt;. In the comments, Athar documented one user saying the mosaic shouldn’t be removed, while another responded with laughing emojis saying: “Die of hunger for the history of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f_9eAdqdzMtaWOBWW0JYYiCpOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22121782/Enrj6cZW4AI_qEw.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo courtesy of Athar Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vvo62U"&gt;The problem is particularly grave in active conflict zones where trafficking antiquities is a war crime. “It’s infuriating and problematic,” says Samuel Hardy, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute in Rome who specializes in cultural heritage and conflict. “When Facebook pulls evidence that people are self-publishing, we lose not only the ability to track the cultural property and return it to the victimized community, but also any hope of identifying and stopping the criminals who are making money from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AvdWk"&gt;Facebook isn’t the only platform struggling with how to police content while preserving evidence for research groups like Athar. &lt;a href="https://time.com/5798001/facebook-youtube-algorithms-extremism/"&gt;YouTube has also received criticism for removing extremist content&lt;/a&gt; that researchers are trying to study. While both companies will sometimes preserve evidence at the request of law enforcement, this policy doesn’t help most academic researchers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZB0di"&gt;“We’re not saying that all this content has to remain public forever,” &lt;a href="https://time.com/5798001/facebook-youtube-algorithms-extremism/"&gt;Jeff Deutch, a researcher at the Syrian Archive, told &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in relation to videos documenting human rights violations. “But it’s important that this content is archived, so it’s accessible to researchers, to human rights groups, to academics, to lawyers, for use in some kind of legal accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu9V8e"&gt;On Facebook, the issue has existed for years. Those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17121854/facebook-data-research-api-privacy-impact"&gt;trying to study the company’s ad targeting tools&lt;/a&gt; have also been frustrated by its unwillingness to share data with academics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pi9FFC"&gt;In the case of art traffickers, Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/3/6/18253922/facebook-privacy-meaning-implications-mark-zuckerberg-pivot-analysis-interface-casey-newton"&gt;pivot to privacy&lt;/a&gt; has had unintentional benefits, since criminals use secret groups and encrypted messages to conduct illicit activity. “This in turn has made Facebook the wild west of social media, providing opportunities for violent extremist organizations and criminal groups to operate in plain sight with little recourse,” &lt;a href="http://atharproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ATHAR-FB-Report-June-2019-final.pdf"&gt;Athar wrote in a report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsdJTt"&gt;Facebook would not comment on the record for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The cockroach emoji proposal is a story about texting through the apocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cockroach Emoji" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K9bQh3sI_XM6iPQiQUQWMcvcqbw=/50x0:950x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67982161/cockroach_1fab3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mjw296"&gt;A slate of new emoji was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;. Months later, they’ve finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;trickled onto most people’s phones&lt;/a&gt;... but in one case, it’s really more of a skitter. I’m talking about the cockroach, arguably the most shudder-inducing emoji of 2020 — and the product of a great little short story about the looming end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqHuio"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;my colleague Jay Peters&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18514833/picture-character-emoji-documentary-movie-unicode-tribeca"&gt;excellent 2019 documentary&lt;/a&gt; explain, anyone can submit an emoji proposal to the Unicode Consortium. The proposal must convince the consortium that many people will use the emoji in a variety of ways. And for the authors of &lt;a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19095-cockroach-emoji.pdf"&gt;the cockroach application&lt;/a&gt; — Jason Li, Melissa Thermidor, and Amanda Hickman — that includes the aftermath of a nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq8auS"&gt;It starts with a line from the opening paragraph. After noting “strong global demand” for a roach emoji, the authors casually lay out one specific scenario: preparing our culture for the death of the human race. “Adding a COCKROACH emoji would not only benefit the currently small animal-bug collection, but also ensure that if cockroaches do outlive humans in the future, at least they have an emoji too,” they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MiMtB6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If cockroaches do outlive humans in the future, at least they have an emoji too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zujhUT"&gt;The authors concede that despite popular perception, cockroaches &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t survive a nuclear war. But don’t worry — they could also reference humans who do! “COCKROACH will be a versatile emoji that can be used in a number of ways,” they reason. It could be used as “a visual signifier for a house pest,” for instance; or to symbolize “something that’s hard to get rid of”; or, naturally, “to reference a survivor in a nuclear winter.” There’s even a proposed sequence for nuclear winter itself: a cockroach, a radioactivity symbol, and a snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWDzxr"&gt;The actual story behind the symbol is more sober. Last week, Jason Li &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonli/status/1329213493086662662"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; about its road to approval, starting with his childhood in roach-ridden Hong Kong. The emoji was meant as a tribute to an “arguably cute hometown pest.” But months after its submission, Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1706106/hong-kong-police-call-protesters-cockroaches/"&gt;police began calling&lt;/a&gt; pro-democracy protesters and local bystanders “cockroaches,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonli/status/1329213539450576898"&gt;turning it into&lt;/a&gt; “an anti-protester meme of police brutality.” (There’s also an ugly history of genocidal movements &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134956180/criminals-see-their-victims-as-less-than-human"&gt;using “cockroach” as an insult&lt;/a&gt;.) Now, Li tweets that he’s got “very, very mixed feelings” about the roach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0zaVp"&gt;The Unicode Consortium application, however, continues to double as excellent science fiction. While the rest of us live in blissful ignorance, Godspeed to the people who will help us text through the apocalypse — and lace obscure bureaucratic filings with dire hints along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Get some peace and quiet with the best noise-canceling headphones for a variety of uses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PBr4KB"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an essential piece of kit during regular life when commuting to work, traveling, or if you’re trying to dull distractions at the office. But they’re also important as we continue to tally yet more weeks spent at home. It’s always nice to get a reprieve from the people you live with and be in your own private, serene bubble for a while — and noise-canceling headphones are a good way to find that peace and quiet. Since they envelop your ears, wireless headphones will always do better at erasing surrounding distractions than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;noise-canceling earbuds like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM3s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhCylT"&gt;The criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones hasn’t changed: the most important measures are how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, whether they support simultaneous pairing to multiple devices, and comfort. Aside from one general pick that does a lot of things really well, I’ve also gathered together some other recommendations if you want to stray from the popular choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="QiKAdy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9734395"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9ToLHX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A photo of Sony’s WH-1000XM4, the best noise-canceling headphones for most people, resting on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfnb67pDrZK7noQDhl7_IliL-CM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699857/IMG_0620-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are the best noise-canceling headphones for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FIBBVA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e21VnC"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YnVAr7"&gt;It took nearly two years for them to arrive, but Sony’s WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones were worth the wait. They might look identical to the previous fantastic 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ryf87h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9355782"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFvF1p"&gt;Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings. Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it’s still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the 30-hour maximum battery life. But Sony has addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued in to what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyU7Qv"&gt;There are also new features intended for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you’ve started talking. And the 1000XM4s can also tell when they’ve been removed from your ears, at which point, your audio will automatically pause. They still cost the same hefty $350, but you’re getting more for your money with the 1000XM4s than before. They will start shipping in mid-August. The &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/314elBg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous M3 headphones&lt;/a&gt; are still a fine pick even now if you can snag them at a good sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gGlUWP"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S81Mb_nBDFuDKCiKjN7p5Jm8EfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16322317/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are excellent for all your Zoom and voice call needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qq8iW7"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b7jGRn"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for videoconferencing and making calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tdSxzI"&gt;Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned. They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness. It’s really a flip of the coin between these and Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many. Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose’s support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus. The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren’t as feather-light as the company’s less expensive QC35 II headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TYQUm"&gt;When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you’ll be heard loud and clear by whoever’s on the other end, which can’t be said for all wireless headphones on this list. Bose’s microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here. Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shure’s first noise-canceling headphones offer fantastic build quality and support for codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="yj00sX"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rqLSMi"&gt;If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation. Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort. The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGZqkd"&gt;If you’re a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C. They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials. That premium feel does demand a bit more, with both of these selling for the same $400 price tag. Their noise-canceling isn’t on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Opus are the best noise-canceling headphones for around $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iJtZxh"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for around $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="b3zztw"&gt;Razer departed from its usual gaming headset formula with the noise-canceling Opus headphones, which are designed for a mainstream audience looking to spend less money than the $300 or more that Sony and Bose demand. The Opus headphones are a strong first showing, with good comfort, sturdy build quality, clear and balanced audio quality, and noise cancellation that’s a few rungs below the leaders but still performs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7RzBr"&gt;Razer omitted features like multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and you’re limited to preset EQ settings instead of having full control, but those are really the only downsides of the Opus cans. And the company did at least include auto-pause for when you take them off. As long as you don’t confuse these for gaming headphones — they’re not meant to be — you should be pleased with what Razer is offering up for at least $100 less than the big competition.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones have an on-ear design and work best with Apple devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VroSfn"&gt;The best on-ear noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ldtIVc"&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones rest on your ears instead of completely covering them, which some people might prefer. A popular choice at the gym, the Solo Pros have sweat resistance and a strong clamping force on your head so that they’ll stay put during a workout or run. As with most modern Beats headphones and earbuds, the Solo Pros are tuned to drive your day with some oomph to the bass, though they’re more well-balanced than Beats of old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jadUXW"&gt;If you use an iPhone, the Solo Pros can take advantage of Apple ecosystem features like audio sharing and the same seamless setup / pairing process as AirPods. They’ll also be getting the new spatial audio feature coming in iOS 14, which will let you get a surround sound-like experience when watching movies on your iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0phvUS"&gt;They’re not as great at noise cancellation as Bose or Sony, but the on-ear design and a snug fit help the Solo Pros offer good passive noise isolation even when NC is switched off. (You can hit up to 40 hours of battery life if you keep noise cancellation off.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 have intuitive dial controls and are a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i7fV4Q"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for ease of use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PsR02w"&gt;With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made important improvements elsewhere to sound quality and battery life. After you’ve gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you’ll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again. The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you’re at work on your PC. And now, they come in black, so you’re no longer stuck with the stale light gray color. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones have a stylish design that ties into the company’s history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mtvtN5"&gt;7. Marshall Monitor II ANC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DO2V4l"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7uR3"&gt;Marshall’s wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company’s most expensive pair is also its best yet. The Monitor II ANC headphones are priced at $320, which puts them on the same playing field as Bose, Sony, and other tech companies that have been making premium noise-canceling cans for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgMNhe"&gt;Marshall doesn’t quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise. But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company’s heritage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/24/18018074/marshall-joystick-headphone-button-control-audio-bluetooth-wireless"&gt;and the signature gold joystick&lt;/a&gt; that makes the Monitor IIs simple to control. They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you’re already someplace quiet and can do without the feature. A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I’ve enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I’ve put them on. They’re more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="B1aeyk"&gt;Buying a smartphone for under $500 is a lesson in setting priorities. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point, but luckily you will be able to buy a great phone that does the things that matter the most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qMTFV"&gt;Phones at this price point are better than ever, many coming with features that used to be reserved just for flagships. But instead of getting it all, you should think about the features that you care about and focus on finding a phone that nails them. Some phones emphasize a big screen, others a quality camera, and one of them emphasizes speed and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opZnVh"&gt;The trend of inexpensive phones getting better has been happening for a few years now, with companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung making devices that absolutely can meet your needs for less. Other companies like TCL have started trying to build their own brand by marketing directly, and OnePlus is also making a return to the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O271rc"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the Apple iPhone SE. It serves the needs of most people and does a competent job at everything, but its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77wmze"&gt;If you prefer an Android phone or are looking to spend less, then the options start to bifurcate a little bit. The Google Pixel 4A has an excellent camera and good software, but it doesn’t have the large screen many people are looking for. To get that, your best bet is Samsung’s Galaxy A51 smartphone, which does boast a big, beautiful screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAV1gP"&gt;Those phones are pretty much available worldwide, but if you’re in the markets where OnePlus has more presence, the OnePlus Nord is a newcomer that beats out the competition by hitting a higher baseline in all its categories rather than excelling at just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejzg03"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a flagship: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight As in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="2LdObD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9734342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xGSQd4"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yS33o"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJSrTq"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters because it is literally the fastest processor you can get on any phone, anywhere. It’s the exact same chip found in Apple’s $999-and-up iPhone 11 Pro. Normally speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPInwx"&gt;Battery life is good, but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, a relative rarity at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape of the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbhSVu"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIcsk"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four, five, or even six years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s clean iOS software, and huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ykrqeX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ea8Tfu"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxMxyh"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMP3dB"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgAIi6"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EQNFx"&gt;Unfortunately, in three years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbtrpB"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uLYmxs"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US right now. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jllZvZ"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high-refresh-rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMIHtL"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is solid, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzsRwZ"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQiNib"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t support the right LTE bands.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHeLLf"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n49IDp"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9zHmts"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCBvU5"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BPSfp"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReiNOy"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ot0H0"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you’d like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant OneUI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZjXl5"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;If you really think you need 5G&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WqKDDc"&gt;If you live in the US, chances are the 5G networks in your area are not going to live up to the high-flying promises carriers have been making. But if you really do think you’d benefit from 5G, the best phone under $500 that supports it is Google’s Pixel 4A 5G. At $499, it comes in just under the wire on our price limit — but the Verizon version costs an extra $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbBb7l"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great still camera, solid battery life, and clean Google software. It has some other benefits, though. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W2PnU"&gt;It also has a larger screen, clocking in at 6.2 inches diagonally. It doesn’t feel too gigantic when you hold it, but you can tell it’s a larger phone. Google chose this size not to give you that bigger screen, but because it needed the extra space to hold all the components and antennas required for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m13wf6"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajp1K5"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little Google touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K241jf"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but right now those networks still need to be built out a little bit more. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power has incredible battery life, but the rest of it isn’t so incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxVQdv"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pn815f"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uP3407"&gt;Motorola makes a pair of phones that are siblings: the G Stylus and the G Power. The difference between them is right there in the names: the G Stylus comes with a stylus and the G Power has a larger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3BFGL"&gt;We prefer the G Power because a 5,000mAh battery on a $249 phone is a shockingly good deal. You will, of course, notice a bunch of other compromises in exchange for that huge battery, but if you definitely need a phone that will last, the G Power is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pvfy9"&gt;The G Power has a 6.4-inch FHD+ display which looks decent, but it unfortunately only has 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. You’ll get by on both, but you’ll run into hassles just a bit more quickly than on phones with more. The processor is a Snapdragon 665, which will be enough to run whatever app you want, it just won’t launch it quickly and overall the phone may feel too slow in two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDBZ93"&gt;As for cameras, the G Power keeps the trend of a main sensor, an ultrawide, and a macro on the back. The main sensor is 16 megapixels and performs much better than the $250 price would lead you to expect. If you’ve used inexpensive Motorola phones before, you’ll likely find that the G Power offers a big step up in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHrfLr"&gt;If you’re very confident you want a stylus, your best bet is to see if you can find a refurbished or gently used Samsung Galaxy Note. It does a much better job providing a software ecosystem of compatible apps for its stylus. If you can’t, the G Stylus pretty much matches what we’ve said about the G Power, just with less battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aQnAQL"&gt;The phone that looks professional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="woKhbI"&gt;TCL is probably best known for its televisions, but it has served as the white label manufacturer for smartphones for many years. Now, it’s trying to make a name for itself in smartphones with new, low-cost options like the TCL 10L and the TCL 10 Pro. The Pro is the upgrade pick and retails for $449.90, though you can often find it on sale for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnR7sq"&gt;The 10 Pro looks like it means business. Instead of iridescent colors and big camera bumps, it’s thin, flat, and gray. It has a 6.47-inch display, but overall feels smaller than some phones on this list. You also get a headphone jack and a big, 4,500mAh battery that should get you through a full day without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA6Gl"&gt;The best spec on the 10 Po is its 6GB of RAM, which is plenty for multitasking and should keep your most recent apps from shutting down in the background. There’s the appropriate 128GB of storage, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQsKq"&gt;The 10 Pro’s understated looks also extend to the Android software, which has a few extra little features but generally tends to stay out of your way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6q4BYj"&gt;As for cameras, they’re somewhat uninspiring: there’s a 64-megapixel main sensor, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro. The photos you’ll get have that over-processed look that sometimes makes images look artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OWbWI"&gt;Overall, the best thing about the TCL 10 Pro is that it has plenty of RAM for multitasking and a thin shape that isn’t bombastic. If you can find a good deal on one, it’s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqJJAi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2020 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2020 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2020 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2020. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for Mac users is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195008/apple-macbook-air-review-2020-new-keyboard-processor-battery-life-camera-price"&gt;MacBook Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Apple fixed the Air’s biggest problem — the keyboard — and upgraded to more modern processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2020 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is the best laptop of 2020. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o08WOA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jR28pD"&gt;The best laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9OL54u"&gt;If you’re looking for a laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13. It features a sturdy build, 10th Gen Intel processors with powerful integrated graphics, and a nearly bezel-free 16:10 panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo9G8X"&gt;The display is what you’ll likely notice first. It has a 91.5 percent screen-to-body ratio with a bottom bezel of just 4.6mm. You can configure the XPS with a 1920 x 1200 pixel or 4K display, but the lower-resolution model should be adequate for anyone who’s not doing creative work. It delivers up to 500 nits of brightness (plenty for working in a bright room or even outdoors) and accurate, vivid colors. It’ll also give you significantly better battery life, in addition to the lower cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s28WZ3"&gt;You can customize a number of other specs; the current base model has a Core i5-1035G1, 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a 1920 x 1200 non-touch display. (There’s allegedly a model with a Core i3 and 4GB RAM floating around, but it’s not currently listed on Dell’s website. You should avoid it if you see it.) We recommend this base model to anyone who just wants to browse; if you plan on gaming or creative work, it’s worth upgrading for more storage and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hHTO4Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The latest XPS 13 excels at productivity and even has enough power for light gaming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P3jXCE"&gt;The Ice Lake processor features Intel’s new Iris Plus integrated graphics, which delivered exceptional performance for an integrated GPU. You’ll still want a discrete graphics card for serious gaming, but you’ll have no problem running lighter fare like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League. &lt;/em&gt;On those games, it delivers comparable performance to some lower-tier graphics cards, such as Nvidia’s MX150 that came in older versions of the Razer Blade Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gioe4U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505833" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eILiSH"&gt;When it comes to the other basics, the XPS beats its competition in just about every way. We got an acceptable seven hours of battery life and even three hours of light gaming. (&lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;was playable for about 85 percent of that time.) The keyboard and touchpad are among the best in their categories as well. And at just 2.8 pounds and 0.58 inches thick, it’s quite portable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbhhcH"&gt;The biggest knock against the XPS 13 is its limited port selection. With just two Thunderbolt 3 ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD slot, it’s getting into MacBook territory (though it does ship with a USB-C to USB-A dongle). The 720p webcam is also pretty terrible, though, in Dell’s defense, it had to squeeze the thing into a 2.25mm top bezel.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jEkaV"&gt;These are legitimate concerns that may drive some users to look elsewhere. But for most users, they won’t be as important as the fundamentals: build quality, keyboard, touchpad, display, and performance. The XPS excels in all of those areas, earning it our top recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnB0cF"&gt;Dell recently released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21456034/dell-xps-13-2in1-2020-features-price-release-date"&gt;new version of the XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with Intel’s 11th-Gen Tiger Lake processors. It starts at $999. We’ll be reviewing that shortly, and will update this page to let you know how it compares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L8pJhA"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GKEDzx"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin and light chassis, and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: The new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Raedon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air is the best laptop for Mac users. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aPQg4I"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195008/apple-macbook-air-review-2020-new-keyboard-processor-battery-life-camera-price"&gt;MacBook Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop for Mac users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TTZ97L"&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air is the best option for most people who prefer the Apple ecosystem. The Air comes with 10th Gen Intel processors (though in a lower power variation than the XPS 13), a sharp Retina display, and a new scissor-switch keyboard. The base configuration (including a Core i3, 8GB RAM, and 256GB storage) comes in under $1,000, but we recommend that you go for, at minimum, the upgraded model with a Core i5 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7NICD"&gt;MacBook keyboards have been almost universally maligned for the past few years. But the 2020 Air inherited the new-and-improved keyboard from the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which brings back the “inverted T” arrow layout and keys with 1mm of travel. There’s no Touch Bar, but that’s a controversial feature already, and most users should be fine with the standard top row and function keys. It does retain the Touch ID fingerprint scanner for easy logins and payment authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bZabCT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The MacBook Air is the default Apple laptop for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEpmEO"&gt;You can configure the Air with three different Y-series chips, maxing out at a 1.2GHz quad-core Core i7. We had no problem with the 1.1GHz Core i5, though; it handled Chrome, Slack, Zoom, and Lightroom just fine, and had single-threaded Geekbench scores in line with those of the 16-inch MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcULBm"&gt;Where you might run into trouble is with heavy workloads that need to run for long periods of time, such as rendering graphics or exporting video. We witnessed some thermal throttling in these cases, and clock speeds were capped at less than half of the processor’s boost. That means if you’re doing heavy creative work or other tasks that really push the CPU, you’re likely to experience slowdown and a very loud fan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D7dwP5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CkuvWk"&gt;The MacBook Air does have a few other significant weaknesses. The primary one is battery life. We got about five hours using a workflow of Chrome, Slack, Zoom, and Lightroom with the screen on maximum brightness. You’ll probably get more juice if you dim the screen and stick with Apple’s apps, but we expect most people will want to keep the brightness high (it only gets up to 400 nits), and third-party programs are necessities for many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7hg5"&gt;Despite those downsides, though, the MacBook Air will serve as a competent and reliable device for most users. It has the excellent design, display, performance, and (finally) keyboard that we expect from Apple. Power users who need the Pro probably know who they are; everyone else should be just fine with the Air. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ff7WtW"&gt;Our favorite 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BGSdq5"&gt;The Spectre x360 is a premium-level 2-in-1 Windows laptop with the latest processor options from Intel, a vibrant touchscreen, and more port options than are found on other laptops in this segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL9pqG"&gt;The x360 weighs less than three pounds and is about two-thirds of an inch thick when closed, which makes it very easy to travel with. The latest model has a smaller footprint than before, thanks to shrunken bezels above and below the screen, but it still maintains a full-size keyboard and spacious trackpad. In addition, it provides both facial and fingerprint biometric authentication, so you can choose which way you prefer to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQyU1"&gt;HP updated the trackpad drivers it uses in the latest model to Microsoft’s Precision set and the experience is improved over the older versions to the point where it’s no longer an issue. The x360’s trackpad is now right up there with the best Windows trackpad options (which are still a tick behind what you get on a MacBook) in terms of scrolling, multifinger gestures, and palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msO0V8"&gt;The biggest argument against the x360 is that it has a 16:9 display, as opposed to the 16:10 or 3:2 screens you’ll find on Dell or Microsoft’s computers. Those taller aspect ratios are much better for productivity work, whether that’s working in two documents side by side or researching on the web without having to scroll as much. But unless you are very particular about your screen’s aspect ratio, most people won’t find this to be a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XYBklz"&gt;If you’re looking for a MacBook that’s more powerful than the Air, but isn’t as pricey as the 16-inch Pro, the MacBook Pro 13 hits the sweet spot in the middle. It has a bright 500-nit screen, excellent speakers and — finally — a keyboard that’s actually reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGeBR6"&gt;There are two models you can consider depending on your needs: the “base” model has 8th-Gen Intel processors and two Thunderbolt 3 processors, while the pricier version has 10th-Gen processors and four Thunderbolt 3 ports (as well as 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD). If you can afford it, we recommend stepping up to the pricier version, as the performance difference between the two generations is noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;The 17-inch laptop to buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GAaGi6"&gt;The XPS 17 is a workstation for professionals who need a huge screen and huge power. Its 17-inch 3840 x 2400 display allows you room to comfortably work in multiple tabs and apps, and it’s also bright enough to use for outdoor work without much obtrusive glare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEG0dl"&gt;It contains H-series Intel processors, and can be configured with discrete RTX GPUs — our model had an RTX 2060 Max Q. That system flew through gaming benchmarks and complex video work — and didn’t burn itself up in the process, thanks to a new cooling system from Dell that includes a chassis-wide vapor chamber. Best of all, those specs and screen manage to function without decimating the XPS’s battery life; our unit (with a 97Wh brick) was able to last a full work day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday laptop deals</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyS-btz2pHUF5jwkZM8n-LfUTnw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67870192/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yLHtZ"&gt;Whether you’re shopping for a student, an older relative, or anyone in between, a laptop can make a great gift. And the internet’s largest retailers are offering all kinds of laptops at discounted prices this Black Friday, whether you’re looking for a convertible, a Chromebook, a gaming rig, or anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8Tv9N"&gt;Note that for some models, only certain configurations may be on sale. Make sure to double-check the specs of the item you’re buying to make sure they’ll suit your workload (and that you’re actually getting the discount) before you check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vRrnV"&gt;To learn more about some of these laptops, and others that may see discounts later this week, check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops of 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dpI62t"&gt;HP deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jIzyzH"&gt;A number of HP laptops are on sale through Best Buy’s online store. One of them is the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724673736170934495" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Envy x360 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;, a portable convertible laptop that offers exceptional value for its price.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ChVeT"&gt;Black Friday week has arrived, and that means you can pick up some Microsoft products at their lowest prices of the year. Whether you’re looking for Surface Pro tablets, Xbox accessories, Windows laptops, or PC games, you’ll find discounts left and right at the Microsoft Store and other retailers such as Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfxgj6"&gt;We’ve collected the best deals you can find on Microsoft products, and they’re all significantly lower-than-usual prices. We’ve also included some deals on Windows computers that are available for a good price. As more deals appear as the big day approaches, we’ll add them to this post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lR4HdB"&gt;If you’re looking for even more Black Friday sales, be sure to check out our article &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;rounding up all of the best deals&lt;/a&gt; across a variety of categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9Wb6Cm"&gt;Black Friday is a great time to shop for laptops and tablets. Microsoft is already offering discounts on several of its Surface laptop devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErRiRb"&gt;For one: you can save on every Surface Pro 7 model. The Surface Pro Signature Type Cover (which you’ll want to buy if you want to use the Pro 7 as a laptop, rather than just a tablet) is also discounted, and the sleeve (which you can use protect the thing in your backpack or briefcase) is being thrown in for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1n9ter"&gt;The base model (which includes an Intel Core i3, 4GB of memory, and a 128GB SSD) is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724701928825290445" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $599 ($360 off the original price of $959). Some other models are discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen/dp/B07YNJGMH6/?tag=digitren08-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=1606249211eee09978&amp;amp;sid=1606249211eee09978" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Pro-7-12-3-Touch-Screen-Intel-Core-i5-1035G4-8GB-Memory-128GB-SSD-Iris-Plus-Graphics-Windows-10-Home-Platinum-Black-Type-Cover-QWU-%2F788518695" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Touch-Screen/dp/B07YNHZ9ZN/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=surface+laptop&amp;amp;qid=1602426177&amp;amp;sr=8-14&amp;amp;tag=digitren08-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=160624921035bc6070&amp;amp;sid=160624921035bc6070" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724702001165865975" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NfdM3f"&gt;Windows laptop deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ioT0Pq"&gt;A number of other laptops that run Windows are discounted if you buy them through the Microsoft Store. A solid purchase is the Razer Blade Pro 17, one of the most powerful portable gaming laptops you can buy, which is $200 off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prolonged AWS outage has taken down a big chunk of the internet</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38BiUpaf5rNCVTxeTdgtQZGvWUg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67981718/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HuDA7K"&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s internet infrastructure service that is the backbone of many websites and apps, is experiencing a major outage affecting a large portion of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfptS9"&gt;“Kinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that’s impacted some other AWS services,” Amazon said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are working toward resolution.” And, ironically, in a notice on the &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AWS Service Health Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said the issue has apparently “affected our ability to post updates” to that dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndtWV1"&gt;“We continue to work towards recovery of the issue affecting the Kinesis Data Streams API in the US-EAST-1 Region,” Amazon said in a 1:47PM ET update posted to the dashboard. “For Kinesis Data Streams, the issue is affecting the subsystem that is responsible for handling incoming requests. The team has identified the root cause and is working on resolving the issue affecting this subsystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLq5gC"&gt;It seems the issue is fairly widespread, as a number of apps and services have posted on Twitter about how the AWS outage is affecting them, including Roku, Flickr, Adobe Spark, Spotify-owned Anchor, Glassdoor, Getaround, and iRobot. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PhillyInquirer/status/1331666628480819206"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TB_Times/status/1331670859598147585"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/capgaznews/status/1331659304835936256"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capital Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also said that they are having issues with publishing stories due to the outage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: collaborative NYT crosswords return to Twitch over the holiday weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="crossword" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jjT7dOlH01raMe4wrvxef_UPg10=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67981642/2605420727_3d93cb8e9e_b.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxfHAJ"&gt;It’s your first (and hopefully last) Thanksgiving holiday during a pandemic, and you might be looking for some kind of outlet for your newfound stress. Well, you’re in luck: &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Games is streaming collaborative crosswords &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nytgames"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qg0jGP"&gt;This collaborative take on the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s online crosswords works kind of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8281669/twitch-plays-pokemon-finally-captures-all-151-monsters"&gt;Twitch Plays &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, relying on chat inputs from viewers watching the stream. (Of course, in this case, you’re entering in crossword answers rather than picking moves in a pokémon battle.) Commands are formatted like “23d barn” meaning “the answer for 23 down is barn.” From there, the game is smart enough to select the correct boxes and fill them in. It’s designed by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samvonehren?lang=en"&gt;Sam Von Ehren&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; game designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VDoIdX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=nytgames&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJmank"&gt;The game will run starting today through Thanksgiving and Black Friday, and Von Ehren expects that he’ll “probably stop it at some point on Saturday,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rj2xtg"&gt;You might have heard about these collaborative crosswords before — Von Ehren hosted an initial version of the game on his personal Twitch channel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/3/21548163/twitch-crossword-puzzle-solve-together-nyt"&gt;on Election Day&lt;/a&gt;. The game has since been updated to be faster, more stable, and better able to understand answers in the chat, Von Ehren tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. This newly updated version can also handle multiple rebuses, which is the rare occasion when multiple boxes in a puzzle hold two letters rather than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQjb0Z"&gt;Check it out now above or &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nytgames"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
