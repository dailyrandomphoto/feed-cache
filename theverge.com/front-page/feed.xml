    <title>Taiwan’s government is letting its tech giants TSMC and Foxconn buy COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biontech vaccine vial is seen infornt of syringes during a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PxWIRXa1mBoza3zf2Tpfy6Hixqw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471018/1233487764.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8zyXg"&gt;Last year, Taiwan was held up as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/10/21171722/taiwan-coronavirus-china-social-distancing-quarantine"&gt;a model example&lt;/a&gt; of how to control the pandemic. Now, with a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-reports-new-rise-domestic-covid-19-cases-2021-05-29/"&gt;rising case-count&lt;/a&gt; threatening the country’s vital tech industry in the middle of a global semiconductor shortage, its government is letting its powerful corporations buy COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf. It’s an unusual workaround, but one that makes sense given Taiwan’s complaints that China &lt;a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-says-beijing-blocked-deal-with-biontech-for-covid-19-shots"&gt;scuppered earlier deals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFkMBZ"&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/TSMC-and-Foxconn-cleared-to-buy-COVID-vaccines-for-Taiwan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-founder-asks-taiwan-allow-vaccine-talks-with-chinese-firm-2021-06-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Taiwanese government said on Friday that it would allow chipmaker TSMC and Terry Gou, billionaire founder of tech assembly giant Foxconn, to negotiate on its behalf with vaccine makers. Both TSMC and Gou (who will be working through his Yonglin Education Foundation) said they hope to buy around 5 million vaccines each from Germany’s BioNTech and donate them to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On6hHi"&gt;Whether or not this approach will succeed is unclear. “The government thinks that it may be easier for companies to reach out to vaccine makers or distributors to lower the geopolitical interference,” one source told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y5ZKVm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;can he get them to sell sufficient vaccines? Honestly, nobody knows”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pGPnpg"&gt;But Taiwan’s cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng was more cautious, telling reporters: “Even if Mr. Gou can discuss this with the original manufacturer or an agent, can he get them to sell sufficient vaccines? Honestly, nobody knows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acaOhj"&gt;TSMC and Foxconn are lynchpins of both global tech supply chains and Taiwan’s economy. Together, the firms account for more 30 percent of island’s stock exchange by market capitalization, according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. The global pandemic has created a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;worldwide shortage in chip supplies&lt;/a&gt;, leading to rising prices and missing stock for everything from PS5s to Teslas. Such problems could worsen if cases spike among Taiwan’s workers, forcing factory shutdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTE2zH"&gt;Taiwan has a population of around 23 million, but only around six percent of the island’s inhabitants have received even a single dose of coronavirus vaccine, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. The work of vaccinating the island has been complicated by geopolitical tensions. China considers the democratically-governed Taiwan to be a breakaway province that it wishes to exert full political control over. The US is one of the biggest obstacles to this integration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyRJ06"&gt;Taiwan’s own government and sympathetic US senators &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/17/why-america-should-help-taiwan-get-vaccines/"&gt;say China has interfered &lt;/a&gt;with the island’s attempts to secure vaccines. In response, the US has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-working-deliver-vaccines-taiwan-short-order-2021-06-17/"&gt;promised to donate&lt;/a&gt; 750,000 shots to Taiwan “in very short order” while Japan has already exceeded this promise, donating 1.24 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/11/japan-injects-vaccine-diplomacy-into-the-taiwan-straits"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nObJL"&gt;With cases of coronavirus rising, though, it seems Taiwan’s government is unwilling to simply wait on the largesse of its geopolitical allies. Instead, it’s hoping that its own corporations can assist in purchasing the much-needed shots.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify acquires podcast discovery specialists Podz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0PnGC8XMqIAjqYO4Oq2Goe8A1Sk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69470963/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="drwtPp"&gt;Spotify has acquired Podz, a startup whose technology generates preview clips of podcasts, the streaming service &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-06-17/spotify-accelerates-podcast-discovery-with-acquisition-of-podz/"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other services podcasters can use to manually create clips, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; Podz automates the process of finding key moments from episodes using machine learning trained on over 100,000 hours of audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygBlgg"&gt;The acquisition is aimed at improving podcast discovery, letting users browse short clips rather than 30-minute plus podcast episodes. Spotify says this will make it “easier for listeners to find the content they want to listen to, and for creators to be discovered and build a fan base.” Podz tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that users on its platform typically follow up to 30 podcasts, up from an average of seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ShtsG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making it “easier for listeners to find the content they want to listen to”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTHNwi"&gt;The acquisition follows Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;subscription podcasting announcement&lt;/a&gt;, in which it would allow select partners to charge for access to their content. Although Spotify isn’t planning on taking its 5 percent cut of subscription revenue until 2023, eventually it’ll have a direct financial incentive to encourage its listeners to find and subscribe to as many podcasts as possible. Especially since it’s now competing with Apple Podcasts’ own in-app subscriptions, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534960/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-channels-shows-app"&gt;launched this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TevRIx"&gt;Spotify says it plans to integrate Podz’ technology into its platform, and that some of the results should be visible before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Quest update adds multitasking and wireless streaming for original headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y42QIm0dET-f9EWBTkJBMLXiTX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69470886/akrales_190429_3371_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nrQSLO"&gt;Facebook is rolling out its v30 update to the Oculus Quest and Quest 2 VR headsets. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535772/oculus-quest-vr-air-link-wireless-pc-streaming-original"&gt;previewed earlier this week by Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, v30 includes a new multitasking interface for Infinite Office that lets you put multiple apps side by side, including the browser, Oculus TV, Oculus Move, the store, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7QY38"&gt;Like many new Oculus Quest features, it’ll be found in the Experimental section of the settings menu at first. Once multitasking is enabled, apps can be dragged up from the menu bar or the apps library and snapped into position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ghr33H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2QwKws"&gt;The v30 update also enables Air Link for the original Quest headset. Air Link &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400197/oculus-quest-2-air-link-pc-streaming-v28-launch"&gt;came to the Quest 2 in April&lt;/a&gt; and allows you to stream VR games from your PC to your headset wirelessly, as opposed to Oculus Link which does the same thing over a USB-C cable. Original Quest owners could previously stream PC games wirelessly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;with the third-party app Virtual Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9omQ5q"&gt;Other new features include the addition of an accessibility tab to the settings menu that, among other things, allows for height adjustment, so that games can be experienced from a standing viewpoint while seated. Oculus has also added the ability to switch the headset’s built-in microphone between system-wide party chat and the app you’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k87zQS"&gt;As ever, the update might not hit your headset immediately due to the staggered rollout process, but Facebook &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fmultitasking-accessibility-improvements-and-air-link-for-quest-1-in-the-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator adds beautiful Nordic views in its latest update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_1ggh8XOX4FJOl7wHdxw0gkzl0=/121x0:1272x767/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469615/flight_sim1700.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator | Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J049db"&gt;Just in time for the launch of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;on Xbox Series consoles next month&lt;/a&gt;, developer Asobo Studios has added some extra details that players will appreciate. World Update V is focused on the Nordic region (specifically Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden), bringing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1405543549232316422"&gt;stunning vistas&lt;/a&gt; to an already visually impressive title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AVPs0J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hgaj4NGVfR0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4VeFIG"&gt;A brief trailer shows the payoff for some extra attention on landscapes (so many fjords) and urban areas with detailed architecture for you to fly around showing off everything from ancient castles to modern stadiums, towers and bridges. According to the team, the new areas include “100 airports and 77 carefully selected points of interest.” You can see Lego House and Frederiksborg Castle in the trailer, along with the Arctic Cathedral and Sarek National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNT1Rc"&gt;The Xbox launch is timed for July 27th, arriving after several updates to optimize the game and even &lt;a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/release-notes-1-16-2-0-sim-update-iv-now-available/"&gt;reduce its staggering initial installation size&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a capable PC you can install this latest update for free — it’s also localized in Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish if you’d like the full Nordic experience — while Xbox One owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-games-on-xbox-one-xcloud-streaming"&gt;wait for cloud streaming&lt;/a&gt; to bring high-end titles their way later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet’s hand-raising feature is getting a more visible animation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86LZ_CVdIRbuu6EQpFUHSMn6jvg=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469597/Google_Meet_1.max_2000x2000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IgVCNN"&gt;Google Meet, Google’s answer to video calling services like Zoom, is getting a collection of helpful tweaks to its &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/06/improvements-to-hand-raise-in-google.html"&gt;hand-raising feature&lt;/a&gt; as part of ongoing updates to Workspace. The new changes, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/17/google-meet-hand-raise/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include a new hand-raising animation, notification sound, and adjustments to how hosts are made aware of raised hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBA62g"&gt;While the update is minor, for anyone who uses Google Meet in a large group setting or regularly attends webinars, the tweaks will be helpful — plus, the new animation really is nice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZrFhWZNNP8G46g1CT-PRX7OQcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22666118/NewVisualIconAndAnimationWhenSomeoneRaisesHand.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new hand-raising animation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ap8m1Q"&gt;Here’s Google’s breakdown of the changes you’ll notice as the update rolls out to Workspace users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BqOXst"&gt;An updated and improved visual icon and animation on the video tile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9unsK8"&gt;The tiles of people with raised hands may be moved to be more visible in the video grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IOpTFh"&gt;An audio notification for all participants when the first raised hand is raised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k9Olcx"&gt;A clickable notification which shows the number of raised hands and which links to an ordered queue of all participants with raised hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcatlH"&gt;That a participant’s hand will be automatically lowered after they speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mCi3ro"&gt;Google says the new feature will be available for any meeting created by hosts with Workspace Essentials, Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Fundamentals, Education Plus, Nonprofit, and G Suite Business accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGitDO"&gt;For the more exciting changes to Workspace announced at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;I/O 2021 Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to wait a bit longer. Google just rolled out Workspace to anyone with a Google account and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;enabled its new Chat and Rooms features&lt;/a&gt; (replacements for G Chat and Slack). Bigger changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates"&gt;like smart chips&lt;/a&gt;, which makes all Workspace apps more interoperable and fluid, are still a ways off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG Mobile returns to India after ban with green blood and a new name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PUBG" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1gGveoX3CyRvMgpbBhID5jdxlBE=/124x0:1474x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469278/PUBG_Mohawk.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5R67N"&gt;Massively popular battle royale game &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjt-vv5w5_xAhUBip4KHSMcBVkQFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350782%2Fpubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3cSh1JYadGTB5sQZIxOuAH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is returning to India after being banned in September 2020, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/battlegrounds-mobile-pubg-returns-to-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. The app is available in early access on Google’s Play Store under a new name, &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds Mobile India, &lt;/em&gt;and with some changes to the game itself, like green blood and a new account system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFTlAP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418120/pubg-mobile-india-ban-118-apps-china-alipay-baidu"&gt;initially banned&lt;/a&gt; alongside hundreds of other apps because of connections to Chinese companies — in this game’s case, it was major video game investor Tencent. At the time of the ban, PUBG Studio (owned by the larger South Korean company Krafton) announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562107/pubg-mobile-india-launch-ban-data-localization-cybersecurity-concerns"&gt;it would relaunch in the region&lt;/a&gt; with new features customized for Indian gamers, including the color change to blood, and framing the game explicitly as a “virtual simulation training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eu9QZb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; writes that beyond modified bodily fluids — part of a long tradition of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/13/20812985/nearly-30-years-ago-mortal-kombats-blood-forever-changed-the-video-game-industry"&gt;censoring depictions of violence&lt;/a&gt; in games — and reminders that the game isn’t real, &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds &lt;/em&gt;seems to be the same as &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. There’s apparently even a way to easily transfer your account from the older game to the new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgjMDx"&gt;The really consequential changes may be less visible. The Indian government’s major justification for the ban was that it had concerns about where users’ data was transmitted, with the idea that it was not comfortable having that data sent to places outside of India (read: China). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdIrjO"&gt;Ahead of its planned relaunch, PUBG Studio announced it was severing ties with Tencent in India and moving the game’s hosting to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/pubg-mobile-plots-return-to-india-following-ban/"&gt;Microsoft Azure data centers&lt;/a&gt; in the country, which may have solved the matter well before any green blood did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sOHPp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9ydXO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFLoQE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDK7Q7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faAbus"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available through Sony’s store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xS5CiNMvEijE7WtcR5T9S8X8bM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467646/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ww7DNc"&gt;More than six months after its initial debut, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; remains as elusive as ever. Sony also expects console shortages to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;stretch into 2022&lt;/a&gt;, however, at 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT, both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition will be available at Sony’s store. &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=hsm0u2oyux&amp;amp;ver=v3-javascript-3.6.3&amp;amp;cver=281&amp;amp;man=PS%20Direct%20Prod%20KU%20Action&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fhardware%2Fps5&amp;amp;kupver=akamai-1.0.2"&gt;You can head to that site right now&lt;/a&gt;, and the page will automatically toss you into the queue to (hopefully) secure a PS5 from the batch being released into the wild today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcPHQX"&gt;Sony says that you don’t need to refresh the page, but make sure that you stick around once the queue begins because it’ll likely ask you at some point to verify that you’re still present, or else you might be booted from the queue. If it’s your first time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;welcome to the needless drama involved with buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVpQBa"&gt;So, what’s the difference between the two models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA6hbH"&gt;The standard PS5 ($499.99) and the Digital Edition ($399.99) are nearly identical, aside from the obvious. The standard console features a UHD Blu-ray disc drive whereas the latter does not, meaning you’ll need to download or stream anything you want to watch or play. The Digital Edition also features a slimmer, lighter build because of this, however, keep in that the size difference is slight. Both consoles also sport an 825GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0F29IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7hBTYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zFuNf"&gt;If you do manage to purchase a PS5, there are a few games and additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony"&gt;accessories we suggest you pick up&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736382577329371434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D Headset&lt;/a&gt;, the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, and the best PS5 exclusive released thus far: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Returnal-PlayStation-5/dp/B08QFPS48J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AasZjK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JTGN3h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nefQI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;In addition to the accessories above, we also recommend buying an &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so gives you access to online multiplayer, a selection of free monthly titles, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to play a host of PlayStation 4 classics on your PS5 at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nielsen takes another crack at gauging our streaming habits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixZlBfxHHHl600qt8BeBYaebhM0=/0x5:3500x2338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469134/1193665393.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u2oq5J"&gt;Nielsen, the nearly century-old research firm which produces the eponymous gold standard for television ratings, is taking a more serious look into how much Americans are streaming. The result of its labors: an ominously named rating system it calls The Gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRAy8P"&gt;While Nielsen has tried to calculate the popularity of various streaming programs before (through &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nielsen-to-measure-netflix-viewing-1416357093"&gt;audio analysis&lt;/a&gt;), The Gauge seems to hew closer to the ways Nielsen has measured TV viewership in the past: via a device which, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/business/media/nielsen-streaming-metrics.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “observes internet traffic that passes through a router.” Presumably, this device is attached directly to the televisions of the roughly 14,000 homes from which The Gauge currently gathers data, as the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; once again reports that the measurement does “not count what is watched on phones or laptops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJWv0I"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nielsen.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Finsights%2Farticle%2F2021%2Fthe-gauge-shows-streaming-takes-a-seat-at-the-table%2F%3Futm_campaign%3DNielsen_Audience_Measurement%26utm_medium%3DReferral%26utm_source%3DTwitter%26utm_content%3DGauge%26utm_id%3DINF_06_18_2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22539071%2Fnielson-the-gauge-streaming-metrics-televisions-netflix-hulu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;initial findings&lt;/a&gt; for May 2021, perhaps unsurprisingly then, skew in favor of regular old network and cable TV, which Nielsen predicts we spend about 64 percent of our living room screentime watching. Streaming, in total, racked up just 26 percent, with YouTube and Netflix making up 6 percent each, followed by Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Disney Plus with 3, 2, and 1 percent, respectively. But again, this is only measuring TV screen usage — not what’s happening on laptop, desktop, phone, or tablet screens — and even these metrics are difficult to put into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYy_OF1wGDAQagML1MYnM7X44Q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665880/the_gauge.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nielsen&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CEnPsD"&gt;Without much information on how Nielsen’s device works, it’s impossible to say if The Gauge is counting streams that might come through a streaming set-top box or gaming console that has its own internet connectivity and a physical connection to the TV — or, for that matter, streams from a secondary device that are cast to a TV. (We’ve reached out to Nielsen for additional details.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cdUi4"&gt;Still, streaming services have shown themselves to be guarded where audience metrics are concerned, releasing next to no data on how many eyeballs their in-house shows or the content they pay to license receive. Netflix in particular has a reputation for being &lt;a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/every-viewing-statistic-netflix-has-released-so-far-june-2021/"&gt;extremely selective&lt;/a&gt; in which titles it presents audience data for, and even then rarely providing more granular information such as whether viewers &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/the-irishman-26-million-people-in-first-week-netflix-says-1203431387/"&gt;actually finished watching the damn thing&lt;/a&gt;. In that sense, The Gauge is a welcome change for an industry that’s enjoyed a very long stretch without transparency. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X is available at Walmart (Update: Sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIwq8urp9JpLCnY1pX0PTUYSq4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468484/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUkRVV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 17th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart appears to have sold out of Series X consoles for today. I hope that you got one!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrtRXv"&gt;Microsoft’s next-gen console may have arrived, but getting your hands on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; isn’t exactly easy. Much like the PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s console remains in short supply due to increased demand and ongoing chip shortages, a problem that will likely extend into 2022. Thankfully, if you haven’t managed to secure either console, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=NextGenRestocks4152021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Series X is available at Walmart right now for $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. (Walmart is releasing new waves of consoles every 10 minutes for now, so check again if you strike out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i7fA5"&gt;If you’re not sure how the Series X differs from the more affordable but weaker Series S console, there a few things to consider. First, unlike the Series S, the Series X features a 4K UHD Blu-ray drive, which allows it to play physical games and other media. The Series X also has a 1TB SSD instead of the 512GB SSD found on the Series S, and it renders games in native 4K at 60fps. The Series S targets it 1440p and features a slimmer build, but otherwise, the machines are essentially the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p6l6Py"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ykqbO"&gt;If you do manage to pick up either console, there are a few more accessories to consider if you want to make the most of your next-gen console. Although the highly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;was pushed&lt;/a&gt; to an undisclosed date in the fall, popular Xbox One titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-XBOX-ONE/dp/B087XPDJ5M/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassins Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have received graphical updates designed to leverage Microsoft’s next-gen hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oTNqbi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10248487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WUNtXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10529051"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rfc713"&gt;If you don’t mind playing older titles, we also suggest picking up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to more than 100 first- and third-party titles, an EA Play membership, discounts, and all the perks that come with Xbox Live Gold. A subscription to Game Pass Ultimate also grants you access to Xbox Game Studios titles the same day they’re released, meaning you’ll be able to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GfRvRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple cuts AppleCare Plus prices for M1 MacBook Air and Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bHoXLNe9BbbQvSkGrwGLCtMf80A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69468924/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RufUhu"&gt;Apple is cutting the prices for its AppleCare Plus extended warranty for both its M1 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FS9750LL%2FA%2Fapplecare-for-macbook-air&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538595%2Fapple-applecare-plus-price-cut-m1-macbook-air-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; and MacBook Pro laptops. AppleCare for the new M1 Air now costs $199 (versus the old $249 price), while &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FS9733LL%2FA%2Fapplecare-for-13-inch-macbook-pro-m1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538595%2Fapple-applecare-plus-price-cut-m1-macbook-air-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AppleCare for the M1 Pro&lt;/a&gt; is down $20 to $249, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/17/applecare-prices-lowered-for-m1-macbook-air-pro/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ki8zbO"&gt;If you’ve got an Intel-based laptop, those price cuts are a mixed bag. Apple is applying the $199 price for the MacBook Air to both the M1 and Intel-based models, even though it no longer directly sells the Intel Airs. If you’ve got an Intel-based Pro, on the other hand (which Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; still offer, at least for now), you won’t be getting any discount — AppleCare Plus &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FS9761LL%2FA%2Fapplecare-for-13-inch-macbook-pro-intel&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538595%2Fapple-applecare-plus-price-cut-m1-macbook-air-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for that model&lt;/a&gt; will still cost the same $269 as before. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHKLah"&gt;AppleCare Plus for Macs extends the 90 days of coverage included with a new laptop to three years. It also gives users two damage replacements every 12 months, with an additional charge of $99 for replacing the screen or outside of the laptop, or a $299 for “other damage.” Those fees are on top of the initial AppleCare Plus fee that customers pay upfront, but given that Apple’s laptops start at $999, it’s the sort of thing that could save money in the long run if you’re particularly accident prone. &lt;/p&gt;
