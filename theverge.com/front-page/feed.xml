    <title>Pinterest is adding search filters for different hair textures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a Pinterest search for “summer hairstyles” showing filter options for protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight, and shave/ bald.

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinterest’s new hair pattern search feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pinterest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqWv7P"&gt;Pinterest is launching a search tool to help people narrow their hair inspiration searches by hair pattern. When users search for hairstyles, new filter options — for coily, curly, wavy, and straight textures, as well as shaved / bald and protective styles — will appear under the search bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkFGFb"&gt;The filters should be particularly useful for people of color looking for styles tailored to their hair textures, and Pinterest says they were created with Black, brown, and Latinx people in mind. “Just the simple idea that I don’t have to work twice as hard to find a hairstyle because of my hair type is a game changer,” says Naeemah LaFond, an editorial hair stylist and global artistic director of the Amika hair care brand, who advised Pinterest during the feature’s development. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif showing “summer hairstyles” being typed into Pinterest search and bringing up different pins under the protective and coily filters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWjlvJ-5kDSkIVoUtHrXmiD2IxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787824/Hair_Pattern_Search_Mobile_GIF.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I1wF90"&gt;The new feature builds on Pinterest’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17286898/pinterest-skin-tone-search-filter-results-feature-update"&gt;skin tone search filters&lt;/a&gt;, which were introduced in 2018. To make those filters, Pinterest engineers started with data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131260/loreal-modiface-acquire-makeup-ar-try-on"&gt;ModiFace’s&lt;/a&gt; AI library, adjusting the algorithm from there to improve things like its ability to properly categorize skin tones in low light. Pinterest has made improvements to its in-house tech since then, saying it’s now “three times as likely to detect multiple skin tone ranges in top search results, compared to previous technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PPAQp"&gt;Pinterest says the hair pattern feature uses “computer vision-powered object detection” to determine which hair types are shown in hairstyle pins.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We built hair pattern search with in-house AI on top of our foundational computer vision technology that is used in visual search and shopping,” says a Pinterest spokesperson. The company says its algorithm has detected hair patterns in over 500 million images on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1zrR9"&gt;Hair pattern search will be rolling out across desktop, iOS, and Android apps over the coming weeks, says Pinterest. The filters will be available in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand first, before expanding to other countries in the coming months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZrEkU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 18th, 11:02 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added details about Pinterest’s in-house skin tone and hair pattern detection tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Water shortages loom over future semiconductor fabs in Arizona </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southwest Faces Worsening Drought Conditions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K5faOSmwGsZzZYe4pYwEKiq4nss=/2x0:4999x3331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741646/1233861592.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In an aerial view. an empty water trough in the desert that has been recently visited by wild burros is seen on July 7, 2021 near Yucca, Arizona. Large portions of the West are now classified as being in exceptional drought, the most extreme drought category.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by David McNew/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZLAKw"&gt;Major semiconductor manufacturers looking to expand in Arizona will likely be spared from water cuts induced by an unprecedented water shortage in the Southwest, at least for now.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As part of the scramble to end a shortage of another kind — the global dearth in semiconductor chips — both Intel and TSMC plan to open new facilities in Arizona. But they’re setting up shop just as one of the worst droughts in decades grows worse across the Western US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k33XbY"&gt;Federal authorities officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;declared a shortage&lt;/a&gt; on the Colorado River for the first time ever this week, which will trigger water cuts in several states and Mexico starting January 1st, 2022. The shortage is at the Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US and a huge source of water for Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5GdcRX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A factory or “fab” for making semiconductors needs a lot of water&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XzQCq8"&gt;How the planned water cuts shake out depends on who is given top priority under a complex set of water-sharing agreements. Arizona, with more junior rights to the water than other states it shares it with, will suffer the biggest cuts, losing about &lt;a href="https://www.cap-az.com/water/cap-water/planning-and-processes/shortage-impacts/"&gt;8 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the total water it receives a year. But for now, those cuts will primarily affect agriculture, which used more than 70 percent of the state’s water &lt;a href="http://www.arizonawaterfacts.com/water-your-facts"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Water for tribes, municipal use, and industry are given higher &lt;a href="https://www.cap-az.com/water/cap-water/planning-and-processes/shortage-impacts/"&gt;priority&lt;/a&gt; in the state, shielding residents and companies unless a more severe water shortage is eventually declared at Lake Mead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWIreR"&gt;A factory or “fab” for making semiconductors needs a lot of water to operate. It’ll guzzle between 2 to 4 million gallons of water a day by some &lt;a href="https://engineeredenvironment.tumblr.com/post/30464844411/water-use-in-the-semiconductor-manufacturing"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;, using the water to cool down equipment and clean silicon wafers. That’s about as much water as 13,698 to 27,397 Arizona residents might use &lt;a href="https://new.azwater.gov/conservation/public-resources"&gt;in a day&lt;/a&gt;. Fabs are also pretty picky when it comes to water quality, they need to use “ultra-pure” water to prevent any impurities from damaging the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyAmjB"&gt;Industries in the state used up 6 percent of Arizona’s water in 2019, but that could grow as chipmakers and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-southwest-is-americas-new-factory-hub-cranes-everywhere-11622554044"&gt;other manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; move in. In &lt;a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1452/intel-announces-major-expansion-in-arizona"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, Intel announced that it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Chandler, Arizona, an expansion of its existing campus there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jso4S8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arizona has been “vital” to Intel’s operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsUtK"&gt;Last year, the company pledged that by 2030 it will restore and return more freshwater than it uses. It’s nearing that benchmark in Arizona, where Intel says it cleaned up and returned 95 percent of the freshwater it used in 2020. It has its own water treatment plant at its Ocotillo campus in Chandler that’s similar to a municipal plant. There’s also a “brine reduction facility,” a public-private partnership with the city of Chandler, that brings 2.5 million gallons of Intel’s wastewater a day back to drinking standard. Intel uses some of the treated water again, and the rest is sent to replenish groundwater sources or be used by surrounding communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrygKe"&gt;While Intel recycles much of its water, more fabs will mean it will need to send even more water through its systems. The company says that Arizona has been “&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-arizona.html"&gt;vital&lt;/a&gt;” to Intel’s operations for more than four decades. The state is already home to its first “mega-factory network” and its newest semiconductor fab. Intel used more than 5.2 billion gallons of water in Arizona in 2020 — roughly 20 percent of which was reclaimed water, according to its most recent &lt;a href="http://csrreportbuilder.intel.com/pdfbuilder/pdfs/CSR-2020-21-Full-Report.pdf"&gt;corporate responsibility report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFvtnn"&gt;“We continually look for opportunities to minimize our water footprint and will continue to make investments in water conservation and restoration, even as we continue to grow,” Intel said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ocMLY7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464280/skydio-2-x2-3d-scan-photogrammetry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcv16-lLsA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a water treatment plant for a new semiconductor facility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in Chandler, Arizona. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hY7ncH"&gt;Chip manufacturing giant TSMC also has its eye on Arizona. In May 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/2033"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to build a $12 billion new fab near Phoenix, which would be its first in Arizona and its second in the US (its first is in Washington state). TSMC could be planning to build up to six new fabs in Arizona over the next 10 to 15 years, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Opu9Pm"&gt;TSMC said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that for now it doesn’t expect the water shortage to have “any impact” on its plan to build a new fab in Arizona, although it says it will “continue to monitor the water supply situation closely.” &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTeLQW"&gt;Most of TSMC’s fabs are in Taiwan, where earlier this year the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/podcasts/story/2021-07-30/the-times-podcast-drought-taiwan-mexico-china"&gt;worst drought&lt;/a&gt; in more than 50 years &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chip-shortage-is-bad-taiwans-drought-threatens-to-make-it-worse-11618565400"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; the already stressed supply chain for chips. TSMC plans to finish construction this year of a new water treatment plant in Taiwan&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that could eventually recycle enough water to supply half of the company’s daily needs, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-tackles-Taiwan-drought-with-plant-to-reuse-water-for-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jS710Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The state is expected to face some tough choices in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWKEOv"&gt;While Taiwan still dominates semiconductor manufacturing, Arizona is emerging as a new hub. The Biden administration has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;prioritized&lt;/a&gt; building up a domestic supply of semiconductor chips as the current shortage affects everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;phones and game consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Two other companies, NXP and Microchip Inc., have fabs in the state also. NXP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;and Microchip declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbA24Q"&gt;Arizona is notoriously dry, which leaves it dependent on water-sharing agreements with other states. Arizona gets a hefty 38 percent of its water from the Colorado River, and with water from the river running low, the state is expected to face some tough choices in the future.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The state has been in a drought &lt;a href="https://new.azwater.gov/drought/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Arizona%20has%20been%20in,according%20to%20statewide%20precipitation%20patterns.&amp;amp;text=Unlike%20hurricanes%20and%20tornadoes%2C%20drought,and%20long%2Dterm%20drought%20conditions."&gt;since 1994&lt;/a&gt;, and climate change is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;making things worse&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the vast majority of Arizona faces a “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataTables.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 booster shots will be offered to Americans in September, Biden administration says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Covid-19 Moderna vaccination site on the grounds of the Brentwood Recreation Center" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5NmUgnFd4ewE1-qbXsy1GGsbFg=/176x0:5023x3231/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741626/1328876405.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Steve Pfost/Newsday RM via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAovEg"&gt;Everyone in the United States who got a COVID-19 vaccine will need a booster shot to keep protection from fading, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccinated Americans will be offered boosters eight months after their initial shots. Plans are that the first round will be offered in September and will go to nursing home residents, health care workers, and others vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzKxdh"&gt;“Current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout,” federal health officials said &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html"&gt;in a joint statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MrS1i"&gt;The current proposal only includes the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Officials say they’re expecting additional data to guide decision making around boosters for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpsIff"&gt;It’s a reversal from early July, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/08/1014438902/despite-new-covid-variants-cdc-says-you-dont-need-any-booster-doses-right-now"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that most people do not need booster shots. It’s also likely to be controversial from a global equity perspective — the majority of people in low-income countries haven’t received first doses yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjP0DL"&gt;The fast-spreading delta variant changed the equation. The administration is concerned that protection against the coronavirus could fade, either because of the passage of time or the variant, officials &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/16/booster-shot-coronavirus/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Preliminary data out of Israel, published as &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.21261317v1.full.pdf"&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; that have not undergone peer review and through &lt;a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/05072021-03"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Health, suggests the vaccine became less effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and symptomatic cases in the face of the country’s delta surge. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/vpb-12082021/he/files_publications_corona_vpb-12082021-01.pdf"&gt;Data released&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Health also suggested efficacy against severe cases of COVID-19 may be eroding for older adults. Israel is offering booster doses to people 60 years of age and older.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYAgcw"&gt;Data from the United States also shows vaccine effectiveness against coronavirus infections declining over time, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing. The shots are also less effective against infections from the delta variant, CDC data shows: effectiveness declined from 92 percent before the delta variant to 64 percent with the Delta variant in one US group, Walensky said. Protection against severe cases of COVID-19, hospitalization, and death remain high. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLfitGBRaDxRjkdopwUC84z70-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790147/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_11.33.24_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Data presented in a press briefing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0vOLEk"&gt;Still, there’s no data yet showing if the booster would offer additional protection against delta. A third dose generates &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-third-shot-booster-11623421703"&gt;higher levels of antibodies&lt;/a&gt; against the virus, but it’s not clear if or how much that would translate to additional protection against COVID-19. Pfizer has a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04955626?term=BNT162b2&amp;amp;draw=2&amp;amp;rank=8"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; testing that question underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMMyPN"&gt;Even if boosters can improve protection for fully vaccinated people, that wouldn’t do as much to blunt COVID-19 surges as would vaccinating more people in the US, Boston University epidemiologists Eleanor Murray and Ruby Barnard-Mayers &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/coronavirus-vaccine-booster-shots/2021/08/11/aefec5dc-fae0-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Only 62 percent of US adults are fully vaccinated. There are still no COVID-19 vaccines authorized for kids under 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3BKJM"&gt;Although the Biden administration announced the plan today, booster shots can’t roll out without clearance from the FDA and recommendation from the CDC. There are no booster shots currently authorized by the FDA, though once the agency fully approves the vaccines (which it’s expected to do by early September), physicians would have more flexibility to distribute additional doses. Pfizer submitted initial data on booster doses to the FDA this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i0h1R"&gt;The CDC recommended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623600/cdc-covid-third-vaccine-immunocompromised"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that people with compromised immune systems get third doses of either the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, as many don’t produce enough antibodies after the regular series. That third dose isn’t considered a booster — it’s an expanded initial vaccine regimen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rb1Pn"&gt;Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-calls-moratorium-covid-19-vaccine-booster-doses-until-september-end-2021-08-04/"&gt;called for a moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on COVID-19 vaccine boosters until the end of September so that more vaccine supply could make it to low-income countries. There are huge gaps in vaccine access between high and low-income countries — only around 1 percent of people in low-income countries have received even one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4bxie"&gt;“This is a global pandemic and we need to think about global solutions,” Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID-19 technical lead at the WHO, told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;. “All of the world’s most vulnerable, and those who are most at-risk — health workers — need to receive their first and second doses before a large proportion of the population or all of the population in some countries receive that third dose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVoVl5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ latest trailer shows off big changes for battles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legendary Pokemon Arceus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kxh_F08EeuFORJ2YLrmad8ULcSc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741591/Switch_PokemonLegendsArceus_Screenshot__17_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdG7YW"&gt;Nintendo announced a ton of new information for the hotly anticipated &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; during today’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kdja9m4YlT4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;Presents&lt;/a&gt; showcase. In addition to covering a new battle system, new regional pokémon, and the new skills trainers will need to catch ‘em all, Nintendo also released a brand-new, beautiful trailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7dZAX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legend: Arceus &lt;/em&gt;takes place in the Hisui region — a natural paradise filled with different ecosystems and stuffed all kinds of regional pokémon. Your goal is to help the Galaxy Expedition Team study and catalog the pokémon of the region by compiling the very first Pokédex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ze49yD"&gt;Nintendo offered a glimpse into &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;battle system, which combines classic pokémon gameplay with a couple of new twists. One new feature is the Action Order bar that displays which pokémon’s turn is next. You can influence turn order and frequency by using attacks that fall into either the strong style or the agile style category. Strong style moves hit harder but are slower and increase the amount of time between your next attack. Agile style moves are weaker but faster and using them will give you multiple opportunities to attack in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHPZge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; also showcased the different kinds of pokémon inhabiting the Hisui region. Like &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends&lt;/em&gt; will feature regional variants of pokémon who have specially adapted to life in the Hisui region. Some of these local variants, like the Hisuian braviary or the spirit possessed basculegion, will let you ride them to cross the vast and varied landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsGI9A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; is a bold new direction for the beloved monster-catching franchise. The game’s emphasis on freely roaming through swaying grass as little bidoofs jump about has already drawn comparisons to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. It seems that Nintendo wants to break the familiar format of previous &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games by giving players a gorgeous pokémon-stuffed world and the leisure to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czd6KW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus &lt;/em&gt;comes to the Nintendo Switch on January 28th, 2022.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile data breach exposed the personal info of more than 47 million people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="T-Mobile network advertises seen on a Jumbotron in Times..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SeY8vHs9AcZ2ShHiYHqB1aj5rMU=/0x30:4793x3225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741585/1229111902.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Lamparski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPCyBJ"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/additional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation"&gt;released more information&lt;/a&gt; about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/15/22626270/t-mobile-investigating-report-customer-data-breach'"&gt;most recent data breach&lt;/a&gt;, and while the company’s findings fall short of the reported 100 million records, the numbers are staggering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unYsU5"&gt;While saying its investigation is still ongoing, the company confirmed that records of over 40 million “former or prospective customers” who had previously applied for credit and 7.8 million postpaid customers (those who currently have a contract) were stolen. In its last earnings report (&lt;a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/400059132/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/NG_TMUS-06_30_2021-EX-99.1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), T-Mobile said it had over 104 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoGq9b"&gt;The data in the stolen files contained critical personal information included first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license / ID numbers — the kind of information you could use to set up an account in someone else’s name or hijack an existing one. It apparently did not include “phone numbers, account numbers, PINs or passwords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LMVzP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile found out about the breach based on a forum post&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="96Jzp9"&gt;That isn’t the end of it, either, as over 850,000 prepaid T-Mobile customers were also victims of the breach, and for them, the exposed data includes “names, phone numbers, and account PINs.” Affected customers have already had their PINs reset and will receive a notification “right away.” There was also unspecified information accessed for inactive prepaid accounts. However, T-Mobile says, “No customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information or SSN was in this inactive file.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUHUn2"&gt;The notice includes boilerplate language that “We take our customers’ protection very seriously,” but it rings especially hollow from T-Mobile considering that this is at least the fourth data breach exposed in the last few years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;one in January&lt;/a&gt;. According to the company’s statement, its investigation began based on a report of someone claiming in an online forum that they had compromised T-Mobile’s servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMaLXg"&gt;A Twitter account advertising stolen data for sale &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the attack affected all 100 million customers and included IMEI / IMSI data for 36 million customers that could uniquely identify specific devices or SIM cards, but T-Mobile’s announcement does not confirm that is the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyYN5X"&gt;T-Mobile says it will publish a dedicated website with information for customers later today. It’s offering two years of free identity protection services from McAfee, recommends postpaid customers change their PIN, and mentions its Account Takeover Protection capabilities to prevent SIM-swapping attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Galaxy Watch 4 review: welcome to Samsung’s garden</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s Google’s new smartwatch OS, but it’s Samsung’s watch&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ArU0wE"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic are the first watches in a very long time to be built on a platform that could provide Android users a credible smartwatch. I’ve been testing both for a week and they’re the best smartwatches I’ve ever used with a Samsung phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKmEv6"&gt;Although these watches are running Google’s new Wear OS 3 instead of Samsung Tizen OS, they are &lt;em&gt;Samsung&lt;/em&gt; watches. That means the interface, the apps, the NFC payment system, the health tracking, and the assistant all come from Samsung’s Galaxy ecosystem, not Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg85hU"&gt;After an eternity of waiting for Google, Fossil, Mobvoi, and the rest of the Wear OS ecosystem to get its act together with smartwatches, Samsung has swooped in and made something great. But only if you’re using a Samsung phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rIJVCO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10706590"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="KV0en9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10706592"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IUeT0W"&gt;Hardware and Wear OS 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MueaWG"&gt;Google announced this past May that it was partnering with Samsung to essentially merge Google’s own Wear OS platform with Samsung’s Tizen platform. Google has provided the base operating system, Samsung has provided much-improved hardware and a bunch of new watchface options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM01Yn"&gt;The practical benefit of this partnership is that the new Galaxy watches avoid the problems that beset &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Wear OS and Tizen. Unlike Wear OS watches of the past, the Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic actually feel fast and manage to last more than a full day without annoying battery saver modes. And unlike Tizen watches, you can actually use Google Maps and support from third-party apps is about to be reinvigorated with new versions of Strava, Spotify, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="puhPqC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10706598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lQmLy5"&gt;The watch hardware on both models is very much in line with Samsung’s earlier smartwatches, and that’s largely a great thing. They both have circular OLED watchfaces you can set to be always on. They’re not ridiculously large and have a decent fit and finish. They’re not quite as well-built as an Apple Watch, but they’re close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Da2Hk"&gt;They also start at a very reasonable $249.99 for the 40mm regular aluminum Galaxy Watch. The Watch 4 Classic with a rotating bezel and slightly chunkier, stainless steel build starts at $349.99 for a 42mm model. You can step up to larger sizes or put in LTE for more money on both watches. All sizes use standard 20mm straps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4zRaK"&gt;The core interface on these watches is a bit of Google’s Wear OS with a bit of Samsung’s Tizen-inspired One UI. You swipe up for apps, right for notifications, down for quick settings, and left for Tiles. Tiles are essentially little information widgets you can quickly swipe through and they’re one of my favorite recent additions to Wear OS, because it means there’s less pressure to laden the main watchface with a kajillion complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic has a rotating bezel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCUlKmOLsINI_H5kbQq8f2QSHT8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787995/dbohn_210816_4717_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic has a rotating bezel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The regular Galaxy Watch 4 has a touch-sensitive bezel, which is fiddly." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4Vc96wcN6ynBFQfkw4AXX8cQKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787999/dbohn_210816_4717_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Galaxy Watch 4 has a touch-sensitive bezel, which is fiddly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLAsNz"&gt;Samsung’s watches are known for having a rotating bezel which makes scrolling much faster. On the regular Galaxy Watch 4, it’s a touch-sensitive area around the screen and it’s fairly fiddly. I found myself giving up on it and just swiped on the screen most of the time. On the Watch 4 Classic, you get a physical bezel with a satisfying little click as you move through screens and lists. It’s great, and if you like the styling of the Classic, it might be worth the extra hundred bucks all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAwk4H"&gt;The default watchfaces are really good, too. There’s a good mix of fun (a bear that points to your notification indicator) and useful (complications that don’t overwhelm the screen but still give you a lot of information density). You can long-press to switch them. There are a ton of them built in, and they’re much nicer than what I’ve seen on most Wear OS watches in the past couple years. If you want, you can still install custom watchfaces from the Google Play Store or build your own with an app like Facer or Pujie Black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYhnWc"&gt;Each watch has two buttons. The top brings you home or can be double-clicked to quickly switch to the previously used app. The bottom brings up a view of recently used apps you can swipe through. Each button also has a different, hard-coded function when you long-press it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jtlutn"&gt;That’s when Samsung starts taking over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (top left) and Galaxy Watch 4 (bottom right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsSkFQ8_ozOZjNPwrd0E0fMaDEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788001/dbohn_210816_4717_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (top left) and Galaxy Watch 4 (bottom right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qpwu5O"&gt;Samsung ecosystem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="l8T6ha"&gt;Long-pressing the bottom button takes you to Samsung Pay. Long-pressing the top button takes you to Samsung’s Bixby digital assistant. So far as I can tell, these options cannot be changed and it’s unclear if Samsung will ever make Google Assistant available in place of Bixby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="qCKsrP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy Watch works with any Android phone, but really it’s meant for Samsung phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Most of the pre-installed apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 come from Samsung." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrznZlqdrp50UtpFcuoRBVtmXaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787996/dbohn_210816_4717_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the preinstalled apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 come from Samsung.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0P4Ymt"&gt;Functionally, Samsung Pay works fine. Bixby, not so much. It’s much better than its bottom of the barrel reputation, but it still can’t do basic things like set multiple alarms. It’s somewhat responsive, mostly, though sometimes it will inexplicably take two or three seconds to start listening. Bixby also is unaware that the watch now has Google Maps preinstalled: you can’t ask Bixby for directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZG2zX"&gt;The vast majority of default apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 are Samsung apps. From Calendar to Calculator, Contacts to Weather, it’s clearly Samsung’s system. It is integrated with Samsung’s system for auto-switching Galaxy Buds headphones, and it’s designed to automatically copy over certain settings from Samsung phones. Some of these apps can be replaced, but many cannot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glYmX4"&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use the Galaxy Watch 4 with any Android phone, but doing so requires installing multiple Samsung apps to get the full experience. It needs Samsung’s Wearable app to set up, a Samsung account to use Bixby, Samsung Pay to use payments, and Samsung Health for robust health tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfDgOd"&gt;In short, if you’re not using a Samsung phone, I don’t think this is a good watch for you. It also won’t work with iPhones, by the way, something both Google and Samsung have dabbled with in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 has a sensor for measuring body fat percentages" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDiVcplrsCFyP1eccFHu_JF93us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787997/dbohn_210816_4717_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 has a sensor for measuring body fat percentages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hnAYBQ"&gt;Samsung Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="g2Yqea"&gt;The biggest hardware upgrades on the Galaxy Watch 4 and 4 Classic — compared to previous Samsung watches — are related to health. Samsung has riddled the back of the watch with sensors. It can do the usual pulse and step counting, of course. It supports 95 different kinds of workout tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgk8Hv"&gt;It can do ECG for checking for atrial fibrillation and also blood oxygen detection, just like the Apple Watch. And just like the Apple Watch and other wearables with those features, you should not use those features as diagnostic tools. I frequently would get inaccurate readings that would have led me to worry about my heart and lung health had I not been aware that these sensors are unreliable. Outside the US, Samsung is offering a blood pressure feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H19zft"&gt;Samsung has also added a bioelectric impedance sensor, which is designed to measure body fat. It works in a way similar to existing consumer smart scales, sending an electrical signal through your body and measuring the impedance. Fat’s lower water content compared to muscle helps the watch get an estimate of your body fat percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SsV5Xb"&gt;It’s a better measure than BMI, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621600/samsung-galaxy-watch-body-fat-composition"&gt;Nicole Westman has explained&lt;/a&gt;, but again: as with any wearable, it’s not a diagnostic tool. But if you’re into quantified self stats and are aware of how to put any of these health numbers into a proper context, it could be useful to track trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pZo8as"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10706614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAHVsI"&gt;That brings us to the tool you’ll need to use to track those trends over time: Samsung Health. (Technically, ECG is measured by an app called Samsung Health Monitor, which keeps data locally on the watch unless you choose to transfer it over to your phone). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZTvd6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://samsunghealth.com/privacy"&gt;Samsung Health’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; is not very reassuring. It says that Samsung can obtain data like heart rate, body fat, glucose, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, information related to your menstrual cycle, sleep-related information, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOyhWY"&gt;I asked Samsung and a spokesperson assured me that all this information is end-to-end encrypted and that Samsung will only be able to access it if you choose to share it. But it’s a lot, and if you do accidentally opt in, Samsung could use it for anything from creating customized workouts for you to improving the app to marketing promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="nbIPkN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 has extensive health tracking features, but they work best with Samsung Health&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The biometric sensors on the back of the Galaxy Watch 4." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6E8XGu4cVdMgJu3ziM5eWuLoFVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788002/dbohn_210816_4717_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biometric sensors on the back of the Galaxy Watch 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WLDqNz"&gt;Apple does a better job explaining that it cannot access your health data. It doesn’t have the keys. I trust Samsung more than I trust a lot of other companies, but wow, it needs to do a much better job explaining its privacy and encryption policies. Samsung does offer a simple “Erase all personal data collected by Samsung” button in its settings, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wZtiT"&gt;As fitness and health tracking become more important — especially on wearables — we’re all going to need to do a better job understanding the tradeoffs. The temptation to treat them as medical devices is real, but they’re not ready for that. The temptation to just click “accept” on every privacy and data dialog that pops up is also real. And finally: the lock-in is real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVIfHz"&gt;It’s a messy mix of a desire for data portability, data privacy, and each company’s incentives to lock you into their system. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 is not unique in raising these issues, but they’re worth thinking about. Whether you’re using Samsung Health, Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, or something else, you may be unwittingly putting yourself in a position to want to stick with that platform because that’s where your data lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMzAxy"&gt;If you’re willing to give Samsung Health a go, though, its features and functionality are surprisingly robust. It has tracking for all sorts of different metrics. You can set the watch to track your sleep, including blood oxygen. You can choose to use the phone on your nightstand to listen for snoring to sync that up with your sleep data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DaI8gQ"&gt;In my testing, the Watch 4’s accuracy was fairly good. On several bike rides, it matched the readings from both the Apple Watch and a Garmin for heart rate. However, it was off by about 5 percent for measuring distance via GPS. You can then sync that data over to Strava, but it is lacking in other third-party app integrations compared to Apple Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic with a fun bear-themed watch face." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vaF47wrmRYVPFnWNEYyghgdLgs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787998/dbohn_210816_4717_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic with a fun bear-themed watchface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FK8hXq"&gt;I really enjoyed using the Galaxy Watch 4. It has been a genuine pleasure to have a competent and capable smartwatch paired to my Android phone — one that doesn’t have any show-stopping problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIcgbb"&gt;But the reason I had that nice experience was because I was using the Galaxy Watch 4 with a Samsung phone. If you’re a Samsung user, the Galaxy Watch 4 is an excellent smartwatch. If you’re not, the Galaxy Watch 4 all but forces you into Samsung’s ecosystem. Samsung’s ecosystem &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; better than it often gets credit for, but it’s limiting. Just as the Apple Watch keeps people on the iPhone, Samsung’s watch will keep people on Samsung phones (or at least get them to install Samsung software and use Samsung services on their Android phones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="T5xj7n"&gt;If you’d like to use a Wear OS 3 smartwatch that isn’t tied to Samsung, I wish I knew what to tell you. There are no Wear OS 3 smartwatches from other manufacturers on the horizon. After so many years of waiting for a good smartwatch for Android users, it’s finally here — but only for some of us. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Researchers produce collision in Apple’s child-abuse hashing system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tI3S8Iz7HFj9gBJrDYFCvUnyxc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741505/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r0Ff7C"&gt;Researchers have produced a collision in iOS’s built-in hash function, raising new concerns about the integrity of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s CSAM-scanning system&lt;/a&gt;. The flaw affects the hashing system, called NeuralHash, which allows Apple to check for exact matches of known child-abuse imagery without possessing any of the images or gleaning any information about non-matching pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiRbf8"&gt;On Tuesday, a GitHub user called Asuhariet Ygvar &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX"&gt;posted code for&lt;/a&gt; a reconstructed Python version of NeuralHash, which he claimed to have reverse-engineered from previous versions of iOS. The GitHub post also includes &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/blob/master/README.md"&gt;instructions on how to extract the NeuralMatch files from a current macOS or iOS build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll8Eho"&gt;“Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations,” Ygvar wrote on Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/p6hsoh/p_appleneuralhash2onnx_reverseengineered_apple/"&gt;sharing the new code&lt;/a&gt;. “Hope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before it’s enabled on all iOS devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ivT4by"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Researchers produced a collision: two images that generate the same hash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnJOzI"&gt;Once the code was public, more significant attacks were quickly discovered. A user called Cory Cornelius &lt;a href="https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/issues/1"&gt;produced a collision in the algorithm&lt;/a&gt;: two images that generate the same hash. If the findings hold up, it will be a significant failure in the cryptography underlying Apple’s new system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEJxAu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;On August 5th&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new system for stopping child-abuse imagery on iOS devices. Under the new system, iOS will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;check locally stored files&lt;/a&gt; against hashes of child abuse imagery, as generated and maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). The system contains numerous privacy safeguards, limiting scans to iCloud photos and setting a threshold of as many as 30 matches found before an alert is generated. Still, privacy advocates remain concerned about the implications of scanning local storage for illegal material, and the new finding has heightened concerns about how the system could be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGnChB"&gt;While the collision is significant, it would require extraordinary efforts to exploit it in practice. Generally, collision attacks allow researchers to find identical inputs that produce the same hash. In Apple’s system, this would mean generating an image that sets off the CSAM alerts even though it is not a CSAM image, since it produces the same hash as an image in the database. But actually generating that alert would require access to the NCMEC hash database, generating more than 30 colliding images, and then smuggling all of them onto the target’s phone. Even then, it would only generate an alert to Apple and NCMEC, which would easily identify the images as false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2R87I"&gt;Still, it’s an embarrassing flaw that will only elevate criticism of the new reporting system. A proof-of-concept collision is often disastrous for crytographic hashes, as in the case of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14712118/google-sha1-collision-broken-web-encryption-shattered"&gt;the SHA-1 collision in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, although perceptual hashes like NeuralHash are known to be more collision-prone. As a result, it’s unclear whether Apple will replace the algorithm in response to the finding, or make more measured changes to mitigate potential attacks. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XNcpf"&gt;More broadly, the finding will likely heighten calls for Apple to abandon its plans for on-device scans, which have continued to escalate in the weeks following the announcement. On Tuesday, the Electronic Frontier Foundation &lt;a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-apple-don-t-scan-our-phones"&gt;launched a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on Apple to drop the system, under the title “Tell Apple: Don’t Scan Our Phones.” As of press time, it has garnered more than 1,700 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSftcK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 10:53AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and copy to more accurately reflect known weaknesses of perceptual hash systems in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Tesla’s AI day event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vOGwioe_5DW3pyEEYXbVLMp60QA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741380/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Recruitment, robots, and really powerful supercomputers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2ifpv6"&gt;It’s been nearly two years since Tesla’s first “Autonomy Day” event, at which CEO Elon Musk made numerous lofty predictions about the future of autonomous vehicles, including his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions"&gt;infamous claim&lt;/a&gt; that the company would have “one million robotaxis on the road” by the end of 2020. And now it’s time for &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux"&gt;Part Deux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7SMHR"&gt;This time, the event will be called “AI Day,” and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1420607874762518528"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;, the “sole goal” is to persuade experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla. The company is known for its high rate of turnover, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/musk-lieutenant-guillen-leaves-tesla-as-chief-of-heavy-trucking?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;the latest being Jerome Guillen&lt;/a&gt;, a key executive who worked at Tesla for 10 years before recently stepping down. Attracting and retaining talent, especially top tier names, has proven to be a challenge for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ic6waS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The August 19th event is scheduled to start at 5PM PT / 8PM ET&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHNRmc"&gt;The August 19th event is scheduled to start at 5PM PT / 8PM ET at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California. According to an invitation &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/04/tesla-teases-future-products-using-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it will feature “a keynote by Elon, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in Model S Plaid, and more.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Much like Battery Day&lt;/a&gt;, the event will be livestreamed on Tesla’s website, giving investors and the media, as well as the company’s many fans, an up-close look at what’s under development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc7usm"&gt;Musk and other top officials at the company are expected to provide updates on the rollout of Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta version 9, which started reaching more customers this summer. We may also get details about Tesla’s “Dojo” supercomputer, the training of its neural network, and the production of its FSD computer chips. And there will also be “an inside look at what’s next for AI at Tesla beyond our vehicle fleet,” the invitation says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vW4HWQ"&gt;Let’s start with what we know and work our way toward the speculation of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VC5QUA"&gt;FSD rollout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cVDbfM"&gt;The big news out of Tesla’s first Autonomy Day was the introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18511594/tesla-new-self-driving-chip-is-here-and-this-is-your-best-look-yet"&gt;the company’s first computer chip&lt;/a&gt;, a 260 square millimeter piece of silicon that Musk described as “the best chip in the world.” Originally, Musk had claimed that Tesla’s cars wouldn’t need any hardware updates, only software, on the road to full autonomy. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685873/tesla-fsd-chip-upgrade-2019-install-hw2-full-self-driving"&gt;Turns out that wasn’t exactly the case&lt;/a&gt;; they would need this new chip — two of them, actually — in order to eventually drive themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d80z9A"&gt;A lot has happened between the 2019 event and now. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570081/tesla-fsd-v9-beta-autopilot-update"&gt;Tesla began shipping over-the-air software updates for FSD beta v9&lt;/a&gt;, its long-awaited, definitely not autonomous, but certainly advanced driver assist system. That means that Tesla owners who have purchased the FSD option (which now costs $10,000) would finally be able to use many of Autopilot’s advanced driver-assist features on local, non-highway streets, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18065540/tesla-navigate-on-autopilot-model-3-test-drive"&gt;Navigate on Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, Auto Lane Change, AutoPark, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/30/20891343/tesla-smart-summon-feature-videos-parking-accidents"&gt;Summon&lt;/a&gt;, and Traffic Light and Stop Control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zIdPyc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update doesn’t make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BsrciC"&gt;The update doesn’t make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous, nor will it launch “a million self-driving cars” on the road, as Musk predicted. Tesla owners who have Full Self-Driving still need to pay attention to the road and keep their hands on the steering wheel. Some don’t, which can have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;tragic consequences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6csG1l"&gt;Loved by fans, loathed by safety advocates, the FSD software has gotten Tesla in a lot of hot water recently. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;In recently publicized emails&lt;/a&gt; between Tesla and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, the company’s director of Autopilot software made it clear that Musk’s comments (including his tweets) do not reflect the reality of what Tesla’s vehicles can actually do. And now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;Autopilot is under investigation by federal regulators&lt;/a&gt; who want to know why Teslas with Autopilot keep crashing into emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpLvIs"&gt;Aside from the rollout of FSD beta v9, Tesla has also had to adjust to the global chip shortage. In a recent earnings call, Musk said that the company’s engineers had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite some of their software&lt;/a&gt; in order to accommodate alternate computer chips. He also said that Tesla’s future growth will depend on a swift resolution to the global semiconductor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2EZhe"&gt;Tesla relies on chips to power everything from its airbags to the modules that control the vehicles’ seatbelts. It’s not clear whether the FSD chips, which are produced by Samsung, are being impacted by the shortage. Musk and his cohort may provide some insight into that during this week’s event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JWm85o8-JY-dJMrM0QpMjdh9jRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16183257/Tesla_Full_Self_Driving_Computer_2040.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Credit: Tesla&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jP2vgN"&gt;Dojo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yfq7Ok"&gt;Outside the car, Tesla uses a powerful supercomputer to train the AI software that then gets fed to its customers via over-the-air software updates. In 2019, Musk teased this “super powerful training computer,” which he referred to as “Dojo.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1hqtM"&gt;“Tesla is developing a [neural net] training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1294371531133317120?s=20"&gt;he later tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a beast!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ocJK9"&gt;He also hinted at Dojo’s computing power, claiming it was capable of an exaFLOP, or one quintillion (​​1018) floating-point operations per second. That is an incredible amount of power. “To match what a one exaFLOP computer system can do in just one second,” &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3535080/thousands-of-home-pcs-break-exaflop-barrier.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NetworkWorld&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; last year, “you’d have to perform one calculation every second for 31,688,765,000 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="07Ee3N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a beast!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lARL1H"&gt;By way of comparison, chipmaker AMD and computer builder Cray are currently working with the US Department of Energy on the design of the world’s fastest supercomputer, with 1.5 exaFLOPs of processing power. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535078/worlds-fastest-exascale-supercomputer-frontier-amd-cray-doe-oak-ridge-national-laboratory"&gt;Dubbed Frontier&lt;/a&gt;, AMD says the supercomputer will have as much processing power as the next 160 fastest supercomputers combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpODUy"&gt;When completed, Dojo is expected to be among the most powerful supercomputers on the planet. But rather than performing advanced calculations in areas like nuclear and climate research, Tesla’s supercomputer is running a neural net for the purposes of training its AI software to power self-driving cars. Ultimately, Musk has said Tesla will make Dojo available to other companies that want to use it to train their neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec2e9Y"&gt;Earlier this year, Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s head of AI, gave a presentation at the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, during which he offered more details about Dojo and its neural network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gucMW2"&gt;“For us, computer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and what enables Autopilot,” Karpathy said, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/21/tesla-unveils-new-supercomputer-train-self-driving-ai/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And for that to work really well, we need to master the data from the fleet, and train massive neural nets and experiment a lot. So we invested a lot into the compute.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="l99jH4"&gt;But Hong is an interesting figure for other reasons, too. &lt;a href="https://www.romela.org/dr-dennis-hong/"&gt;He specializes in humanoid robots&lt;/a&gt; and was a participant in the DARPA Urban Challenge which kicked off the race for self-driving cars. (His team placed third.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImW2qi"&gt;Asked on Twitter whether his lab was working with Tesla, Hong posted some playful emojis but otherwise declined comment. We may learn more about how Hong’s work and Tesla’s pursuits intersect during AI Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikRsx"&gt;Musk has been forthcoming about his desires for Tesla to become more than just a car company. “I think long term, people will think of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company,” he said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bHB2BM"&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xHCy3M"&gt;A warning for anyone tuning in to the AI Day livestream: take Musk’s predictions about near-term accomplishments with a massive grain of salt. The things that will be discussed during this event are unlikely to have any measurable impact on the company’s business in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyEDBr"&gt;Self-driving cars are an incredibly difficult challenge. Even companies like Waymo that are perceived to have the best autonomous vehicle technology &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;are still struggling to get it right&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla is no different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMyvv0"&gt;“A key question for investors will be what the latest timeline is for achieving full autonomy,” Loup Funds managing partner Gene Munster &lt;a href="https://loupfunds.com/tesla-ai-day-to-give-glimpse-into-autonomy-other-applications/"&gt;said in a note&lt;/a&gt;. “Despite Elon’s ambitious goal of the end of this year, our best guess is that 2025 will be the first year of public availability of level 4 autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oWkfg3"&gt;The rest of 2021 is already jam packed for Tesla. The company needs to open factories in Texas and Germany. And it needs to tool up production for its hotly anticipated Cybertruck, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;which has been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Full autonomy, such as it is, can wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYSujL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Lkug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZU538"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, the five-versus-five MOBA game that released in July for the Nintendo Switch, will debut on iOS and Android devices on September 22nd. The Pokémon Company shared today during a livestream that you can pre-register for the mobile game now on your respective devices (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1512321575"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;). You’ll be notified when it’s officially available to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJqIX3"&gt;Whether you play &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; on mobile or a Nintendo Switch, the game will offer cross-platform play to broaden who you can play alongside or against. By linking your account on both the Switch version and the mobile game, you’ll be able to have cross-progression, which will allow you to play the game with your saved data and characters on whichever device is more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ special edition Zephyrus G14 comes with its own DJ deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition keyboard seen from above angled to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9K39qB4ndmZNzeimFKfeddqhow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741204/bfarsace_210817_4714_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you spot the Alan Walker logo?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2faU2"&gt;If there’s one company I trust to do a good job with utterly ridiculous computer ideas, it’s Asus. Last fall, the company worked with cyberpunky fashion designer Acronym to make possibly the weirdest-looking gaming laptop I’ve ever seen (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21432977/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-acronym-amd-ryzen-9-4900hs-nvidia-rtx-2060"&gt;ZPHYRS G14 ACRNM&lt;/a&gt;). This year, it’s partnered with popular DJ Alan Walker to create a less avant-garde, more musical version of the same device. This is the Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition, a laptop for gamers, DJs, and (ideally) gamer DJs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIVvhZ"&gt;The insides of this laptop are nothing ROG fans haven’t seen before. There’s only one configuration, selling for $1,999.99, which includes an AMD Ryzen 5900HS processor and a low-end GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, as well as a QHD 120Hz screen, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. So, just to be clear, this isn’t really a sensible purchase unless you’re an Alan Walker superfan, because &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM300000011/A50184-ROG-Zephyrus-G14-AniMe-Matrix-Ultra-Slim-Gaming-Laptop%2C-14%E2%80%9D-120Hz-PANTONE-Validated-QHD-Display%2C-GeForce-RTX-3060%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-32GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-Windows-10-Pro%2C-GA401QM-XS98Q-WH"&gt;that same price&lt;/a&gt; can get you a non-Walker G14 with a more powerful RTX 3060 GPU, as well as 32GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch seen from the front, open. The screen displays Alan Walker hovering on a red and blue background, conjuring lights of each color with his hands. To its left is its box, with 11 DJ buttons and ROG X ALAN WALKER printed on the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3_PYRkWK0ugBoz-mngQOTxcW0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788137/bfarsace_210817_4714_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, those buttons actually work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dx3nzO"&gt;Still, it’s a pretty cool device. The lid is laced with a reflective belt commanding passersby to “JOIN THE REPUBLIC” and “JOIN THE WALKERS.” Alan Walker’s logo — resembling an A superimposed over a W — is printed in various places, including the A and W keys as well as on the nameplate. There’s a diagonal line print on the touchpad meant to resemble music equalizer patterns, and there are splashes of bright blue — Walker’s favorite color — across the keyboard as well. It’s not an obnoxious aesthetic, like these special editions sometimes have — it looks more like a standard G14 with some colorful tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlXfGf"&gt;Walker says the design reflects the look he’d want his personal device to have. “They approached me and asked, what are your expectations for the laptop, what do you look for in a laptop if you were to pick one yourself?” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview. “It was a lot of back and forth — like, a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch, facing away from the camera, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iW5dnLAmRyPm_0JkAphCBV-FWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788134/bfarsace_210817_4714_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOIN THE REPUBLIC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition on a couch seen from the front, open. The screen displays Alan Walker hovering on a red and blue background, conjuring lights of each color with his hands." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pybxRhdumQhEIof99XaMe6oL09A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788138/bfarsace_210817_4714_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOIN THE WALKERS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJjKIG"&gt;The other cool thing is that the packaging this G14 comes in becomes a DJ deck when connected to the laptop via USB-C. It’s not the most high-tech affair — if you lift up the paper floor, you’ll see a nest of wires taped to the bottom of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6FmJn"&gt;“That’s one of those crazy ideas where we ended up debating, would this be possible?” Walker said of the DJ box. “Asus is like ‘Yeah, cool, we can maybe think about something, figure something out,’ and then they came back with a box.” He added, “It’s so weird how it even works.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUYwYy"&gt;I expected this to be complicated to set up for a non-DJ like myself, but it was a breeze. Plug the box into the G14, and a preloaded software called ROG Remix opens automatically. You can play a song within that program, and then tweak it by pressing various buttons on the box. There are buttons for things like speed, start / stop, and a few basic effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left palm rest of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OSZEWOkdWXPjCDZDmClvmddk7hE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788135/bfarsace_210817_4714_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same old chips, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DacaWjLE2f5r-JK31Tiw0YSKMCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788136/bfarsace_210817_4714_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same old ports as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GUvJmF"&gt;This was — caveating, again, that I’m not a DJ — a lot of fun. The buttons all worked, and the effects sounded very cool to my untrained ears. It seems like something you could easily use at a party, especially since the G14’s speakers are fantastic. The music was crackling a bit at the beginning, but that seemed to sort itself out after a few tracks. Mostly, I’m impressed that this is all coming out of a plastic box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie7b9y"&gt;Walker agrees that his G14 is a better purchase for people like me than it would be for actual DJs. “It’s not necessarily the number-one gadget to get if you want to start with DJing, but it’s definitely a cool starting point,” says Walker. “I hope that people will use it to be creative and play around with music.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pljb8X"&gt;He does, however, expect that he’ll use the G14 on his next tour. “It’s got everything that I need, basically, to work and prepare for my shows,” Walker says. “I can easily foresee myself using it every day.” He says he might use it to plan his set lists prior to performances, and to work on the visuals as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hqpo"&gt;He might also use it for some gaming in his spare time. “Lately I’ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “Also some &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBtDDC"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition is available now for $1,999.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
