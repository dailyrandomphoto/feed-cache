    <title>Epic is shutting down Houseparty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_0RSALuSs1QxGcL3hBUQlaII7o=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836102/stream_fortnite_gameplay_to_houseparty_1280x720_224cb65f8d7c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Houseparty’s &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt; mode.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SfgGKy"&gt;Epic Games is going to shut down group video chat app Houseparty, the company announced Thursday. The Houseparty app will be removed from app stores “immediately,” according to Epic, though people who already have the app will be able to use it until the service is fully shut down in October. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368345/epic-fortnite-houseparty-gameplay-streaming-app-video-chat-integration"&gt;Houseparty’s integration with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will also continue to work until Houseparty is shut down in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkzNkK"&gt;Houseparty, which was released by the creators of the popular Meerkat livestreaming app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/28/13081014/meerkat-houseparty-video-app"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, was purchased by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18662708/epic-games-houseparty-acquisition-fortnite-video-chat"&gt;Epic in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic says that “tens of millions of people” have used the app. Going forward, however, “the team behind Houseparty is working on creating new ways to have meaningful and authentic social interactions at metaverse scale across the Epic Games family,” Epic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnVvCr"&gt;That seems to indicate that Epic has more social features in the works for games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; that the Houseparty team will be contributing to, which could be important tools to keep gamers playing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22653797/fortnite-season-7-finale-live-event-date-operation-sky-fire"&gt;ever&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616779/rocket-league-season-4-cowboy-theme-tournament-updates-psyonix"&gt;updating&lt;/a&gt; games. But for those who used Houseparty to chat with their friends and family, the impending shutdown means they’ll have to move those conversations to another messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mad Max: Fury Road’s iconic fleet of post-apocalyptic War Rigs are up for auction</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mad Max Fury Road" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jj7OODwtdN_MC_szO7I8m-O8TyE=/1x0:1599x1065/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69836032/FRD-DS-00253.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q7adPC"&gt;Over a dozen vehicles from the 2015 cult classic &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road &lt;/em&gt;are being put up for a virtual auction. The vehicles will be available for bidding in a series of auctions held by &lt;a href="https://www.lloydsonline.com.au/AuctionDetails.aspx?aid=25652"&gt;Lloyds&lt;/a&gt; on September 25th-26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgXR1o"&gt;Reading through the descriptions of each vehicle — and hats off to the auctioneers, they really did a commendable job describing each lot — really made me want to fire up George Miller’s blood-and-sand-drenched movie for another watch. WITNESS ME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ncY8ge"&gt;Blown, super-turbo charged and armed to the teeth with weaponry and War Boys, the machines that outran the end of civilisation have been unearthed in the greatest barn-find ever recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQwYk1"&gt;Nitrous, noxious, and no-nonsense harbingers of hell, marking man’s uncanny ability to wring beauty even from that designed for death and destruction, art from power, meaning from machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gZlZsf"&gt;Imagine going for a grocery run in the War Rig that was driven by Tom Hardy’s Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa. Or picking up your kids from school in the Nux Wagon, the super-turbocharged, nitrous-boosted Deuce Coupe driven by Nicholas Hoult’s chrome-lipped true believer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GS0M4P"&gt;Personally, I may put in a bid for the Doof Wagon, the speaker-staked “morale machine” of Immortan Joe’s army of War Boys, intended to rally the troops and keep them pumped up for battle. As the film’s production designer said, “Every army needs a Little Drummer Boy.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Joe’s army had the Doof Warrior, a blind, bungee-attached psychopath who wielded a fire-breathing guitar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJOS4Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtjGTrVwRr4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PG0EjT"&gt;(Unrelated to the auction, I was today years old when I learned that the Doof Warrior’s mask was made from the dried skin of his murdered mother’s screaming face, and now I probably won’t sleep for a week.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7doHI4"&gt;If you live in Australia and need to inspect any of the vehicles before putting in a bid, an appointment can be made through Lloyds. The auction will also be livestreamed, so tune in if you want to see who gets what. No base prices have been set as of the publication of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYrbwS"&gt;Here’s a full list of the available vehicles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="X6DtSz"&gt;The War Rig: Prime Mover Inc. tanker and ball pig-trailer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K9y56y"&gt;The Gigahorse: W16 Cadillac pair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GivGnb"&gt;The Doof Wagon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PEDlTZ"&gt;Nux Car: 1932 three-window Chev Coupe, V8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pn33ly"&gt;Convoy Car: Elvis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RADEAR"&gt;Convoy Car: Jag Flamer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YU94Su"&gt;Razor Cola: 1973 XB Falcon Coupe (The Interceptor reborn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SivxGg"&gt;Pole Car: Pontiac Surfari with 20’ pole counterweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="95RBGT"&gt;Sabre Tooth: F250 Claw Car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oaIaLA"&gt;Fire Car: Dodge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8R8TLx"&gt;Caltrop: El Dorado&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AE0UDs"&gt;Buggy: Ratrod Chev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LbJkZN"&gt;Buick: heavy artillery with Hummer weapon mount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Amazon, fighting SpaceX’s Starlink plans, says Elon Musk’s companies don’t care about rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blue Origin Founder Jeff Bezos Makes Announcement At Satellite 2019 Conference In DC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GtrGZ3Aj1L7iYscg86KAHmATWSc=/0x0:3249x2166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835766/1148068855.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mark Wilson / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2h7ABW"&gt;Amazon slammed Elon Musk’s SpaceX as a serial rule-breaker on Wednesday amid an enduring fight over the two companies’ plans to build rivaling satellite networks. The conflict, waged within lengthy filings to the Federal Communications Commission, is nothing new. But this time, Amazon sent FCC officials a laundry list of Musk’s past troubles with other regulators, mounting its most aggressive attempt yet to push back on SpaceX’s speedy timeline for deploying its broadband satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDxMiI"&gt;“Try to hold a Musk-led company to flight rules? You’re ‘fundamentally broken,’” Amazon wrote in its filing, referring to the time Musk complained that the Federal Aviation Administration’s regulatory structure slowed down SpaceX’s operations. “Try to hold a Musk-led company to health and safety rules? You’re ‘unelected &amp;amp; ignorant,’” it added, referring to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259159878427267072?s=20"&gt;Musk’s beef with officials&lt;/a&gt; who sought to keep factories closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7bTaK"&gt;This particular fight — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;there have been many&lt;/a&gt; — goes back to earlier this year when SpaceX proposed an update to its Starlink network, a vast constellation of satellites in low-Earth orbit designed to beam broadband internet to rural areas with little to no internet connections. SpaceX has over 1,700 satellites in orbit so far, with about 100,000 customers using its internet services in a beta phase. Amazon is planning a similar satellite network called Kuiper with more than 3,000 satellites, but it hasn’t revealed production plans or launched any satellites to space yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from pad 40 at the Cape..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJbNMcaLnb4SdxcbGyIdv3JjJBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22648855/1233127360.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX launches its most recent dedicated Starlink mission on May 26th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Upl5re"&gt;Last month, SpaceX filed a request to tweak its proposal to the FCC, asking the commission to approve two plans for deploying Starlink satellites in the future. SpaceX, its filing said, would only implement one of the two plans, mainly hinging its decision on how quickly its next generation of Starlink satellites will be ready for launch and when its Starship rocket would be ready to start launching those Starlink satellites. Since 2019, SpaceX has used its Falcon 9 rockets to launch dozens of dedicated Starlink satellite missions to space. But Starship, a much bigger rocket that’s still under development, would more quickly send satellites in their target orbit, SpaceX says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dovg4N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon: reviewing SpaceX’s plans would “require significant effort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2UdotA"&gt;Amazon called foul days later, saying SpaceX’s strategy to propose two mutually exclusive plans runs afoul of precedent and “requires significant effort” for the FCC and other companies to scrutinize. SpaceX wasn’t buying it. “Amazon strains credulity by suggesting it lacks the resources to analyze SpaceX’s application, especially considering Amazon routinely brings as many as six lobbyists and lawyers to its many meetings with the Commission about SpaceX,” SpaceX shot back in another filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6X2f8"&gt;Amazon, in its latest filing, acknowledged it’s “well positioned” to evaluate the proposals but added that “this burden may weigh more heavily” on the other companies that commented on SpaceX’s plan. Companies are allotted time to analyze and oppose other companies’ proposed plans in case there’s a chance it interferes with their operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5mLTI"&gt;SpaceX’s rapid development pace of new technologies — supercharged by funding from Musk and lofty investment rounds — often moves faster than government agencies are able to regulate them, creating all sorts of trouble and drama and, sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;direct violations&lt;/a&gt;. Proposing two tentative plans for the FCC to review, while unconventional, is a bid to get the FCC on board with SpaceX’s speedy development ethic, which is defined by the company’s heavily boasted “iterative approach”: deploy the things first, get them in orbit, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; plan gradual updates — or iterations — to weed out inefficiencies in the next satellites’ design. SpaceX started launching the first iteration of some 30,000 planned Starlink satellites in 2019 and has over 1,700 currently in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKb3R8"&gt;Now, SpaceX wants to deploy an upgraded generation of satellites, built bigger and with added capabilities like laser links, which waive the need for ground stations by allowing the satellites to talk to each other and relay communications in orbit as they pass over user areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="62JKVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starlink’s sales boss: iteration is “what keeps people engaged”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eFwFSv"&gt;This production strategy is somewhat akin to SpaceX’s development with Starship: launch the thing first, work out any errors or design inefficiencies that pop up along the way, make design changes, launch again, rinse and repeat. In SpaceX’s rocket world, the iterative approach &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256657/spacex-launch-violation-explosive-starship-faa-investigation-elon-musk"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22352366/elon-musk-spacex-faa-warnings-starship-sn8-launch-violation-texas"&gt;pissed off regulators&lt;/a&gt;. And in the satellite world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;it’s pissing off SpaceX’s competitors&lt;/a&gt;. SpaceX has largely moved ahead regardless of those obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zHV82"&gt;“On the iteration side of things, that’s what keep people engaged,” Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX’s vice president of commercial Starlink sales, said on Wednesday. “With Starlink we’re certainly capitalizing on it, and we challenge everybody else to capitalize on it,” he said, adding that “the conventional way of doing satellites just takes too long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZOm7p"&gt;“People come to SpaceX… because they see action,” Hofeller said. “That’s how you get people engaged in what you’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the largest direct air capture plant will suck C02 out of the atmosphere  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s Largest Carbon-Sucking Plant Starts Making Tiny Dent in Emissions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rz3W2DhLqGn9t1J9BDe-4FpH8s8=/0x85:4000x2752/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835577/1235138610.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The ‘Orca’ direct air capture and storage facility, operated by Climeworks AG, in Hellisheidi, Iceland, on Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Arnaldur Halldorsson/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RPftzT"&gt;The biggest industrial plant yet to suck tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide out of the air came online yesterday in southwest Iceland. &lt;a href="https://atmos.earth/carbon-capture-removal-environmental-justice/"&gt;Direct air capture&lt;/a&gt; plants like this one have been hyped up lately by world leaders and giant corporations — notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; — that are looking to erase their legacy of greenhouse gas pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhH129"&gt;This particular operation is ideally located to test the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;emerging technology. The new plant, built by Swiss company Climeworks, is powered by renewable energy from a geothermal power plant nearby. Climeworks also plans to lock the captured CO2 away in basalt rock formations just three kilometers from the geothermal plant. It’s a storage plan that likely bypasses the need for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;controversial new carbon dioxide pipelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgaH6A"&gt;“It’s going to be, I think, an interesting test case,” says David Morrow, director of research at the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University. “But it’s also sort of a baby step in the big scheme of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6mv1ko"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A baby step in the big scheme of things”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgsD0d"&gt;Climeworks’ new direct air capture plant, called Orca for the Icelandic word for energy, will be able to draw down 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. That’s about how much 790 passenger vehicles might pump out in a year — not a huge amount, even though it’s the largest operation of its kind in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wAsHm"&gt;The new plant is surprisingly compact. Imagine a shipping container that’s open on one side to reveal twelve giant fans. The plant is basically just eight of those containers, stacked two by two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aX8HlD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nLBGM0kZmE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41sQYX"&gt;Climeworks uses a method&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;called solid direct air capture to trap CO2. Here’s how it works: The fans suck in air. The air passes over a special solid sorbent filter that traps the carbon dioxide. Climeworks wouldn’t get into too much detail about how its filters work in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, other than saying that it uses a base to attract CO2, which is mildly acidic. When the filter is fully saturated, it’s time for step two in the process. The unit heats up the filter to about 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), which releases the trapped carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUJKxA"&gt;Once the CO2 has been separated out of the air, it heads through pipes to an adjacent building where it can be prepped to be permanently stored. Here, it’s mixed with a lot of water — about 27 tons of water for every ton of carbon dioxide. That slurry then travels just a few hundred meters (about a quarter of a mile) away before it is injected deep into the ground. The carbonated water reacts with basaltic rock, creating carbonate minerals. Over the course of two years, what was once a kind of sparkling water becomes solid rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEv5wr"&gt;Climeworks has partnered with the company Carbfix to keep the captured CO2 safely locked away in Iceland’s basalt rock formations. The two companies have already tried this out in a pilot project, but Orca is the pair’s first commercial-scale operation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CR51JBmS02tQpWIo0r9NPJKc6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836822/ada4e9dd_a5e0_40c6_8ecd_038ac83e17f3_Orca_Launch_Website_Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Climeworks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Climeworks’ Orca direct air capture plant in Hellisheidi, Iceland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ArL8A"&gt;Climeworks’ two other commercial-scale direct air capture plants turn the carbon dioxide into a product used as fertilizer or in fizzy drinks. That CO2 escapes back into the atmosphere relatively quickly. But trapped in rock, Carbfix thinks the CO2 captured by Orca can be safely sequestered for thousands of years. While basaltic rock is relatively common around the world, volcanically active&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Iceland is particularly suited for storing carbon dioxide because it has relatively younger basalt. Fresh basalt is a better home for the captured CO2 because it’s more porous — giving the carbon more nooks and crannies to fill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wNSbL"&gt;By siting Orca in the same remote location where the CO2 will be stored, the operation avoids one of the potential pitfalls with carbon removal: creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;a new network of pipelines&lt;/a&gt; to transport captured carbon dioxide. There are already some pipelines that move CO2 so that it can be shot into the ground to force out oil reserves, a process called enhanced oil recovery. One such &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642806/co2-pipeline-explosion-satartia-mississippi-carbon-capture"&gt;pipeline ruptured&lt;/a&gt; last year in Mississippi, hospitalizing residents of a small, majority-Black community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8csOd"&gt;The other advantage of the plant’s location is its proximity to a geothermal energy plant, which provides the plant with a constant supply of waste heat and renewable energy. That, paired with Climeworks’ solid direct air capture process, gives Orca an edge over other competitors. Even larger direct air capture plants are scheduled to come online in Texas and Scotland in coming years, but those use a different filtration process that requires vastly more heat and energy. As a result, they’ll likely rely on a combination of renewable energy and natural gas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s1jEL"&gt;“If you’re in the business of removing CO2 from the air, you want to emit as little fossil fuel CO2 as possible. Otherwise, the process is not net negative or net removing,” says Christoph Beuttler, Climeworks’ head of climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J5MXoV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cost is another hurdle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eoy4Wf"&gt;Cost is another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/19/9174589/climate-change-carbon-removal-capture-air"&gt;hurdle&lt;/a&gt; still keeping the direct air capture industry from growing large enough to make a huge dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. Microsoft, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; last year to capture all of its historical emissions by 2050, is both an investor and a customer of Climeworks. Microsoft and other companies can purchase captured CO2 from Climeworks for around $600 a ton, offsetting a ton of their own pollution in the process. In its 2020 fiscal year alone, Microsoft was responsible for the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;11,164,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of carbon dioxide. Multiply that by $600, and Microsoft would face a bill of nearly $6.7 billion for just one year’s worth of pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xklAYy"&gt;Unless the price can come down significantly, it might not make much financial sense to tackle climate change this way. And some environmentalists worry that focusing on building up this technology could take resources away from other climate solutions, while taking the pressure off companies to quit burning fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0b1cX9"&gt;“One thing people worry about is that all these companies making that net-zero pledges will just use direct air capture instead of cutting emissions,” Morrow says. “But it strikes me as very unlikely that direct air capture would get cheap enough anytime soon for that to make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZXSRe"&gt;So while direct air capture might play a small role in helping the world trap some planet-heating emissions, it’s no replacement for deep cuts to fossil fuel pollution in the first place. “It is at most a supplement that can help us reduce climate change,” Morrow says. “But it can’t take the place of cutting emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8y5kTP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzrjaZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5RKur"&gt;YouTube is cutting the number of subscribers you need to be able to make Community posts in half, &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d1b233e4-4ac2-41a0-abbb-8c3db9665bc8"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Starting October 12th, instead of requiring 1,000 subscribers, you’ll need more than 500 subscribers. In a tweet, YouTube said that will open up the feature to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057"&gt;“millions” more channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oFScVw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Community posts are coming to millions more channels!!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Starting October 12, 2021, we’re lowering the eligibility threshold for Community posts to channels with 500+ subscribers: &lt;a href="https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML"&gt;https://t.co/66SEhZ33ML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tips for getting started on the Community tab →&lt;a href="https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t"&gt;https://t.co/O3KnHNvk1t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/SB1pyfbgUz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SB1pyfbgUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1436002133178925057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2oeK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9409631?hl=en"&gt;Community posts&lt;/a&gt; are Facebook-like news or status updates from creators that can be found on a dedicated Community tab on their profile. Sometimes, you might also see them in the Home or Subscriptions tab. The feature was designed to replace the Discussion tab, which will be officially removed from all channels on October 12th, YouTube said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojwkra"&gt;For creators with fewer than 500 subscribers who want to use the Community posts feature, YouTube says it is “working to bring Community posts to you in the future,” suggesting that the feature could be rolled out more widely at some point. And once you do cross that 500-subscriber threshold, it might take up to a week until you can make Community posts, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s new ‘Enhance’ feature will spruce up your playlists with recommended songs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jeeb-C-FOvze86u1xH45PAKzRKs=/410x0:1510x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835309/Spotify_Enhance_PR_Static_1920x733.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="INFblk"&gt;Spotify is rolling out a new feature called “&lt;a href="https://pr-newsroom-wp.appspot.com/2021-09-09/get-perfect-song-recommendations-in-the-playlists-you-create-with-enhance/"&gt;Enhance&lt;/a&gt;,” which will automatically spiff up your playlists with recommended songs that (theoretically) fit in with your music’s existing style and theme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgLZZo"&gt;The feature works through a new Enhance button that now appears at the top of playlists. Tap it to toggle it on, which causes Spotify’s algorithm to automatically add recommended songs that it thinks will fit into your playlist. Enhance-recommended songs will be marked with a bright green sparkles icon to indicate that they weren’t part of your original list and can be added permanently by tapping the plus button that appears next to the song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OucB1g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify’s algorithm is here to spice up your playlists with new songs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l0qajo"&gt;Songs added through Enhance won’t replace or mess with your existing playlist songs, though, and can easily be removed by simply toggling off the Enhance button at the top of your playlist. You also won’t have to worry about the recommendations drowning out your original songs — Spotify will only add a maximum of 30 songs, with the additions spaced out after every two tracks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdfgoQ"&gt;Enhanced playlists are available on both Android and iOS and are set to roll out over the next month to Spotify Premium subscribers in the following countries: Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, and the US. The company notes that it’ll roll the feature out to additional countries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California advances bill targeting Amazon labor algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFtD_77gjad7YgsoneDn_Mo57tg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835223/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbtOLW"&gt;California is close to enacting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/6/22659681/california-law-productivity-algorithms-warehouse-fulfillment-center-labor"&gt;a first-of-its-kind law&lt;/a&gt; that would block Amazon and other companies from punishing warehouse workers who fail to meet certain performance metrics for taking rest or meal breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iPnye"&gt;If enacted, the bill, &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"&gt;AB 701&lt;/a&gt;, would allow warehouse workers to challenge performance goals that many say discourage them from taking bathroom breaks or other rest breaks throughout the work day. The bill was written in response to high rates of reported injuries at Amazon warehouses where performance quotas are algorithmically enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ogxo4F"&gt;The California Senate approved the measure on Wednesday, sending it back to the Assembly where minor changes can be made before it finally lands on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Newsom has not signaled whether he would sign the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uZZrNl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KD88R7"&gt;AB 701 does not explicitly name Amazon in its text, but both Republican and Democratic lawmakers recognize that the e-commerce giant would be greatly affected by the enactment of the legislation. Over the last few years, Amazon has come under intense criticism for its performance quotas with several outlets reporting that workers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;peed in bottles&lt;/a&gt; as a means of meeting their warehouse fulfillment goals and maintaining their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CetAi"&gt;The bill would also force companies like Amazon to make these performance algorithms more transparent, disclosing quotas to both workers and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR4iHS"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxRT26"&gt;Supporters of the legislation say that the bill would tamper down warehouse injuries, giving workers the opportunity to take breaks when over-stressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIBk89"&gt;“The bill is the first attempt to create transparency and protections against unsafe algorithmic-enforced quota systems used by corporations like to push warehouse workers’ bodies to the breaking point,” Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LorenaAD80/status/1435746747226066946?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ5EmZ"&gt;Business groups have come out &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/business/economy/amazon-labor-california-senate.html"&gt;in opposition of the bill&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that it would harm the industry by empowering employees to file lawsuits that could be costly and time-consuming for companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMOhBl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwmoCc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook debuts Ray-Ban Stories, smart glasses that record video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pEKV0lkZFdSz5PUMpVLINy12I-k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69835103/alopez_210907_4736_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hands-on with Facebook and Ray-Ban’s first pair of smart glasses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EGiRL1"&gt;Starting Thursday, the first pair of smart glasses made by Facebook and Ray-Ban are going on sale for $299. They’re called Ray-Ban Stories, and you’ll be able to find them pretty much anywhere Ray-Bans are sold, including LensCrafters and Sunglasses Hut stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFzGoM"&gt;The frames feature two-front facing cameras for capturing video and photos. They sync with a companion camera roll app called Facebook View, where clips can be edited and shared to other apps on your phone (not just Facebook’s own). There’s a physical button on the glasses for recording, or you can say “Hey Facebook, take a video” to control them hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1NJvz"&gt;And, perhaps most importantly, they look and feel like regular glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ASa5"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Glasses|103693" data-volume-uuid="78d3ba8ac" data-volume-id="103693" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-970" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj57zO"&gt;With their core ability of taking photos and videos, Ray-Ban Stories are essentially a sleeker version of Snapchat’s Spectacles, which first debuted in 2016 to a lot of hype that quickly fizzled. These Ray-Bans don’t have displays in the lenses, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;the latest Spectacles&lt;/a&gt; that were unveiled earlier this year. However, speakers on both sides of the frame can play sound from your phone over Bluetooth, allowing you to take a call or listen to a podcast without pulling your phone out. A touchpad built into the side of the frame lets you change the volume or play and pause what you’re hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnySmC"&gt;Ray-Ban Stories are the first product in a multiyear partnership between Facebook and the European eyewear conglomerate EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company. While they’re limited in what they can do, Ray-Ban Stories are the most normal-looking, accessible pair of smart glasses to hit the market so far. Both companies also see them as a step toward more advanced augmented reality glasses that overlay graphics onto the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TeMN230e_m9-6A92GnU_KXzzqXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834548/alopez_210907_4736_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KUFcVb"&gt;After testing a pair of Ray-Ban Stories for the past week, I’m impressed with the build quality and how well they work. Initial pairing was easy, and syncing footage from the glasses back to the View app took only a few seconds through a Wi-Fi connection the glasses initiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBe3At"&gt;The dual 5-megapixel cameras can capture just over three dozen, 30-second video clips or roughly 500 photos before the on-device memory fills up. A physical button on the top of the right side of the frame lets you manually capture if you’d rather not use the “Hey Facebook” wake phrase. (Facebook says its voice assistant only listens for that phrase when turned on and that its functionality is limited to starting recordings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CSUab"&gt;A light on the inside of the glasses gives you a range of information: green for fully charged, orange for low battery, blue for pairing mode, red for dead battery or overheating, and white for a capture error. A separate, front-facing white light next to the right camera illuminates whenever the glasses are recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym00sPuEzaBp64U9vobYfRLkK6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834538/alopez_210907_4736_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vPcXmj"&gt;Facebook says the glasses take about an hour to fully charge and that the battery will last for roughly six hours with intermittent use. The companion View app shows a live readout of the battery when the glasses are paired. My battery drained by about 20 percent during heavy use for an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JkUNC"&gt;The carrying case that comes with the glasses is sturdy, with a leather-like material and built-in charger that can refill the battery three times. The case itself charges via a USB-C cable that comes in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97j6jK"&gt;I expected the speakers on both sides of the frame to be soft and hollow, but they were surprisingly loud and full. I can see the audio playback over Bluetooth coming in handy for taking phone calls or maybe listening to podcasts, but I’d prefer to use proper headphones for listening to music. The audio doesn’t sound specifically targeted at the wearer’s ears, making it easy to overhear when you’re standing next to someone wearing the glasses. The touchpad on the side of the frame is a welcome inclusion for volume adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SXXAKx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Ray-Ban Glasses|103808" data-volume-uuid="434156c64" data-volume-id="103808" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-400" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A video I shot of my dog Otis with Ray-Ban Stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPGqi1"&gt;The cameras in the glasses are nowhere as high quality as the cameras on modern smartphones. Instead, Ray-Ban Stories are meant to be used in moments when your hands are occupied, or you want to capture something fleeting. Despite a teaser video recently posted by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113884054500281"&gt;showing him out in the ocean with them on&lt;/a&gt;, the glasses aren’t designed to get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSfNpw"&gt;The companion View app is bare-bones, serving as a camera roll for the glasses with basic editing capabilities. You can favorite clips and do minor touch-ups before sending footage to any app of your choice. During initial setup, it walks you through the privacy policy that asks to let Facebook collect data about how you use the glasses. A Facebook account is required to use them, but the company isn’t analyzing what you record and save in the View app to personalize ads to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FL9A5a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The most compelling part of Ray-Ban Stories is the form factor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYiFHR"&gt;The most compelling part of Ray-Ban Stories is the form factor. I’ve tried a bunch of smart glasses over the years, and these are by far the most comfortable. They weigh just a few grams heavier than normal Wayfarers. You’ll also be able to get them with prescription lenses (although my ability to test the glasses was limited since the pair Facebook sent me to try didn’t have my prescription and I don’t wear contacts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jc4P8U"&gt;The tech in the glasses is so hidden that it’s hard to tell there are cameras on them at all. The white recording light is also fairly dim, which could pose privacy concerns if people don’t realize the glasses are capturing photos or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTFh0H"&gt;As far as smart glasses go, Ray-Ban Stories are relatively affordable. They start at $299, with polarized lenses bringing the price to $329 and transition lenses costing $379. The price for adding a prescription varies based on the type of insurance. There are three main frame styles: Wayfarer, Round, and Meteor. In total there are 20 combinations of styles, colors, sizes, and lens types. They are initially being sold online and in stores in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0jhqkfmm_34qLQtVvlWMhmIqRdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834539/alopez_210907_4736_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Jz4Oz9"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban have a unique partnership that was formed at the highest levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEpice"&gt;The two companies first connected over two years ago when Luxottica’s chief wearable officer, Rocco Basilico, cold emailed Mark Zuckerberg asking to meet and discuss collaborating on smart glasses. Zuckerberg had publicly laid out Facebook’s aspiration to build AR glasses that could one day be as widely adopted as mobile phones. In a 2017 speech at Facebook’s developer conference, he showed the crowd a mockup of smart glasses that looked similar to Ray-Bans. Basilico was leading Luxottica’s own smart glasses efforts at the time and knew the eyewear giant needed to partner with a tech company to build them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gi73GY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not just a technological gadget, but something sexy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gGntT6"&gt;The deal was sealed when Zuckerberg flew to Milan in early 2019 to meet with Leonardo Del Vecchio, Luxottica’s founder and chairman. The two men agreed on the main proposition of the product. Facebook’s hardware executives traveled to tour Luxottica’s sprawling research center in northern Italy. Most of the features of the glasses (codenamed “Stella”) were decided during a weeklong workshop with top executives from both companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAOuqA"&gt;These Ray-Bans are decidedly not a Facebook-branded product, like its Oculus VR headset or Portal video calling device lineup. Facebook is supplying the tech and software that powers the glasses, while Ray-Ban oversees the design and sale of them. Both companies declined to discuss the financial details of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wPFpW"&gt;The goal of Ray-Ban Stories is to “lay the groundwork in the minds of consumers for the many, many, future products that we have to come in this space,” Facebook’s vice president of augmented and virtual reality, Andrew Bosworth, told me. It’s all part of Facebook’s goal to build what it thinks will be the next major computing platform after mobile phones. The company has over 10,000 people making consumer hardware, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;including a smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; it plans to help control its eventual AR glasses, which are internally codenamed “Orion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UdfnE"&gt;For Luxottica, the idea was to make smart glasses “not just a technological gadget, but something sexy,” according to Basilico. “We started with a sleek design and then we retrofitted the technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oLkssXEfcfGNLeNnt0WUWTo3Tyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834551/alopez_210907_4736_0019.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewodU1"&gt;Luxottica deciding to partner with Facebook could also be an offensive move to get ahead of the coming smart glasses boom. Snap began giving its first iteration of Spectacles with AR displays to a handful of developers and partners earlier this year. Apple is working on its own AR glasses that are still several years out. In June of last year, Google bought the AR glasses startup North, signaling its interest in re-entering the consumer market after Google Glass failed nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEt1Th"&gt;If AR glasses do eventually become as ubiquitous as mobile phones, traditional eyewear companies like Luxottica won’t want to be caught flat-footed, according to Christopher Grayson, an AR and smart glasses analyst who has closely studied the luxury eyewear market. “You don’t want to be the taxicab industry when Uber shows up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRPjTz"&gt;In doing camera-equipped smart glasses, Facebook has also found one of the last things to copy from Snapchat. Both Bosworth and Basilico didn’t mention Spectacles by name in our conversations, but it was clear that they think Ray-Ban Stories are going to be more universally appealing than Spectacles. And they’re probably right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GGvKyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re going to have people use this device in unintended ways”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mVve5"&gt;“Things that appear to be like this have hit the market before, but nothing in terms of having super accessible design and all the features around the hands-free assistant and the audio,” said Bosworth. (Snap approached Luxottica to partner in the early days of Spectacles but the talks ultimately went nowhere, according to people involved in the discussions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvVBxI"&gt;Facebook sent me a list of advocacy groups that it consulted with on privacy-related issues during the development of the glasses, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the LGBT Technology Partnership. The people I spoke with said Facebook took their feedback seriously, and that they overall feel comfortable with how the product is designed. But some agreed that the recording light should be more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7eQUb"&gt;There will likely be resistance by some to wearing cameras and microphones made by Facebook, regardless how well the glasses are designed. But given how Facebook’s brand is nowhere to be found on the glasses themselves, I’m not sure that stigma will significantly hinder interest in Ray-Ban Stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UGmMz"&gt;The broader implications of smart glasses are still unknown. If they are eventually adopted by lots of people, they could have a chilling effect on the comfort others have in public spaces or become a tool for stalking, Jeremy Greenberg, counsel for the Future of Privacy Forum, told me. “You’re going to have people use this device in unintended ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qcNJyk"&gt;While it’s operating at a trust deficit, Facebook hopes that products like Ray-Ban Stories can avoid past mishaps and show that it’s keeping privacy in mind. “Getting products into market that start that dialogue with consumers around wearable glasses, it’s so important to us,” said Bosworth. “It’s important to do it in advance of the things to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego’s latest Mario collaboration is a big question mark block</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIq6eesHMRHS6vNrVu2RHAc8qH0=/0x0:960x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834949/71395_LSM_2HY21_Cons_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qUou5M"&gt;Lego’s latest Mario-themed set is a giant homage to &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, a giant question mark block that unfolds to reveal four levels from the Nintendo 64 game: Peach’s Castle; Bob-omb Battlefield; Cool, Cool Mountain; and Lethal Lava Trouble. The “Lego Super Mario 64 ? Block set,” to use its official title, is made up of over two thousand pieces and will cost $169.99 when it goes on sale in Lego’s stores on October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGY9Co"&gt;From the trailer released today, the set looks great: four blocky dioramas of a game that itself looks pretty blocky by modern standards. But I have to split hairs and point out that, as far as I’m aware, the question mark block never actually appears in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously, go back and look at screenshots if you don’t believe me! Those blocks have &lt;a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_64#:~:text=A%20floating,Power%20Stars."&gt;little exclamation marks on them&lt;/a&gt;, not question marks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foKq5xD4_aWWLdjQGiT5MICA72A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837008/71395_LSM_2HY21_Lifestyle_02__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block opens to reveal four levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1mNx5ZbsU07Hm5UYXhfpiIMkJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837009/71395_LSM_2HY21_Lifestyle_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego’s previous Mario figures work with the new set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eDoLnN"&gt;Along with the levels, you also get a few figurines of characters from the original game, including Princess Peach, King Bob-omb, Chain Chomp, and of course, Mario himself. If you’ve been keeping up with Lego’s previous Mario sets, then you’ll be happy to hear that your existing Lego Mario and Luigi figurines will also work with the set and will apparently unlock unique music and sounds when placed in the levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83xqtt"&gt;The announcement of the new set suggests that Lego has no intention of bringing its collaborations with Nintendo to an end. The Danish toy company released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;first Mario set last year&lt;/a&gt; and added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393486/luigi-lego-super-mario-interactive-sets-nintendo-starter-course"&gt;Luigi figurine into the mix in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571141/tanooki-mario-lego-set-power-up-pack-maker-expansion-piranha-chain-chomp"&gt;other expansion sets&lt;/a&gt;. It also produced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322481/lego-nintendo-nes-super-mario-interactive-set-replica"&gt;blocky replica of the original Nintendo Entertainment System console&lt;/a&gt; alongside a miniature retro TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEjUoH"&gt;Personally, though, I’m crossing my fingers that these sets are popular enough to get Lego to consider some sets based on Nintendo’s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; major franchises like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;. Plumber’s are great and all, but I’d find it pretty hard to resist having a small Lego replica of Samus Aran’s spaceship on my shelf. Maybe one day? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s first Windows 11 commercial features Master Chief blowing stuff up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BmFIHeuXC_bkW1YJb8ZD22weR-I=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69834873/kjF2cQp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LCPbBY"&gt;Microsoft is debuting its first ad campaign for Windows 11 today. The 60-second TV commercial is set to “All Starts Now” by Odessa and features the new Microsoft Store, Master Chief from the world of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, Microsoft Teams, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9hUkW"&gt;Explaining what a new version of Windows will bring to consumers is never easy, and Microsoft has opted for a similar approach to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;first Xbox Series X commercial&lt;/a&gt;. An actress walks through walls of apps and selects Xbox Game Pass, which triggers Master Chief to appear and blast a &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;banshee out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOBxT2nU8TR5BMGZw2g-jkBcl8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837038/kjF2cQp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief appears and blows up a Halo banshee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AiAuxM"&gt;The new bloom default wallpaper in Windows 11 also appears, alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548738/microsoft-teams-windows-11-integration-announcement-features"&gt;built-in Microsoft Teams experience&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s commercial focuses less on Windows 11 features, and more on making the OS appear... pretty. I think that’s largely the point, though. Microsoft has spent a lot of time on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;tweaking the design and visuals&lt;/a&gt; in Windows 11, with an aim of simplifying its operating system. The tagline of this commercial is “brings you closer to what you love,” presumably by removing some of the clutter that exists in Windows today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9HeGb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;launch Windows 11 on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, with new devices from partners and even its own Surface hardware. Microsoft will hold a separate Surface event on September 22nd, where we’re expecting to see a new Surface Go 3, Surface Pro 8, Surface Pro X, and a new Surface Book-like device all ready for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
