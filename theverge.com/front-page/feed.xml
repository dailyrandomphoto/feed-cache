    <title>Spotify is acquiring an audiobook company </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gaq6WhZhqk-YiB1o-171qD_L7SU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129483/acastro_180213_1777_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EVy8u"&gt;Spotify has announced plans to acquire the audiobook services and distribution company Findaway for an undisclosed price. The company operates multiple businesses, including distributing audiobooks to various platforms and offering audiobook creation services under its business Findaway Voices. The company pairs authors with narrators, which could become a new and valuable source of revenue for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31AsA"&gt;It also makes Spotify both a commercial bookseller and a publisher of audiobooks, a title the company has been hesitant to accept for its podcasting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1js05"&gt;“With this acquisition, we’re going to be able to accelerate the addition of an audiobook catalog onto the platform so that users can effectively get all of the audio content that they want all on one platform,” says Nir Zicherman, head of audiobooks at Spotify, in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5ebJt"&gt;Zicherman says the team is focusing on “innovation” in the space to make audiobooks a “richer experience,” as well as “democratization,” in that more people can create and publish more audiobooks. It also wants to work on audiobook discovery, as it has always focused on with music and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YWw8Ga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XLnUqb"&gt;Zicherman declined to share any specifics on exclusives that might factor into Spotify’s audiobook strategy but did praise the company’s work with creators. “Voices currently allows creators to distribute broadly,” he says, “and that is a very important part of the offering and something that we plan to keep and to continue supporting because we think that it’s part of what makes the platform so powerful from a creator standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgbYzf"&gt;Zicherman also says the core Spotify app will likely gain more audiobooks in early 2022 when certain Open Access partnerships begin distributing content there. (Storytel, a major audiobook streaming app, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-20/storytel-audiobooks-will-be-available-on-spotify-later-this-year/"&gt;is an initial partner&lt;/a&gt;.) These moves aren’t the first to signal Spotify’s interest in the audiobook space, however. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248393/spotify-audiobook-exclusive-recordings-david-dobrick-hilary-swank"&gt;worked with&lt;/a&gt; YouTubers and celebrities in January to distribute readings of classic books, like &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247804/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reading-philosophers-stone-spotify-video"&gt;partnered with J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World&lt;/a&gt; to release &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone &lt;/em&gt;in audio form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YskJj"&gt;Most importantly, the acquisition will give Spotify a new way to make money while staying in the audio business. Findaway shares in authors’ royalties, which means that whenever someone streams a Findaway-distributed book on the platform, Spotify will make money. It’ll also take some cut of revenue when people buy a book on the platform, like any retailer. (A spokesperson declined to comment on its monetization plans.) It seems possible Spotify could launch new subscription tiers, similarly to Audible, to account for audiobook consumption. Notably, however, Spotify will also have to pay royalties to other audiobook distributors and authors, similar to how it treats music content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Pay seems buggy with external Magic Keyboard Touch ID</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVWK2Xsofm63cVZz5P5ibWwItNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129372/akrales_20210515_4583_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), the limitation is so awkward that it feels like a bug. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs and comes with all but the base-level iMac. That means that most of the people buying it will likely be laptop users looking for a way to type while their laptop is docked (maybe even with the screen closed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYYp5l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it’s safe enough for an M1 Mac Mini, it’s safe enough for a docked MacBook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fiiiec"&gt;Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment about whether the behavior was intentional or a mistake. Either way, hopefully, it’ll let its users make payments with their external keyboard soon, no matter what the state of their laptop’s lid is. It’s understandable that Apple wants to make sure that payment authentication is a secure process — &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; mentions a load of other security settings that could affect being able to use Touch ID with Apple Pay — but if it’s safe enough to use with the M1 Mac Mini, it should be safe enough to use with a docked laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch Valve’s Steam Deck developer event at 1PM ET Friday, even if you’re not a dev</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHDLvIfP1m3i957I3kDG5ktilC4=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129264/STEAMDECK_THUMB_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TJLYVt"&gt;We’ve known for a little while that Valve is giving developers a huge five-hour tour of its upcoming Steam Deck gaming handheld on Friday, November 12th starting at 1PM ET. Now, we’re learning &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/steamworksvirtualconference/steamdeck"&gt;you can come watch&lt;/a&gt; even if you’re not a developer — Valve is telling press that “anyone can watch the event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMQ2gu"&gt;The five-hour virtual conference will include discussions of the hardware; games that will appear &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/"&gt;“on Deck”&lt;/a&gt;; how the Linux handheld can play Windows games via a Proton compatibility layer; a deep dive on the AMD APU that powers it by AMD itself; and of course tips for Steam developers on how to make those things work in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MadBBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s free to watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vix6QQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104662546549776336"&gt;The initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; made it seem like you had to be a Steamworks developer “to participate,” but the company’s clarifying today that only applies to a final Q&amp;amp;A session (and possibly only when it comes to asking the questions: it sounds like you can still watch that, too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUQYvl"&gt;Valve is a gigantic force in the PC gaming space, but it’s also a secretive company that doesn’t make a lot of hardware, so there’s loads of interest in any scrap of new information about the exciting new gaming handheld that might come out of the event. We’ll be watching for any news — and now you can, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3gM8X"&gt;Me, I’ll be particularly interested if Valve drops any more tidbits about what else the AMD APU can do. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;When I got to try the Steam Deck in person&lt;/a&gt; in Bellevue, Washington, Valve’s Greg Coomer kinda-sorta hinted to me that it might make sense in a possible future standalone VR headset, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXG2KW"&gt;Valve recently announced that the Steam Deck has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed by two months&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, small quantities were expected to ship this December, but now the first handhelds will arrive in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I just bought a $329 Nvidia RTX 3060 for $329, and all I had to do was wait nine months in line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mw6LBXY92_u2mo1PaqQuHBa1jz8=/0x102:2791x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129121/verge_sean_hollister_evga_rtx_3060_20211111_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERjrAP"&gt;Nearly nine months ago, Nvidia said it would launch its most affordable RTX 3000 graphics card yet — the $329 RTX 3060. Good luck actually finding one at that price, right? That’s why I subtitled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt; “$329 with an asterisk sign.” And sure enough, they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;nigh-impossible to find on launch day&lt;/a&gt; for Nvidia’s sticker price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAFqs2"&gt;But that same day, February 25th, I signed up for EVGA’s graphics card &lt;em&gt;waiting queue&lt;/em&gt; on a whim. And after waiting in that queue for so long that I completely forgot I ever signed up, I got a surprise. On Monday, I received an email from EVGA letting me know I could actually purchase that $329 card for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql4mzI"&gt;So I did. Yesterday afternoon, a brand-new RTX 3060 arrived for $379.41 after tax and shipping. That’s a card that’s generally selling for north of $700 on eBay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fX78EV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Queues work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L87V8T"&gt;The queue worked! It remembered me, and it gave me what I wanted once it was ready. I never needed to wake up early and smash browser refresh buttons, never needed to throw down with scalpers, never needed to pre-fill my credit card information into half a dozen websites, never needed to pay an exorbitant finder’s fee. I just had to register an account and try EVGA’s two-step verification a few times (the website choked for me at first), and then I had 20 full hours to complete my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeMH5k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;We called out the industry in late 2020&lt;/a&gt; for failing to let us simply sign up to buy products when they’re ready to ship, the way Apple, Samsung, and others have done. But there’s been little movement since. While Sony did finally introduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726198/ps5-playstation-5-sony-console-registration-restock-november-invite"&gt;a way to register your interest in buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt; last month, and Valve did introduce a first-come-first-served reservation system alongside its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;now-delayed&lt;/a&gt;) Steam Deck handheld, most people who simply want to buy a new console or a new PC graphics card are at the mercy of the internet feeding frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="y9E78D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="chpD80"&gt;How has a tiny company like EVGA, one of Nvidia’s board partners, figured out what almost every other company hasn’t? Well, it’s not quite that simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4uDce"&gt;For one thing, as we pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;in that late 2020 story&lt;/a&gt;, there are some perverse incentives that may keep companies from fixing the mess. Scarcity isn’t always a bad thing for retailers since it drives word-of-mouth, and some people may give up on the thing they came to buy and buy something else instead. (Big-box retailers also love the frenzy of in-person Black Friday shopping sprees, for that matter, even though people can get hurt and even killed in a stampede. At least that’s not a concern here.) But EVGA wins when you can buy a graphics card, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of its new cards are in high demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9bD9z"&gt;But also, EVGA isn’t actually satisfied that it’s figured out the queue quite yet. If you want to follow my lead and join the queue, you actually can’t — the company shut down its queues about a month ago after feedback that it still wasn’t quite fair. The company’s tweaked its queue system &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/evga-improves-queue-system-for-rtx-30-series-cards-after-backlash-from-waiting-consumers/"&gt;a few times now&lt;/a&gt;, but there are still concerns that, for instance, some users were able to purchase multiple cards instead of just one for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ayj9Hf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This new queue may have some new rules and requirements”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oopm07"&gt;“After taking much feedback, we are working on a new version for [the] future with improvements to speed up queue fulfillment and fairness. This new queue may have some new rules and requirements, so for the time being, we have closed the existing queue for new signups as we continue to fulfill those in line, and plan to have more announcements in the near future,” EVGA tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwnwRP"&gt;Hopefully, EVGA can share its learnings with some other companies, too, because we’re not liking the way the industry is pointed now: it feels like retailers themselves are starting to become the scalpers, in a sense. Walmart and Best Buy offer paid memberships, in addition to Amazon’s Prime, that just so happen to let you into their member-exclusive sales — many of which are for in-demand tech, like consoles. They’ll tell you that’s not the primary purpose of these services, but for now, it seems like retailers are capitalizing on the scarcity of this gaming hardware with an upcharge instead of committing to making the lines work for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3xSip"&gt;That means you may have to wait twice: once for companies like EVGA to create the line and then again &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;the line to actually get your new console or GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a room, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, especially as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; begin to ramp in preparation for the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6mj5"&gt;Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now. Be sure to keep an eye on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday hub&lt;/a&gt; as well, which will continue to highlight the latest Black Friday news, tip, and deals through the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BDRU5"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $50, the original list price. Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information for an additional $10 more, bringing the price to $60. Note, however, that both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices. Both can also be picked up with a Sengled smart bulb at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7P5bD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, are also offering the fourth-gen Dot at full price, with both retailers taking $10 off if you buy two — meaning you’d pay $90 instead of $100 for a pair. Best Buy, however, will also throw in a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum in addition to a Sengled smart bulb with each purchase. The same promotions apply to the fourth-gen Dot with the built-in LED display, which is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-clock-and-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795704%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYzQMDs5Oi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $60, the full retail price. The only difference is that Best Buy is not currently offering $10 off when you purchase two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently selling for $60, its full price, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. However, the retail giant is also selling a discounted bundle for $75 instead of $90, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502549%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is selling the Kids Edition for $60 as well, but you’ll get $10 off if you buy two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Like the fourth-gen Dot, you can, however, get a 25 percent discount when you trade in a select device at Amazon. Target is also currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939S1B5R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with the singer’s image pasted on the side for $230.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 5 is currently available for $85 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its typical retail price. If you’re looking to save some money, however, the 2019 model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $40 instead of $80. Again, Amazon will take 25 percent off on either version if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="6d2iBD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for full price ($95) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110 through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitors in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the Echo Show 8 to be better than other devices in Amazon’s current smart display lineup, which is why we think it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;As far as deals go, the first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though, there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $115, for instance, you can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 and a Blink Mini security camera&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $131 instead of $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-gen Echo Show 8 is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $130, its full retail price. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Blink Mini for $135 instead of $165, or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini for $260 instead of $285. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qe3Eto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Qus6Ft"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>DJI Mavic 3 review: a pricey drone that performs</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine are incredible photo and video tools — for a price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QtmqPL"&gt;DJI may have a wide range of drones in its portfolio, but it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22759660/dji-flagship-prores-mavic-3-cine-drone"&gt;Mavic line&lt;/a&gt; that symbolizes the beginning of a new era for DJI drones. With the latest Mavic 3, DJI is introducing dual camera systems with hybrid zoom lenses, built-in SSDs, ability to shoot ProRes video, and better autonomous features. It’s a blend of pro-focused photo and video features with an easy-to-fly and easy-to-transport drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDnigu"&gt;There are two drones to choose from — the standard $2,199 Mavic 3 ($2,999 if you buy the Fly More bundle) and the Mavic 3 Cine. Some of the mentioned features, like the ProRes 422 HQ video and 1TB built-in SSD, are reserved for the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine. And let’s get this out of the way: it is the best consumer drone for video and photography you can buy right now. But that doesn’t mean it’s the drone for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YP7ld5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10858104"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ffvyno"&gt;When folded, the Mavic 3 is essentially the same size as its predecessor, the Mavic 2 Pro. It’s a bit longer but about the same height and just slightly heavier. Basically, it has the same footprint as before, and you won’t notice much of a difference carrying it in your bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwVbZI"&gt;The wingspan and, therefore, the arms are a bit longer, which adds more room for slightly longer propellers. You’ll notice the drone is larger when unfolded. One benefit of these larger propellers is that the Mavic 3 is slightly quieter in the air. In my testing, the difference in loudness is -3.6 dB, but the pitch of the Mavic 3 has more bass, which is always nice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II1M9x"&gt;The new camera module is big. It houses the main 24mm lens and also this 28x hybrid zoom lens above it. It does stick out, which is both good and bad — it’s bad because it leaves the camera exposed, so any potential crashes might be catastrophic. Luckily, I didn’t find myself in that situation. But it’s good because this camera can tilt upwards by quite a bit — almost 30 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPaZ5valqfmqgq2PPf-QNn_vDTE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003735/vpavic_211103_4871_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main camera has a 4/3-inch sensor, and the telephoto lens has a separate 1/2-inch CMOS sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KYJOsD"&gt;One neat little new feature I greatly appreciate is that the gimbal locks itself after each flight so it won’t dangle around in transport. The camera cover looks like a muzzle and is downright strange. It’s made out of faux leather, cradles the camera system, and wraps around the drone lengthwise, holding the propellers in place. It’s an improvement over the gimbal covers that usually required an engineering degree just to figure out how to put one on, but it’s still a bit odd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eCOVq"&gt;As I mentioned, DJI released two Mavic 3s. I have only been testing the Cine version. Aside from the 1TB SSD, which, unfortunately, is not user-replaceable, and ProRes 422 HQ video, all the other specs and features are identical between them. The Mavic 3 can shoot 5.1K video up to 50fps, 4K video up to 120fps, or 1080p up to 200fps. It has 46 minutes of flight time and uses DJI’s latest OcuSync 3+ with 15km of range. Out of all those improvements over the Mavic 2 Pro, the one I noticed the most was the battery life.  &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwJH-Mmd0w57Bmk2By-HkDEPf7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003728/vpavic_211103_4871_0059.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 both share a 46-minute battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaZHYy"&gt;It’s rare that you actually get the full 46 minutes of flight time, but it still is a significant improvement over the 31 minutes I’d typically see on the Mavic 2 Pro. As someone who is accustomed to maximizing battery life with each flight, I was pleasantly surprised when I’d glance over at my controller and find out I still have around 70–75% battery. If you buy the $4,999 Cine model, you get three batteries and plenty of flight time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6XRcn"&gt;Both the Cine Premium bundle and the $2,999 Fly More Combo bundle come with a charging hub, and the reason why I’m devoting a whole paragraph to it is that it finally supports USB-C. You can charge the batteries with basically anything that supports USB-C, including your portable battery packs or car chargers. Just note that each one of those 5000mAh batteries takes a while to charge, even with a high wattage charger, so plan accordingly. It took me about an hour and 45 minutes to charge from 11% to 100% using a 65W brick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiRb5v"&gt;This new camera module houses two sensors. The one you should care about more is the new 4/3-inch sensor, which is to say it’s a third of an inch larger than the Mavic 2 Pro. It is also a 4:3 sensor, which means your photos are no longer in 3:2 aspect ratio. With increase in sensor size, you get better noise handling, richer detail, greater dynamic range, reduced diffraction, and better control over depth of field — effectively better image quality all around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6LxNmx4_oP3D93iPjl9nBctmK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003730/vpavic_211103_4871_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both drones shoot 20MP photos, but in a 4:3 aspect ratio, not 3:2 as before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pz9oVV"&gt;I have been impressed with how the drone handles noise at higher ISO. I don’t want to oversell it; there is still a good amount of noise, but the differences between the two drones have been easy to spot — for both video and photo. I still wouldn’t film over ISO 3200, and ISO 6400 is definitely pushing it past my comfort zone. You can get away with showing it on something like a phone, but it might not be suitable for larger displays. Chances are you likely won’t film with ISO levels that high anyway, but it’s good to see those improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvwDlL"&gt;But when it comes to ProRes video, don’t expect any major noticeable improvements.  Looking at the same clips shot in ProRes and H.264 codec, it’s very hard to pick out any changes. ProRes is really here for professional filmmakers who are dependent on filming and delivering assets in ProRes. For lots of other drone videographers, ProRes might be overkill. Besides, Mavic 3’s maximum video bitrate is 200mbps, compared to Mavic 2 Pro’s 100mbps, so there’s already enough improvement in video quality between those two drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjxtJV"&gt;This new camera can also shoot 4K up to 120FPS. And personally, I usually shoot everything in 24fps, but I’m truly over the moon that we can now shoot 120FPS in 4K. However, there is significant cropping, so even while the footage still looks good, know that you’re not using the entire sensor when in this mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzsL38"&gt;When it comes to photos, the differences between the two drones are not as obvious. You might find it surprising that the Mavic 3 dynamic range is rated for 12.8 stops compared to Mavic 2 Pro’s 14 stops of DR — but that doesn’t tell the whole story. In practice, I didn’t really feel like I was losing much dynamic range between the two drones when editing photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="3bgHPG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10859700"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt7aBG"&gt;Cranking up the shadows and dropping the highlights in this single photo, there’s not much difference between the two, and chances are you really won’t notice it day to day. I know I haven’t. There is still a lot of information saved up in the RAW photos, and you can reveal a lot of info from a single photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUKJtW"&gt;ISO handling has also been improved. Some of the photos taken with ISO 1600 or 3200 look better than I expected them to. When comparing it directly with the Mavic 2 Pro, there are significant improvements with clarity in objects further away in the frame, and the overall noise grain looks a lot smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00O6MVnCLRw68vWHHHA--OpDlBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003776/fullsize_Iso_compDJI_0696.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISO comparison from 200 — 6400&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl7DH2"&gt;Upon hearing the photo specs for this camera, I was a little bit worried that we’re not getting much improvement between Mavic 3, Mavic 2 Pro, or even Air 2S. It was still “just” 20MP and rated for less dynamic range than before. I would’ve still liked a megapixel increase as I think the ability to zoom and crop after the fact is a lot more useful with drone photography than other disciplines. But there’s more detail available, even if you have to go hunting to find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SizV0O"&gt;It’s worth noting that the minimal shutter speed is 2 seconds. Long exposure drone photos are often hard to pull off, but I do wish that shutter speed was longer. Lastly, aperture is adjustable from f/2.8 all the way to f/11, which works for both photos and videos, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPfTcZ"&gt;Which brings me to the final thing I want to talk about, and that is the hybrid lens. To put it simply — I don’t love it. I understand why it exists, but I’m not convinced it’s necessary. It’s fun, sure, and sometimes you can find some cool things or just look around, but that’s about it. Don’t expect to use it to actually capture jaw-dropping videos or photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="1Xq12h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10858048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhGTpp"&gt;It is an entirely separate camera mounted above the main camera, complete with its own lens and ½” CMOS sensor. It is capable of a 28x zoom or 162mm in focal length at f/4.4 aperture; however, the aperture number here isn’t as important since all the zoom is digital. You can’t shoot in ProRes with it — understandable. And you can’t shoot in D-log — less understandable. And you’re locked in at 4K or 1080p @ 30FPS. You also can’t take RAW photos, only 12MP jpegs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsvFzK"&gt;When you enter the “explore mode” by tapping on the binoculars icon, you enable digital zoom. At first, that digital zoom is happening on the main lens, and I think 2x zoom looks decent. Once you get to 7x zoom, that’s when the switch happens, and the hybrid lens “takes over.” And at that 7x, it actually looks good. There’s a big difference between the 6.9x on the main camera and the 7x on the telephoto lens. But once you start going to 14x or 28x, it’s really not something you’d proudly post on your portfolio. The overall dropoff in quality between the two lenses is a little jarring at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppD3ZP"&gt;There’s a new remote controller in the Cine Premium bundle; it’s very similar to the Smart Controller that came out a few years ago. It has a great screen, performance is snappy, and a redesigned OS built on Android is good. It doesn’t have exceptional battery life, though. I get anywhere from 3–6 hours, depending mostly on the screen brightness. Range is also comparable to the standard remote controller, which is an improvement over the original Smart Controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlCrE6biSGlBX3tcXbywUfNFjCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003738/vpavic_211103_4871_0144.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned OS on the DJI RC Pro is much nicer and more simplified than on the original DJI Smart Controller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4g1a39"&gt;There are new obstacle sensors on this drone. They are still omnidirectional but fortunately not as sensitive or as obnoxiously loud as before. The app numerically tells you precisely how close you are to objects (in either feet or meters), and that really really helps when flying near objects. And, as per usual, they don’t work unless there’s adequate light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvVK1z"&gt;The new OcuSync 3+ is fantastic. I didn’t anticipate liking it as much as I did, but I really noticed a difference, particularly with the overall steadiness of the connection. Going behind buildings or trees wasn’t a problem as much as it was with many other drones I’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOBGzk"&gt;Last two things: APAS 5.0 and Active Track. I didn’t have time to test it properly because those features weren’t available during my testing period. APAS got enabled a few days ago, and from very little testing I did, I do like what I’m seeing. Mavic 3’s sensors are able to register objects as far away as 200 meters, and it really helps with how the drone predicts its pathway and autonomously avoids obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eObJ1_l6sLgxrJhCaFWAilOdpgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003733/vpavic_211103_4871_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Omnidirectional sensors are not new for the flagship Mavic drones but are a lot more responsive this time around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gsgZKQgpZkRvTEDltzdsvO_5ac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003731/vpavic_211103_4871_0081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frontal sensors can now detect objects that are 650 feet away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mHdyX"&gt;But the Active Track 5.0 is still not ready. And DJI says it will be ready in January. It is a real shame. I have high hopes for Active Track, and I’m curious to see how it works paired with the upgraded APAS 5.0. I’m expecting some major improvement from DJI in this category. Everyone is waiting for them to catch up with Skydio, and that is a very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaIN21"&gt;There are things I was hoping to see in this drone after following years of rumors. One of which is built-in ND filters. It’s not here. Part of me was hoping for interchangeable lenses, and I still think those would be more useful than the hybrid lens. But I do agree with a lot of the decisions DJI made — increasing the sensor size instead of simply slapping an 8K sticker on the drone for one. And by enabling 4K up to 120FPS and adding ProRes video, this drone is now very close to an Inspire 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Otcwm4"&gt;But I also have to say that the product, as a whole, feels a bit unfinished. Aside from Active Track, some of the other features just weren’t available during my testing — including panorama photos, Mastershots, Quickshots, and hyperlapse. There is a wide-angle lens attachment coming out soon, but I haven’t had a chance to test that either. All the core features that were available here work spectacularly well, but the rest still feel incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goqmwv"&gt;If you can afford it and know what you will use it for, the Mavic 3 is an easy recommendation. Most people can probably ignore the Cine model — $5,000 is a lot of money, and if you add warranty on top of that, and if you live in a place where you pay sales taxes, that price can go up really quickly. The standard Mavic 3 is also not really for beginners — if you’re a hobbyist or prosumer mostly posting on your social feeds, you can probably get away with an Air 2, 2S, or even a Mini 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="u9V9Vu"&gt;But if this isn’t your first drone, and you’re ready to step up to a new level of image quality, want the best of the best in a relatively small package, and have enough computing power to edit these massive files — you really can’t go wrong with the Mavic 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Xwv6e1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10858121"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9DW9kQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3RnZU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ADM6i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Starlink reveals new smaller, rectangular user dish to connect to satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BeTGF2gd7l76POoCr7_FFDI-dBc=/107x0:2354x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128513/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_12.14.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMj61A"&gt;SpaceX’s internet-from-space initiative Starlink has &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a new rectangular dish that interested customers can buy to tap into the company’s growing satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. It’s a thinner and lighter weight option than the circular dish that Starlink beta users have been testing over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40rhkK"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s satellite internet project, which aims to launch nearly 12,000 satellites into low Earth orbit where they can provide broadband internet coverage to people on the ground — notably those in remote and rural areas where traditional internet infrastructure is lacking. With so many satellites in low orbit at once, the idea is to have at least one satellite in view over every patch of the Earth, providing near continuous internet coverage to users. In order to tap into the system, users need to mount a dish somewhere near their home, like the roof, where they can get a clear view of the sky (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;free of trees&lt;/a&gt;) at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GWtUnO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX had filed a new application with the FCC for a smaller dish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Ytyw"&gt;SpaceX launched the beta version of Starlink in October 2020, allowing users in certain geographical areas of the US to purchase the company’s starter kit, which included a 23-inch-wide circular user terminal — or dish — mounting equipment, a Wi-Fi router, and all the cables one would need. The buy-in cost was $499 for the kit and then $99 a month for coverage. Now, users have the option to buy this new rectangular dish instead, which is just 12 inches wide and 19 inches long. At 9.2 pounds, it’s nearly half the weight of the original 16-pound dish. However, the price to buy the rectangular option appears unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LTki1"&gt;SpaceX had filed a new application with the Federal Communications Commission for a smaller dish, &lt;a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/swr031b.hts?q_set=V_SITE_ANTENNA_FREQ.file_numberC/File+Number/%3D/SESLIC2021070801019&amp;amp;prepare=&amp;amp;column=V_SITE_ANTENNA_FREQ.file_numberC/File+Number"&gt;which just received approval yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The 12-inch width notably matches the diameter of the antenna that rival internet satellite initiative, Project Kuiper, is hoping to build. When it unveiled its antenna, Project Kuiper claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;would reduce the overall cost of making the equipment&lt;/a&gt;. In August, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell argued that SpaceX’s new dishes would be much more cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufRr3a"&gt;“The ones we will have later this year will cost roughly half of what our current user terminals cost,” Shotwell said during a discussion at Space Symposium, an annual space conference, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-prepares-to-cut-starlink-dish-cost-by-half-later-this-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And then we think we’ll be able to cut that in half yet again.” Originally, the Starlink dishes cost $3,000 each for SpaceX to build, meaning the company was selling to users at a loss. However, Shotwell claimed in April that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/spacexs-shotwell-no-plan-for-tiered-starlink-internet-pricing.html"&gt;SpaceX was able to reduce that number to around $1,300&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqusjIfjgDB0UOPBjBb2O3XIr7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006108/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_11.24.31_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX / Starlink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparisons between the two antennas on Starlink’s website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qTCHxp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.starlink.com/topic?category=10"&gt;The company’s website&lt;/a&gt; notes that the rectangular dish comes with a new 3 x 3, MU-MIMO router, which does not come with a built-in ethernet port like its predecessor. SpaceX is offering an ethernet adapter for purchase, however, for those looking to hook up their devices via cables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxCOQ"&gt;Additionally, those buying the rectangular dish seem to have more accessory options when mounting the equipment to their house. &lt;a href="https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf"&gt;A new installation guide&lt;/a&gt; shows new types of poles that attach to the sides of housing, and even a long vertical pole that users can simply stick into the ground of their yards. The dish accessory guide notes that this option “requires digging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0lkn0"&gt;Starlink claims that “the rectangular Starlink is currently available for all new orders fulfilled in the United States.” However, it might be a while before customers actually see their dishes. After first accepting preorders in February, Starlink has steadily grown its user base, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556031/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-users-next-year-telecom-5g"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claiming&lt;/a&gt; in June that the program had 69,420 active users. He also predicted that Starlink would have 500,000 users in the next 12 months. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22760268/starlink-delay-order-location-map-satellite-internet"&gt;users have recently complained&lt;/a&gt; that tinkering with their addresses in Starlink’s online map tool leads to serious delays in their shipments. Additionally, Starlink states on its website that “silicon shortages have delayed production which has impacted our ability to fulfill orders.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panic’s Playdate handheld delayed to early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8dYc6XwiF4cs0b0RFlCxvX-QoQ=/0x2:1454x971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128501/F558C979_3BAF_4B2D_ADC3_CDFC275FFA64.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwRWqb"&gt;Panic has delayed the first shipments of its Playdate handheld, which is kind of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;a Game Boy but with a crank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/popagenda/playdate-2022-delay"&gt;to early 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that initial units shipped with batteries &lt;a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg"&gt;that didn’t work as expected&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to send the units back to Malaysia to get new batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIAPOp"&gt;Panic also said that it has been affected by the global chip shortage in a significant way. Additional supply of the Playdate’s current CPU won’t be available for &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;, according to Panic. To get around that, Playdate units coming later in 2022 will have a revised main board that uses a more readily available CPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdklB"&gt;If you preordered a Playdate, you should be receiving an email that says when your Playdate is now estimated to ship. Orders have now been put into five different groups, and your email should say which group you’re in. Panic cautions that its estimates are subject to change, so there could be more shifts down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ouRold"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The global chip shortage has had a major affect on gaming hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJxVH9"&gt;The news of the Playdate’s delay arrives one day after Valve’s Steam Deck was delayed by two months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;to February 2022&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;global supply chain issues&lt;/a&gt;. And they’re not the only gaming companies affected; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;Nintendo cut its Switch sales forecast&lt;/a&gt; due to the chip shortage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;Sony is reportedly making fewer PS5s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzMpGs"&gt;Panic also shared some news about Playdate’s development software. Pulp, the company’s no-code development tool, is set to arrive in public beta in January 2022, while the full Playdate SDK is scheduled to launch in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will let you easily share clips from its Prime Video content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82X3-rr72UGVphGZxYkBZyuTH30=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128465/amazon.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqEdCp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-unveils-interactive-clip-sharing-feature"&gt;Amazon has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll let you easily share video clips showing up to 30 seconds of some of its Prime Video content, right from its iPhone app. The feature will only be available for a very limited number of shows initially, but letting users share video from shows is a very different attitude than the one displayed by some other streaming providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piZge0"&gt;According to Amazon’s press release, its video-sharing feature will be available on iOS devices. When you’re watching a show, the Share Clip button will show up alongside the rest of your controls. Tapping it will create a 30-second video clip, which you can then fine-tune to make sure it contains the part of the show you’re trying to share. From there, you can share it using Apple’s built-in sharing feature, sending it to a friend over iMessage, or posting it on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELNwqVoqrKxyFfg6wPJWSpjjGlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006021/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_09.53.41.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The share a clip button pops up alongside the X-Ray info and brings you to a very Overcast clip sharing-esque interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L7EUkQ"&gt;When asked about whether the feature will be available on Android, an Amazon spokesperson told The Verge that clip share is currently only available to iPhone users with version 8.41 (or later) of the Prime Video app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdV2qs"&gt;It seems like an obvious feature for any streaming service to add — people genuinely like sharing clips from the shows they’re watching, and them doing so is basically free marketing for that show. However, Amazon’s competitors like Hulu and Netflix go in pretty much the exact opposite direction: when you take a screenshot while watching one of their shows, the video content just ends up blacked out, leaving you with just the subtitles if you have them turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ed-4LIQDGArfwCYyUyeUp9eCqcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006007/IMG_3154.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out this hilarious scene from Netflix Original BoJack Horseman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lr1L11"&gt;While this is perhaps an understandable tactic for third-party content (Netflix’s download feature also has some limitations on which shows you can download), for original shows made by the streaming services themselves, it feels like a missed opportunity to let people do marketing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKraL4"&gt;Amazon says you can only share clips from &lt;em&gt;The Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fairfax, &lt;/em&gt;and season one of &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; to start, but it will add more movies and shows later. It’s unclear if we’ll end up getting this feature for any non-Amazon content on Prime Video in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMxagW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 11th, 2:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information from Amazon about the availability of the feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MoviePass’ co-founder has bought back the company and wants to relaunch it next year</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7EGVG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iwantmoviepass.com/"&gt;MoviePass&lt;/a&gt; might be making a comeback soon, after Stacy Spikes (one of the service’s original co-founders) successfully bought back the company out of bankruptcy earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moviepass-cofounder-stacy-spikes-buys-back-company-and-plans-relaunch-2021-11"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spikes is hoping to relaunch the company sometime next year, although there are few details on that yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lBA1Is"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why MoviePass really failed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VTrhC9"&gt;“I can confirm that we acquired MoviePass out of bankruptcy on Wednesday,” Spikes commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “We are thrilled to have it back and are exploring the possibility of relaunching soon. Our pursuit to reclaim the brand was encouraged by the continued interest from the moviegoing community. We believe, if done properly, theatrical subscription can play an instrumental role in lifting moviegoing attendance to new heights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="google_ads_iframe_/4442842/business/tech/post_3__container__"&gt;MoviePass launched as original all-you-can-eat movie service all the way back in 2011, but skyrocketed to unprecedented levels of popularity in 2017, when the company sold a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150628/moviepass-pricing-subscription-fee-theaters"&gt;MoviePass dropped its monthly subscription to just $10 per month&lt;/a&gt;, a seemingly unsustainable deal that would see the company offering customers the option to see as many movies in a month as they wanted for less than the price of a single ticket in some pricier markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJUZwh"&gt;The company’s downfall only accelerated as the popularity of MoviePass grew. The idea behind the lower price (which &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-story-moviepass-rise-fall-2019-8"&gt;Spikes reportedly protested&lt;/a&gt; before he was fired in January 2018) was to leverage MoviePass’ larger user base to help negotiate favorable deals with theaters, gaining a cut of things like ticket sales or concessions. But that planed failed spectacularly, and by the end, the company was losing money on virtually every customer, stuck footing the bill for millions in tickets that it could scarcely afford. Attempts to salvage things by limiting tickets, blacking out popular films, and other restrictions couldn’t stave off the inevitable, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864873/moviepass-app-shutdown-out-of-business-movies-subscription"&gt;company shut down in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5yQrL"&gt;But MoviePass did help show that theatrical subscriptions could work, at least in theory, with major theater chains like AMC or Alamo Drafthouse offering their own (more expensive) services that offer similar deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVspB3"&gt;With Spikes back in charge, it seems doubtful that MoviePass’ return will feature the kind of impossible deals that the doomed service had offered before. But if Spikes actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pull off a comeback, it might offer useful competition to the in-house services at theaters that have since replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;
