    <title>Rad Power Bikes’ new RadCity e-bike makes commuting (and hill climbing) much easier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZOdFszHyomCTyBxFQ0GxAHfta0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892265/ahawkins_210914_4767_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9QUJke"&gt;Rad Power Bikes’ electric commuting bike, the RadCity, is getting a serious makeover. The Seattle-based company has completely redesigned the bike’s powertrain, including a semi-integrated battery, and made a number of other upgrades to make riding easier, faster, and more intuitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRiSDS"&gt;The RadCity 5 Plus is the second bike in Rad Power Bikes’ lineup to receive many of these design updates, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22583925/radrover-rad-power-bikes-integrated-battery-price"&gt;the flagship RadRover fat-tire bike&lt;/a&gt;. It shows how Rad Power Bikes is evolving as it settles into its position as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;the number one e-bike manufacturer in North America&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GOH9k5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new RadCity will climb hills 40 percent faster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="03jPyf"&gt;Rad Power Bikes says the new RadCity will climb hills 40 percent faster than the previous generation. The bike’s range has also been improved by 11 percent, thanks to custom-made tires that operate more efficiently on paved roads. But the range estimate is &lt;a href="https://electricbikereview.com/rad-power-bikes/radcity/"&gt;the same as the fourth-generation version of the bike&lt;/a&gt;, where, depending on your level of assist, Rad says you’ll get between 28–50 miles of range. And the stopping power has been improved with the inclusion of hydraulic disc brakes with long-lasting ceramic pads. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlsEiLA0Pek4gpEp7Jhz04d0ohk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867691/ahawkins_210914_4767_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dr2oYw"&gt;Last week, I got a chance to test out the new RadCity with Redwood Stephens, chief product officer at Rad Power Bikes. Before taking the bikes for a leisurely ride around Central Park, he told me how the company’s engineering team approached the challenge of squeezing more power out of the bike’s battery and motor. Much of what was accomplished derived was because of a successful pairing between the bike’s motor and its speed controller, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xljWyz"&gt;“Our engineering team has spent a lot of time dialing in on the user interface, the programming at each pedal assist level, the programming on the throttle, and really getting that controller-motor pairing to be ultra-efficient,” Stephens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nUrkgZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RadCity proves itself to be a fast, nimble, and effortlessly fun bike to ride&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JSLQ50"&gt;That efficiency shines through on the pavement, where the RadCity proves itself to be a fast, nimble, and effortlessly fun bike to ride. The motor is noticeably quieter than Rad’s older models, but it isn’t nearly silent like some of the newer Bosch motors tend to be. But the new geared hub motor (rated for 750W, like all of Rad’s bikes) has a lot more pick-me-up than the previous generation model’s gearless motors. Geared hub motors are slightly heavier than gearless motors, but not so much that you compromise on range. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RgYNbBAZcRxQu9jhpLv-kA7Mytg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867692/ahawkins_210914_4767_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UMrk2M"&gt;The cockpit of the bike is also redesigned, with two displays rather than just one. The square-shaped display in the center of the handlebars shows real-time stats, like speed, power output, and trip time. A smaller display on the left features a big orange power button and two even bigger up and down arrow buttons for toggling between power settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAN2d"&gt;Rather than integrate the wires in the frame of the bike, Rad is sticking with the rats nest look, which Stephens says helps with maintenance and repair issues. It can also be useful when selling the bike in markets with different regulations. For example, the throttle can be disconnected if the bike is sold in a country that prohibits throttles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNowpv"&gt;Speaking of different markets, the RadCity 5 Plus will be the commuter bike’s debut in the European market, where Rad has recently started selling its bikes. Europe is going to be a bigger focus for Rad Power Bikes, with the company seeing “triple-digit” sales growth there year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ZUB6h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10766131"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YI3rCK"&gt;The semi-integrated battery is still removable, which, in my opinion, is preferable compared to fully integrated, non-removable batteries. While some of the battery is still sticking out, it’s not as unsightly as the external batteries in Rad’s older models. And the ability to leave your heavy bike outside while you bring the battery indoors for charging can’t be underestimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92vlEQ"&gt;For the first time, the RadCity will be offered in two frame sizes: a high-step model and a step-through one. Being able to appeal to a wider range of riders — including older customers, people with knee issues, and others who would prefer not to have to swing their leg over a top tube — is key feature in the new RadCity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0kxaj"&gt;It’s exciting to see a company like Rad Power Bikes take what works about its bikes and make them better, while also introducing new ideas and new designs. Rad will need to continue to innovate as e-bike sales continue to grow, incumbent bike makers roll out their own designs, and rival direct-to-consumer brands release newer, more powerful bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BYxHx"&gt;There is a lot of money flowing into this space right now, and talk of tax breaks for consumers will certainly fuel even more hype and investment in the future. Rad Power Bikes has captured the top spot with a simple but well-designed lineup of powerful and affordable e-bikes. And with the new and improved RadCity, the company is proving that it’s not content to rest on its laurels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onmgkh"&gt;The RadCity 5 Plus is available for preorder online starting on September 22nd for the US price of $1,799, and it will be coming to Europe in the winter of 2021–2022 for €1,799.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRz1sLgtNeEgq2XaIUYSqOV0FuE=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892225/VRG_ILLO_4756_Student_Professor_Folders_Lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A generation that grew up with Google is forcing professors to rethink their lesson plans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1PTaTy"&gt;Catherine Garland, an astrophysicist, started seeing the problem in 2017. She was teaching an engineering course, and her students were using simulation software to model turbines for jet engines. She’d laid out the assignment clearly, but student after student was calling her over for help. They were all getting the same error message: The program couldn’t find their files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPxjeh"&gt;Garland thought it would be an easy fix. She asked each student where they’d saved their project. Could they be on the desktop? Perhaps in the shared drive? But over and over, she was met with confusion. “What are you talking about?” multiple students inquired. Not only did they not know where their files were saved — they didn’t understand the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhPrjh"&gt;Gradually, Garland came to the same realization that many of her fellow educators have reached in the past four years: the concept of file folders and directories, essential to previous generations’ understanding of computers, is gibberish to many modern students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FVR1bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I open a drawer, and inside that drawer, I have another cabinet with more drawers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LvQTA4"&gt;Professors have varied recollections of when they first saw the disconnect. But their estimates (even the most tentative ones) are surprisingly similar. It’s been an issue for four years or so, starting — for many educators — around the fall of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hP408s"&gt;That’s approximately when Lincoln Colling, a lecturer in the psychology department at the University of Sussex, told a class full of research students to pull a file out of a specific directory and was met with blank stares. It was the same semester that Nicolás Guarín-Zapata, an applied physicist and lecturer at Colombia’s Universidad EAFIT, noticed that students in his classes were having trouble finding their documents. It’s the same year that &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/3535/introducing-file-systems-to-students-who-really-dont-understand?noredirect=1&amp;amp;lq=1"&gt;posts began to pop up on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1"&gt;STEM-educator forums&lt;/a&gt; asking for help explaining the concept of a file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPGgHV"&gt;Guarín-Zapata is an organizer. He has an intricate hierarchy of file folders on his computer, and he sorts the photos on his smartphone by category. He was in college in the very early 2000s — he grew up needing to keep papers organized. Now, he thinks of his hard drives like filing cabinets. “I open a drawer, and inside that drawer, I have another cabinet with more drawers,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Like a nested structure. At the very end, I have a folder or a piece of paper I can access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pS7YVC"&gt;Guarín-Zapata’s mental model is commonly known as directory structure, the hierarchical system of folders that modern computer operating systems use to arrange files. It’s the idea that a modern computer doesn’t just save a file in an infinite expanse; it saves it in the “Downloads” folder, the “Desktop” folder, or the “Documents” folder, all of which live within “This PC,” and each of which might have folders nested within them, too. It’s an idea that’s likely intuitive to any computer user who remembers the floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIU14w"&gt;More broadly, directory structure connotes physical placement — the idea that a file stored on a computer is &lt;em&gt;located&lt;/em&gt; somewhere on that computer, in a specific and discrete location. That’s a concept that’s always felt obvious to Garland but seems completely alien to her students. “I tend to think an item lives in a particular folder. It lives in one place, and I have to go to that folder to find it,” Garland says. “They see it like one bucket, and everything’s in the bucket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DJXg5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“As much as I want them to be organized and try for them to be organized, it’s just a big hot mess.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp8s6S"&gt;That tracks with how Joshua Drossman, a senior at Princeton, has understood computer systems for as long as he can remember. “The most intuitive thing would be the laundry basket where you have everything kind of together, and you’re just kind of pulling out what you need at any given time,” he says, attempting to describe his mental model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXXkav"&gt;As an operations research and financial engineering major, Drossman knows how to program — he’s been trained to navigate directories and folders throughout his undergraduate years, and he understands their importance in his field. But it’s still not entirely natural, and he sometimes slips. About halfway through a recent nine-month research project, he’d built up so many files that he gave up on keeping them all structured. “I try to be organized, but there’s a certain point where there are so many files that it kind of just became a hot mess,” Drossman says. Many of his items ended up in one massive folder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCF1tz"&gt;Peter Plavchan, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at George Mason University, has seen similar behavior from his students and can’t quite wrap his head around it. “Students have had these computers in my lab; they’ll have a thousand files on their desktop completely unorganized,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, somewhat incredulously. “I’m kind of an obsessive organizer ... but they have no problem having 1,000 files in the same directory. And I think that is fundamentally because of a shift in how we access files.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR9cMa"&gt;Aubrey Vogel, a journalism major at Texas A&amp;amp;M, has had similar experiences to Drossman. She’s encountered directory structure before; she shared a computer with her grandfather, who showed her how to save items in folders, as a child. But as she’s grown up, she’s moved away from that system — she now keeps one massive directory for schoolwork and one for her job. Documents she’s not sure about go in a third folder called “Sort.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFii3X"&gt;“As much as I want them to be organized and try for them to be organized, it’s just a big hot mess,” Vogel says of her files. She adds, “My family always gives me a hard time when they see my computer screen, and it has like 50 thousand icons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Fl2oF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2017’s college freshmen were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; they’re around the same age as Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RltPyI"&gt;Why have mental models changed? Drossman, for his part, has no idea. “I don’t think I even thought about it at all when I first started using computers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrhK3S"&gt;It’s possible that the analogy multiple professors pointed to — filing cabinets — is no longer useful since many students Drossman’s age spent their high school years storing documents in the likes of OneDrive and Dropbox rather than in physical spaces. It could also have to do with the other software they’re accustomed to — dominant smartphone apps like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube all involve pulling content from a vast online sea rather than locating it within a nested hierarchy. “When I want to scroll over to Snapchat, Twitter, they’re not in any particular order, but I know exactly where they are,” says Vogel, who is a devoted iPhone user. Some of it boils down to muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mi34VS"&gt;But it may also be that in an age where every conceivable user interface includes a search function, young people have never needed folders or directories for the tasks they do. The first internet search engines were used &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/first-search-engine-archie"&gt;around 1990&lt;/a&gt;, but features like Windows Search and Spotlight on macOS are both products of the early 2000s. Most of 2017’s college freshmen were born in the very late ‘90s. They were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17823490/google-20th-birthday-anniversary-history-milestones"&gt;they’re around the same age as Google&lt;/a&gt;. While many of today’s professors grew up without search functions on their phones and computers, today’s students increasingly don’t remember a world without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsmw9E2CS-9tvAZd6Gf17RtlZmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864732/VRG_ILLO_4756_Student_Professor_Folders_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O6J7za"&gt;“I grew up when you had to have a file; you had to save it; you had to know where it was saved. There was no search function,” says Saavik Ford, a professor of astronomy at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. But among her students, “There’s not a conception that there’s a place where files live. They just search for it and bring it up.” She added, “They have a laundry basket full of laundry, and they have a robot who will fetch them every piece of clothing they want on demand.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171441/foldimate-laundry-folding-robot-ces-2019"&gt;Some companies&lt;/a&gt; have actually played around with laundry-inclined robots, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512529/laundroid-laundry-folding-robot-seven-dreamers-bankrupt-ces"&gt;to little result&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZOONb"&gt;To a point, the new mindset may reflect a natural — and expected — technological progression. Plavchan recalls having similar disconnects with his own professors. “When I was a student, I’m sure there was a professor that said, ‘Oh my god, I don’t understand how this person doesn’t know how to solder a chip on a motherboard,’” he says. “This kind of generational issue has always been around.” And though directory structures exist on every computer (as well as in environments like Google Drive), today’s iterations of macOS and Windows do an excellent job of hiding them. (Your Steam games all live in a folder called “steamapps” — when was the last time you clicked on that?) Today’s virtual world is largely a searchable one; people in many modern professions have little need to interact with nested hierarchies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ae1D8f"&gt;But in STEM fields, directory structure remains crucially important. Astronomers, for example, may work with hundreds of thousands of files in the same format — which can be unwieldy to scale to a searchable system, Plavchan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsQLiN"&gt;The primary issue is that the code researchers write, run at the command line, needs to be told exactly how to access the files it’s working with — it can’t search for those files on its own. Some programming languages have search functions, but they’re difficult to implement and not commonly used. It’s in the programming lessons where STEM professors, across fields, are encountering problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EMNMHJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They use a computer one way, and we use a computer another way. That’s where the problem is starting.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utahap"&gt;Classes in high school computer science — that is, programming — are &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-do-we-know-about-the-expansion-of-k-12-computer-science-education/"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; globally. But that hasn’t translated to better preparation for college coursework in every case. Guarín-Zapata was taught computer basics in high school — how to save, how to use file folders, how to navigate the terminal — which is knowledge many of his current students are coming in without. The high school students Garland works with largely haven’t encountered directory structure unless they’ve taken upper-level STEM courses. Vogel recalls saving to file folders in a first-grade computer class, but says she was never directly taught what folders were — those sorts of lessons have taken a backseat amid a growing emphasis on&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/keyword/21st-century+Skills"&gt; “21st-century skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745499919829214"&gt;”&lt;/a&gt; in the educational space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlPFtO"&gt;A cynic could blame generational incompetence. An &lt;a href="https://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/2020-04/IEA%20International%20Computer%20and%20Information%20Literacy%20Study%202018%20International%20Report.pdf"&gt;international 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that measured eighth-graders’ “capacities to use information and computer technologies productively” proclaimed that just 2 percent of Gen Z had achieved the highest “digital native” tier of computer literacy. “Our students are in deep trouble,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/16/todays-kids-may-be-digital-natives-new-study-shows-they-arent-close-being-computer-literate/"&gt;one educator wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XFaf2"&gt;But the issue is likely not that modern students are learning fewer digital skills, but rather that they’re learning different ones. Guarín-Zapata, for all his knowledge of directory structure, doesn’t understand Instagram nearly as well as his students do, despite having had an account for a year. He’s had students try to explain the app in detail, but “I still can’t figure it out,” he complains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vo2NuV"&gt;“They use a computer one way, and we use a computer another way,” Guarin-Zapata emphasizes. “That’s where the problem is starting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZMsRb"&gt;Ford agrees. “These are smart kids,” she says. “They’re doing astrophysics. They get stuff. But they were not getting this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni92sJ"&gt;Regardless of source, the consequence is clear. STEM educators are increasingly taking on dual roles: those of instructors not only in their field of expertise but in computer fundamentals as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqbHXN"&gt;Colling’s courses now include a full two-hour lecture to explain directory structure. He likens finding files to giving driving directions. He shows maps of directory trees and asks his students to pretend they’re guiding others to a highlighted point. He uses every analogy he can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Ix4AAS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Take their phones away and get ‘em on Windows 98.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wEtYGX"&gt;Plavchan now also spends a lot of time teaching his students about directory structure in his courses, along with other basics, like file extensions and terminal navigation. Guarín-Zapata begins his semesters with a similar tutorial. “I start with a little talk about a mental model of a computer, what a computer is,” he says. “We have memory; we have a hard drive; we have an interface; we have a file structure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Z1q5Z"&gt;It’s a difficult concept to get across, though. Directory structure isn’t just unintuitive to students — it’s &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; intuitive to professors that they have difficulty figuring out how to explain it. “Those of us who have been around a while &lt;em&gt;know &lt;/em&gt;what a file is, but I was at a bit of a loss to explain it,” lamented one educator in &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1"&gt;a 2019 forum post&lt;/a&gt;, a sentiment that respondents shared. Ford put out a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saavikford/status/1425235203308535808"&gt;call for useful analogies&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and was met with various suggestions: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PrieneV/status/1425442829598445569"&gt;physical tree branches and leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/akiroberge/status/1425494357600317448"&gt;kitchen utensils sorted into drawers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markmadsen/status/1425502956825178115"&gt;books and shelves in a library&lt;/a&gt;, “Take their phones away and get ‘em on Windows 98.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYm0l0"&gt;But even after presenting students with every metaphor in the books, Colling still isn’t positive that his students get what he’s talking about: “It feels like I’m having some success, but yeah, sometimes it’s hard to tell,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCke1I"&gt;Plavchan agrees that there are limits to how much he can bridge the generational divide. Despite his efforts to tailor his teaching, “some of the tools we use rely on some knowledge that our students just aren’t getting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVJ4Sq"&gt;Others, meanwhile, believe it’s professors who need to adjust their thinking. Working with befuddled students has convinced Garland that the “laundry basket” may be a superior model. She’s begun to see the limitations of directory structure in her personal life; she uses her computer’s search function to find her schedules and documents when she’s lost them in her stack of directories. “I’m like, huh ... I don’t even need these subfolders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l72n7v"&gt;Even professors who have incorporated directory structure into their courses suspect that they may be clinging to an approach that’s soon to be obsolete. Plavchan has considered offering a separate course on directory structure — but he’s not sure it’s worth it. “I imagine what’s going to happen is our generation of students ... they’re going to grow up and become professors, they’re going to write their own tools, and they’re going to be based on a completely different approach from what we use today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DeTDMa"&gt;His advice to fellow educators: Get ready. “This is not gonna go away,” he says. “You’re not gonna go back to the way things were. You have to accept it. The sooner that you accept that things change, the better.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new 11-inch tablet has a flipping webcam  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kt0pm1ihneDs4kgB6RT0N8hyXkU=/0x0:1879x1253/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892207/HP_11_inch_Tablet_PC_4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP’s 11-inch tablet also includes stylus support.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqfoqT"&gt;HP has announced a new 11-inch tablet that appears to be a more or less direct competitor to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt;, with a couple of interesting tricks. For starters, its 13-megapixel rear facing camera can flip around the short edge of the display to work as a webcam, which HP claims is a first for a tablet, and also makes it the highest resolution front-facing camera to boot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrUyLM"&gt;It’s also able to work with its keyboard accessory in either portrait or landscape modes: Handy, since in landscape mode its webcam is on the wrong edge of its 2160 x 1440 IPS display. As well as the keyboard, the tablet also works with HP’s Tilt Pen, and there’s a USB-C port for plugging in more accessories as well as charging, alongside a microSD card slot and a fingerprint reader built into its power button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EuGa-rsxSnIyTnpvvlqyUDRItZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869417/HP_11_inch_Tablet_PC_7.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13-megapixel sensor works as either a webcam or a rear-facing camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjSuPhL4xnC6gv1_WNU8jCyq32o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869418/HP_11_inch_Tablet_PC_TwillGray_Portrait_T_HDcam_nonODD_nonFPR_Win11_CoreSet_FrontRight.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet in portrait mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nlBtCd"&gt;Internally, the tablet is available with an Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of NVMe storage. Its modest specs mean that it’s running Windows 11’s lightweight S mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkw3Dp"&gt;HP plans to eventually sell the tablet both with and without the keyboard when it goes on sale in December. It’ll start at $499 alone, or $599 with the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Microsoft’s Surface event today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8CAc52AX9dhUytzuOgLyInbrUyo=/200x0:2333x1422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892135/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_3.48.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sfr0cq"&gt;Microsoft is holding an online hardware event on Wednesday, September 22nd, at 11AM ET / 8AM PT, where it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;expected to announce&lt;/a&gt; redesigned Surface tablets and laptops (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;potentially a new phone&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will be covering any announcements from the event and running a world-class live blog, and here’s how you can watch along with us, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKM4HQ"&gt;It’s simple: Microsoft will have a livestream &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the events page of its website&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll also be able to watch it on on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/surface/status/1435618941473148938"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. You can follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;@verge on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to see news from the event as it happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIayK4"&gt;Looming over the event is the upcoming release of Windows 11, which will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;coming out on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s almost a given that anything Microsoft announces at Wednesday’s event will be running the new OS, it will be interesting if the rumors about Microsoft releasing a new version of its Arm-based Surface Pro X tablet are true. We don’t have a very clear picture of how Windows 11 will pair with Microsoft’s long-running Arm computing ambitions — and a new computer, perhaps one with a new Microsoft-designed chip, could be a great time for the company to talk about the future of Windows outside of Intel, AMD, and x86 in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmbhw0"&gt;There are also likely to be some traditional x86 computers shown off at the event, with rumors suggesting that we’ll see a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 tablet&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-book-4"&gt;Surface Book laptop&lt;/a&gt;, and an updated &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-go-3"&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683595/microsoft-surface-duo-2-fcc-5g-nfc-wireless-charging-support-features"&gt;the real possibility&lt;/a&gt; we’ll see a follow-up to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo folding phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kh4Oxo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Surface event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VCm1Z5"&gt;But, if you're listening, Microsoft, I’d really like to see a version of the beautiful &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-ergonomic-keyboard%2F90pnc9ljwpx9%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Ergonomic Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, this time one without a number pad to get in the way of mousing. Your other keyboard, the Sculpt Ergonomic, is just not terribly well-built, and I’d prefer Bluetooth to a USB dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5e9Ep"&gt;To see the news as it happens on Wednesday morning, stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and head to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s website to see the stream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gitamini is a cute, compact, cargo-carrying robot that will follow you around like a dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXy-B0D4yQrpZ6xzLmPPBma6J-8=/0x0:6582x4388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892140/459_GitaStudio_Lifestyles_167_edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gitamini uses machine vision and AI to follow its owner. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Piaggio Fast Forward&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4avhGt"&gt;Piaggio Fast Forward, a subsidiary of storied Italian automotive firm Piaggio, has launched its second robot, a compact version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20897348/piaggio-vespa-gita-cargo-robot"&gt;cargo-carrying bot Gita&lt;/a&gt; named Gitamini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge34FS"&gt;The form and function of Gitamini remain the same as that of full-sized Gita (the name is Italian for a small trip or outing). The robot consists of two large wheels, a central trunk, and a machine vision system that it uses to identify and follow its owner. Gitamini weighs 28 pounds and can carry up to 20 pounds in its interior for 21 miles. That makes an interesting comparison to Gita, which can carry more — 40 pounds but only for 12 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5QaSJ"&gt;Gitamini uses an array of cameras and sensors, including radar (not available for the original Gita), to navigate and follow its user. To activate this follow mode, you simply stand in front of the Gitamini and tap a pairing button. The robot will then lock on to you using vision only (no GPS or Bluetooth are utilized) and will follow you at speeds of up to 6mph. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-uTgPX9oYxBqARsdC1emn5ymR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22867230/459_GitaStudio_Lifestyles_31_edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Piaggio Fast Forward&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Gita (left) and new Gitamini (right). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0G0KYl"&gt;The robot’s trunk can be locked and its follow mode disabled, but there are no active theft mitigation features. When asked about this, Piaggio Fast Forward’s CEO Greg Lynn told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “unlikely someone could get away with walking away with it unnoticed” as it’s such a noticeable object. “A stolen Gita isn’t of much use to anyone as it uses a secure connection to a phone to be unlocked, updated, and used,” says Lynn. “We have yet to learn of a Gita being stolen or broken into while being used or when parked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r5lAd"&gt;The Gita has always been a bit of an odd product. It certainly looks fantastic, and videos &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2DaDnC-uhHM"&gt;suggest it works more or less as advertised&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s noisier than you might expect). But it’s not clear exactly who’s going to spend thousands of dollars on something that only carries a few bags and is stymied by steps and stairs. Gitamini doesn’t change any of these basic annoyances, though it is at least a little cheaper — it costs $1,850 (and will be available to buy from October 15th at &lt;a href="http://mygita.com/"&gt;mygita.com&lt;/a&gt;) while the launch sees the price of the original Gita drop to $2,950. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vndv3Y"&gt;When we asked CEO Greg Lynn about the robot, he declined to share any sales figures with us but said there were Gita robots operating in “half the states in the US [...] with a focus on the Southern belt where outdoor weather is more friendly year-round.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgoVg3"&gt;“Most of the consumer Gitas are being used to replace car trips for neighborhood errands in a variety of communities, and they are used outdoors for round trips of a mile or more,” said Lynn. Though, he noted that the company had some business customers, too. There are currently Gitas in eight airports in the US (including JFK and LAX) and a number more in planned communities, like Water Street Tampa in Florida and Ontario Ranch in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5BXN2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber thinks it could actually turn a profit this quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mm0wObFy_epb8ZP6MauhmFwuXc8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69892062/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0CwRU"&gt;Uber says it may be profitable this quarter for the first time in its history. The disclosure came in a &lt;a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001552781-21-000710/0001552781-21-000710.txt"&gt;new filing&lt;/a&gt; made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Whereas the company previously expected to make a net loss of under $100 million, it now believes it could make an adjusted profit of up to $25 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkYFYc"&gt;“We believe Uber is now tracking towards Adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] breakeven in Q3, well ahead of our prior guidance,” said the company’s CFO, Nelson Chai, in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnKb4N"&gt;In a worst case scenario, the company cautions that it could still make a loss of $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6O7GBa"&gt;However, criticism has been levelled at the way Uber calculated its adjusted profits. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/uber-says-its-on-track-to-maybe-make-a-fake-profit-1847716786"&gt;G&lt;em&gt;izmodo &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s definition of EBITDA includes an unusually large list of exclusions, and argues it’s not an accurate measure of the company’s overall profitability. Nevertheless, Uber shareholders were pleased, with the stock closing up 11 percent on the updated forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NY6RNH"&gt;“They say that crisis breeds opportunity and that’s certainly been true of Uber during the last 18 months,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, adding that the quarter could prove to be an “important milestone” for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X9DnS1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They say that crisis breeds opportunity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psvvzL"&gt;It would certainly be an important milestone for Khosrowshahi, who took over as CEO in 2017, and has steered the company through a pandemic that rocked its core ride-hailing business as people drastically cut back on their travel. In May last year the company reported that its ride-hailing business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251111/uber-q1-earnings-rides-loss-eats-delivery-coronavirus"&gt;suffered an 80 percent drop&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to a $2.9 billion quarterly loss for the company. In response, Khosrowshahi laid off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262337/uber-layoff-3000-employees-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859413/uber-job-layoffs-announcement-engineering-product-profit"&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;. Uber also sold off its self-driving car unit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;at the end of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gJEBt"&gt;However, with the easing of lockdown restrictions around the world, demand for Uber’s ride-hailing business has started to recover, resulting in an acute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;driver shortage&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Meanwhile, the company’s food-delivery business, while still unprofitable overall, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/05/uber-earnings-food-delivery-revenue"&gt;boomed over the course of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EhQMV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-says-it-will-post-its-first-adjusted-profit-11632220496"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Uber has posted a rare net profit in the past due to one-time investments and divestitures, but this could be the first time its core operations turn a net profit since its founding over a decade ago. A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df377e2b-6e3a-445a-b8d7-1c29d170a2fd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; report from June&lt;/a&gt; said that Uber’s total losses since its founding in 2009 measured over $22 billion. Its main US rival, Lyft, posted an adjusted profit in the second quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4h7URS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Need to trap a Roomba? You don’t need anything more sophisticated than a rug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGokXA-X3tb2MmVPlVoRUp9d6N4=/0x127:3000x2127/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69891976/Roomba_980_wall_follow.0.0.1442365225.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A6rB7j"&gt;iRobot recently launched a new robot vacuum cleaner that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price"&gt;uses AI to avoid dog poop&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s Roombas have long struggled with a more basic problem: confusing dark patterns on carpets and rugs for perilous drops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qteOu"&gt;A video &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DimaKrotov/status/1436150021792149506"&gt;recently shared on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by IBM researcher Dmitry Krotov shows exactly the problem: a Roomba rolling around inside a rectangular box pattern on a rug, refusing to drive over the lines as if were physical walls. Usually, iRobot’s software flags this sort of problem as a dangerous “cliff,” and a quick search on Twitter for “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=roomba%20rug%20cliff&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;roomba rug cliff&lt;/a&gt;” shows it’s a pretty common error. As one user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jamester74/status/1267074557778722817"&gt;complains&lt;/a&gt;: “I swear that Robby the Roomba is a right drama queen!! This is NOT a cliff Robby. It’s a rug!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CmKY6"&gt;The actual mechanics behind this error are pretty fascinating, though. And it has nothing to do with machine learning, but rather the cost constraints on the robot vacuums’ hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qMpBq"&gt;As iRobot research scientist Ben Kehoe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe/status/1440355689830838280"&gt;explained in response&lt;/a&gt; to Krotov’s video, the basic problem is that Roombas detect sudden drops like stairs and steps using a combination of an LED and a photodiode — a sensor that detects light. As Kehoe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe/status/1440362451095068672"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;: “Does the photodiode detect reflected light from the LED? Great, the floor is there! No reflected light? Uh oh, that must be a cliff. Dark black carpet-&amp;gt;no reflected light, it looks like a cliff!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URzAK7"&gt;The problem, notes Kehoe, is balancing the accuracy of the Roomba’s sensors while keeping unit costs low. “Our newer models don’t suffer from this, but it took YEARS to figure out how to make the sensor robust to this while remaining cost effective,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ben11kehoe/status/1440355689830838280"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix makes its biggest acquisition ever — the Roald Dahl catalog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q0Q6WAWoZOdi0eRhr1bmOt0bZ1Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69890125/RD_NETFLIX_LH_V009__0_00_07_21_20181127_5885_fizs41.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqxhXv"&gt;Nearly three years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114572/netflix-animated-adaptations-willy-wonka-matilda-bfg-roald-dahl-books"&gt;Netflix signed a deal with The Roald Dahl Story Company&lt;/a&gt; to create a universe of animated features based on the author’s books, the company has acquired the works outright. &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-acquires-iconic-roald-dahl-story-company"&gt;Netflix made the deal official&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday after news of the impending acquisition was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/netflix-is-said-to-be-nearing-deal-to-buy-roald-dahl-catalog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8zHLF"&gt;There’s no word on exactly how much it costs to own Willy Wonka, the BFG, Matilda, and all the rest, but in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflixs-roald-dahl-deal-could-create-tv-universe-1164419/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter &lt;/em&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; sources claiming that simply licensing 16 titles from the catalog cost Netflix more than $100 million. A deal for this catalog would likely rank as Netflix’s largest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Vmd8w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reed Hastings and the Giant Acquisition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OB1nK0"&gt;Under the previous deal, Taika Waititi is &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/taika-waititi-netflix-charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory-animated-series-willy-wonka-oompa-loompa-1203524577/"&gt;working on Roald Dahl animated series projects for Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, covering &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory &lt;/em&gt;and its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&lt;/em&gt;. That’s in addition to two different versions of Matilda, including a film version of &lt;em&gt;Matilda the Musical&lt;/em&gt; and an animated series, plus plans to make a&lt;em&gt; The BFG&lt;/em&gt; cartoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFTybM"&gt;Netflix now plans to bring the collection to more audiences in new formats. “These projects opened our eyes to a much more ambitious venture,” said the streaming company in a press release. “The creation of a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9mWcX"&gt;Prior to the deal’s announcement, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;noted that it would happen despite the shadow cast by Dahl’s history of antisemitic statements and sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2018/11/i-d-still-read-roald-dahl-s-books-my-children-we-can-t-forget-he-was-anti-semite"&gt;misogynistic storytelling&lt;/a&gt;. The Dahl Family and the Roald Dahl Story Company &lt;a href="https://www.roalddahl.com/global/rdsc-and-family-notice"&gt;released an apology&lt;/a&gt; for the remarks in 2020, saying, “We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LD482v"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: The Verge is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bei4u7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 22nd, 3:40AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story updated with confirmation of the acquisition and relevant quotes from press release.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15.1’s first beta suggests we could see SharePlay soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YnyT9jGz12swQUpHyi1jxKduWE=/13x0:2032x1346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69891587/D3743FFE_9B62_4074_ADC3_50C2232BB74A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h4zR8p"&gt;SharePlay has returned in the iOS 15.1 beta, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-1-beta-1-re-enables-shareplay-feature-following-delay/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple delayed the major iOS 15 feature&lt;/a&gt; to “later this fall” instead of having it launch alongside the OS upgrade as planned. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;not the only feature&lt;/a&gt; that’s hasn’t made it to release yet, but it could be a useful one during the ongoing pandemic — it lets you watch videos, screen share, or listen to music with other people over a FaceTime call. Its existence in Tuesday’s new beta could indicate that it could be coming sooner than later, though that’s not a sure thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIWUKs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 15.1 beta also lets users add their COVID vaccine card to the Wallet app, once you’ve first added it to Health. Similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558245/google-pay-covid-vaccination-card-android-digital-pass"&gt;Google’s version of this feature works&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to get your vaccine info from your medical provider or your state’s healthcare system before you can add it to your phone. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=7h3vwlh5"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; the feature uses the SMART Health Card format, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.commontrustnetwork.org/verifier-list"&gt;supported by a handful of states and some major vaccination providers&lt;/a&gt;. The list includes states like California, Hawaii, New York, and Louisiana, as well as pharmacy providers like CVS, Rite Aid, and Walmart, but you can click the link for the full details. As always, check with your local healthcare provider for more info.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBb0fAMdqijdEosAZ6EFa_PFPzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868514/2048.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add verified vaccine records from certain health providers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gO6R9t"&gt;These features showing up in the iOS 15.1 beta don’t necessarily mean they’ll be in the final iOS 15.1 release — after all, SharePlay was introduced during the iOS 15 beta, but was later removed. However, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F21%2F22686897%2Fios-15-1-beta-shareplay-feature-announced-removed-coming-soon-vaccine-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does still say&lt;/a&gt; that SharePlay will ship “later this fall,” and there’s only so much time left for that (plus, it would be a bit odd if it was removed from &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; beta). The vaccine card feature will be included in an “upcoming software update,” according to the company, so it’s possible it’s further out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdzwDB"&gt;It also may be a bit before we see iOS 15.1, given that iOS 15 was just released yesterday (iOS 14.1 &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;came about a month after&lt;/a&gt; iOS 14). But if this early beta is any indication, it could be bringing some nice new features with it when it does show up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first patient testimony about a Theranos test result: a miscarriage that wasn’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elizabeth Holmes Theranos Trial Continues In California" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4XCIP1egTfv2lejhSiPtn2oGIE=/0x0:4502x3001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69891173/1340934529.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘You can’t provide accurate patient care with inaccurate results.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eY0C0L"&gt;Brittany Gould, wearing a black mask with a clear window through which you could see her mouth, got choked up as she told the court about her experience with Theranos in 2014. She’d used the company’s tests because they were cheap — her language was “cost-effective” — and the results told her, wrongly, that she was miscarrying. It would have been her fourth miscarriage in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dolu6h"&gt;The defense in US v. Elizabeth Holmes blocked testimony from Gould about the emotional impact of the bad test, so jurors didn’t hear how it affected her. But “the loss of all these babies and pregnancies, and going through the experience of thinking I’m losing another one, is a lot,” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-patients-the-emerging-wild-card-in-the-trial-of-elizabeth-holmes-11627915111"&gt;Gould told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview before the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQ8mCL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The experience was unremarkable — until the wrong result came back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFDfIp"&gt;Gould’s bad results are the first real-world example of how Theranos’ tests affected patients. So far we’ve heard from employees about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;bad labs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;inaccurate results&lt;/a&gt; — but we haven’t seen ordinary people whose lives have been affected by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYO57h"&gt;Gould is among the patients that the government will call to testify against Holmes, who is facing 10 counts of wire fraud and two of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. But it’s hard to know exactly how many patients received bad results. Though there was a company database of millions of results, it was encrypted and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-theranos-database-is-useless-what-happened-11614205525"&gt;the government didn’t get the password to it&lt;/a&gt;; the original version of the database has been destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VziAKv"&gt;Gould went to Walgreens, which hosted Theranos wellness centers, and “got my finger poked,” she testified. Besides the finger stick test, the experience was unremarkable — until the wrong result came back. Her nurse practitioner called Gould, and had to give her the bad news that it looked like she was miscarrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nv94ry"&gt;Though Gould’s moment on the stand was brief, her nurse practitioner, Audra Zachman, testified at more length. Zachman had received Theranos’ promotional materials at her practice, Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care. Theranos was “very exciting” when she first heard about it, especially since the company offered to install a lab below one of the practice’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SN1AQK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Such a red flag.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c7dxeL"&gt;Gould’s previous miscarriages meant her pregnancy was considered high-risk, so Zachman ordered tests for hCG, an important hormone in pregnancy. In a normal pregnancy, its value doubles every 48 to 72 hours, Zachman said. Gould first took a test from Quest on September 30th, 2014, with a value of 1,005. Then, on October 2nd, a Theranos test showed her levels had jumped to 12,558; on October 4th, another Theranos test showed those values had plummeted to 125.58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ok80Zd"&gt;While Zachman told Gould the test values suggested a miscarriage, she also told Gould to keep taking her prenatal vitamins and to get another test. This test, from Quest, on October 6th, showed results consistent with a normal pregnancy. So did the next value from Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPpovl"&gt;Those results “stood out as such a red flag” about Theranos, Zachman said. She’d never seen anything like the results Gould received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jq3Pc9"&gt;Zachman complained to Theranos, and apparently corresponded with Holmes’ brother, Christian. He blamed the data entry process, not the test. But the corrected values were still concerning, since they were the same as the October 2nd results. Usually, when hGC doesn’t go up, that indicates an ectopic pregnancy, where the fetus has implanted outside the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxT7W3"&gt;Because Zachman didn’t receive an explanation that satisfied her from Theranos, she stopped referring patients there. Still, she kept getting results from Theranos because her patients brought them in; they didn’t need a doctor’s order to get a blood draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xRTKAg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t provide accurate patient care with inaccurate results.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zdJsxG"&gt;On cross-examination, Zachman testified to a number of corrective measures Theranos offered — which made the company sound like one of those Amazon sellers that begs you to remove your bad review. See, Zachman sat on the Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care board that evaluated new products. So Theranos offered to run, and did run, a study in 30 people comparing its results to those of Quest and a third party lab. Christian Holmes offered her his private email address and phone number. She was also offered a meeting with Elizabeth Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xQTM7"&gt;When the results came back from Theranos’ study, conducted with her employer, Zachman still didn’t refer patients to Theranos and says her colleagues largely didn’t either. The experience with Gould was so jarring to her — both as a healthcare provider and as a woman, she said — that the study couldn’t convince her to use the tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFOsIq"&gt;Gould didn’t use Theranos again, either. “You can’t provide accurate patient care with inaccurate results,” she said on the stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyVCpQ"&gt;But between October 2015 and October 2016, Theranos did another 300 hCG tests for patients at Southwest Contemporary Women’s Care, according to evidence from the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dr1QBn"&gt;Obviously, the goal was to blunt the impact of Zachman’s testimony; the defense did not question Gould. The question the defense wanted the jurors to ask themselves, it seemed, was: “Would Theranos go above and beyond — with the study and so on — if it were really a fraud?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dRruj4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These documents were also used to point the finger at the lab directors &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXb5Tm"&gt;The morning’s testimony was in a similar vein: Surekha Gangakhedkar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;who’d formerly developed tests at Theranos&lt;/a&gt; and quit over her concerns about bringing those tests to patients, was cross-examined. First, the defense tried to establish that she’d done real, good work with drug companies Centocor and Celgene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nghfD"&gt;The defense also showed emails from Holmes congratulating Gangakhedkar on her work, one of which came at 12:20AM on a Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5LE5B"&gt;Then, to show that Theranos had taken its tests seriously, a number of documents were introduced that Gangakhedkar had signed off on. These reports detailed how the tests had been developed, and were voluminous. But those documents aren’t the same thing as what’s required to get approval for testing in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoYb8W"&gt;These documents were also used to point the finger at the lab directors as being ultimately responsible for the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="M2RVKy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes was presented as the “good boss”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2Pj71"&gt;With Gangakhedkar, as with Zachman, Holmes was presented as the “good boss” who just wanted to get things right. It wasn’t just the kudos emails. Holmes approved a month-long vacation so Gangakhedkar could take her family to meet extended family in India. And when Gangakhedkar quit, Holmes tried to talk her out of it. Holmes offered a leave of absence, and asked if there was anything else she could do to make Gangakhedkar stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRwzuh"&gt;Balwani, by contrast, was painted as the “bad boss,” who had repeatedly downplayed Gangakhedkar’s team’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH7UwO"&gt;The testimony from Zachman and Gangakhedkar felt similar — when something went wrong, Theranos or Holmes tried to fix it. But one thing stood out: Gould didn’t have a similar story. &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; was the one most affected by the bad test results, not Zachman. And Theranos knew the bad results belonged to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uwSold"&gt;While Zachman was offered Christian Holmes’ phone number and a meeting with Elizabeth Holmes, Gould didn’t testify to anything similar. Maybe she just wasn’t important enough for Theranos to want to win over. After all, she was just a patient.&lt;/p&gt;
