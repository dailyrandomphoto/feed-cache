    <title>Leaked Resident Evil 4 VR video suggests free Mercenaries DLC will arrive in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9WAIe1OjQpnde1yhki3eyfgZF8=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70173691/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iRZ0t0"&gt;A leaked video suggests that &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; may be getting a free update that adds &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; mode in 2022, first spotted by &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/resident-evil-4-vr-mercenaries-mode-confirmed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxrTfC"&gt;According to the report, a trailer for the highly-requested &lt;em&gt;Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; mode briefly appeared on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/oculusvr"&gt;Oculus YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; before getting taken down. However, users still managed to save the trailer and repost it on YouTube. The leaked trailer says that &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; DLC is “arriving in 2022” as a “free update on Meta Quest 2.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6bsUB"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/qcs0nw/mercenaries_would_add_a_lot_of_replayability_to/"&gt;fans of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/qc8ar6/resident_evil_4_vr_will_not_have_mercenaries_mode/"&gt;the series&lt;/a&gt; were disappointed to find out that &lt;em&gt;Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t included in &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;, which challenges you to kill hordes of enemies and rack up as many points as possible before the timer runs out. As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; mode has been present in all versions of &lt;em&gt;RE4 — &lt;/em&gt;except for &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;. You could also find the mode in &lt;em&gt;RE3: Nemesis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;RE5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;RE6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;RE Village&lt;/em&gt;, and in its own spinoff &lt;em&gt;RE: The Mercenaries 3D&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DdiKAS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 will soon be known as the Meta Quest 2&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vF0kIJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22692268/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RE4&lt;/em&gt;VR came out on the Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; last month without the add-ons that the game came with in the past, including &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Separate Ways&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assignment: Ada&lt;/em&gt;. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review"&gt;review of the &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives you a better look at how the base game plays, which turned out to be better than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnEeC7"&gt;As you can also see from the leaked trailer, Facebook (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;which now belongs to Meta&lt;/a&gt;), has replaced the “Oculus Quest 2” with its revamped name and logo, calling it the “Meta Quest 2.” The rebranding has even seeped to the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus website&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll see Meta’s name and logo stamped in the top left corner of the screen (via &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-brand-dead-oculus-quest-to-become-meta-quest/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;Meta plans on phasing out Oculus branding&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, just in time for &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt;’ potential release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Reddit helped keep the Cowboy Bebop community alive </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzdMLbKio0tX2ifpm9b70eFQ9vA=/0x3:1504x1006/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70173647/CBP_e001_0239_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sunrise Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sum27A"&gt;In recent years, Netflix has started to specialize in live-action adaptations of anime. So far, the streaming service has released film adaptations such as &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rurouni Kenshin&lt;/em&gt;. The next anime to receive the live-action treatment is &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, a show considered to be one of the greatest anime ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1y4Zp"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; anime ended in 2001, but it’s seeing a surge in popularity thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"&gt;the new Netflix show&lt;/a&gt;. That popularity can be seen on Reddit in the r/cowboybebop subreddit. For nearly a decade, fans have flocked to this community to post their thoughts on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/mz1owa/spike_spiegel_seeing_his_past_with_his_left_eye/"&gt;Spike Spiegel and his past&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/lg2w9a/best_dub_ever/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;funny memes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/qn2tfx/my_faye_valentine_cosplay/"&gt;cosplay pics&lt;/a&gt;, and fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/qo78te/some_fan_art_i_drew/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;fan art&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JenAyb"&gt;“I created the subreddit in 2012, so a little over nine years now,” said MarshallBanana_, head moderator and creator of the subreddit. MarshallBanana_ became a fan during the series’ original run on Adult Swim. Anime gained popularity in America during the 1990s and the 2000s with the introduction of Toonami and Adult Swim, programming blocks on Cartoon Network dedicated to airing anime and mature shows. The first anime to ever air on Adult Swim was &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8L8xZL"&gt;The show made its debut on September 2nd, 2001, one day after the first broadcast of Adult Swim. It followed the adventures of Spike Spiegel, Jett Black, and Faye Valentine, bounty hunters who travel the galaxy searching for their targets. It only had 26 episodes and a movie but managed to maintain a huge online fanbase in the two decades following its release, thanks to communities like r/cowboybebop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfD0R5"&gt;Both the community, and the show it’s based on, have been able to reach and connect fans across the world. That includes one of the subreddit’s own moderators. Alwaqas is from the Middle East and joined the subreddit two years ago but has been a fan of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; since he was a kid. “Being from the Middle East, the anime that I watched as a kid were very different than what is popular in the US. One day, the&lt;em&gt; Bebop&lt;/em&gt; movie came up on TV, and I had heard about &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; before but never seen it; it was so different from what I have seen before, and I instantly got hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYc3_uLRXUHX5DU_KrsKsXx3JBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027107/CBP_e008_0120.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sunrise Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVVW6H"&gt;The show pulls from so many influences that it’s able to attract an international audience. “I think that the unique way that &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; blends genres while still being so consistent lets it feel so fresh to this day,” Alwaqas says. “It is still a really relevant show with a quality of animation that is still unmatched to this day.” SonicFrost, another moderator of the subreddit, explains that [it] has simply become necessary viewing for any prospective anime viewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsAnH9"&gt;Currently, the member count of r/cowboybebop sits at 225,000, but this was not always the case. “In 2018, the sub was barely stepping above 20,000 subs; it was pretty much dead at that point,” said -WakaJawaka-, one of the subreddit’s other moderators. These numbers improved after some of the mods attempted to revitalize the community, led by -WakaJawaka- and MarshallBanana_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZMiwUA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was pretty much dead at that point”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3gVVY"&gt;“I think after I joined, we tried to give it some life again with some small redesign, a new series rewatch discussion, and creating our Discord server, which gave a new breath of life into the community,” said -WakaJawaka-. The community’s members grew to 50,000 in 2019, likely thanks to these changes by the mods. SonicFrost believes that the community’s current growth has been sparked by the Netflix series. “Generally, I think that the fanbase will continue to grow just off the back of the original show,” he says. “But without a doubt, the announcement of the live-action show has had a significant effect on our subreddit, and we’re quite excited to see it breathe new life to it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPdPID"&gt;Users of r/cowboybebop have different theories. No_Mathematician2251 believes that YouTube video essays are the cause for this growth, while NChamars believes the answer is much simpler: the show is popular. “It’s because the series is gaining its spot in mainstream culture and over the years has been getting more attention. That’s why Netflix wants to create a live-action show.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nzmt7VvTK0c4-pjfPdXaVM8xUDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006585/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n314qk"&gt;MarshallBanana_ is optimistic about the Netflix series but does admit there’s been negativity surrounding it. “Lately, a good portion of the community has allowed for their more negative side to come out, as they feel very protective of the anime, and sometimes it bums me out that more people aren’t open-minded about the adaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7zKj1"&gt;With the Netflix show being a subject of controversy, criticism was always bound to happen. The negative commentary hasn’t been too common on the subreddit, stemming mostly from a vocal minority, but it has still been disappointing for SonicFrost. “It’s frustrating to see people who actively attempt to undermine and disqualify other people’s joy — as though their subjective feelings are objectively wrong. Isn’t that strange?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI6UGX"&gt;He also wants to give this vocal minority and all of the subreddit’s users a space to debate each other. “Our hope is both can find a voice on our platform, without resorting to tired insults and attacks on each other or on the cast and crew, who I’m certain have poured their heart and soul into this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UnjJEt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is such a warm and welcoming community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDXm9G"&gt;These conversations between users are among MarshallBanana_’s favorite aspects of the community. “For the most part, the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; community is filled with talented, kind, intelligent people. There’s always an enlightening conversation to be had and fan art projects and cosplay to admire.” For Alwaqas, his favorite aspect is how welcoming the community is. “It is such a warm and welcoming community; like every community, it has gatekeepers and not so nice members, but I never felt so welcomed in such a fanbase like the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; fanbase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4lGG9"&gt;After the Netflix show debuts, the subreddit will no doubt grow larger, meaning even more people will get to experience how this welcoming feeling. As for the community’s future, MarshallBanana_ thinks that the Netflix show will be the topic of conversation for a while. But when that passes, he has a few things in mind. “My personal goal is to keep the community civil and peaceful, have good conversations, and hopefully get some AMAs with people who worked on both shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ifOQP"&gt;The other mods echoed the same sentiment. There seems to be an expectation that the Netflix show will bring in new users. SonicFrost knows this, but he hopes that the series is actually good. “Netflix really has the opportunity here to reinvigorate this fandom — and maybe finally show that a ‘Netflix anime adaptation’ isn’t a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZB4STW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s early Black Friday deals on games and consoles have begun</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwlpf2"&gt;Nintendo’s early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals kicked off on Sunday, November 21st, and they’ll last until November 27th. Like last year, the main attraction is the standard Nintendo Switch console that includes &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;and a three-month individual membership to Nintendo Switch Online. It all costs $299.99. Nintendo confirmed that the Switch console included here is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802539/nintendo-switch-v2-new-updated-battery-console-how-to-buy"&gt;the V2 model&lt;/a&gt; with improved battery life. Altogether, these items would cost around $370, so the $299 price point is stellar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zh9EHs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10878364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zr5KG5"&gt;Several games are seeing big discounts, including ones that don’t commonly see such a big price drop. GameStop is hosting the best deals of any retailer right now (plus, these are the lowest prices of all time for these titles) on new physical editions of games, and notably, their digital editions, too. To make it easier to view and shop, I’m just going to list them below with their best sale prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDJbdv"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dZXTGz"&gt;(If you’re purchasing a lot of digital games today, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GY8NHF2/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you might need a bigger microSD card&lt;/a&gt; to store more games on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVcW2P"&gt;You can also get big discounts on more interactive experiences for Switch, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for just $55 (usually $80) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2Yu7NW5YD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for $60 (usually $100).

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbcCmK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt; is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Tuesday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2XJSUmC5J" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ/r?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (enter &lt;strong&gt;OCULUS50 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout), &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2-standalone%2Fp%2FN82E16826910033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/oculus-quest-2-all-in-one-vr-headset---256-gb-with-quest-2-carrying-case.product.100797536.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Foculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb%2F-%2FA-83984421%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKJoid"&gt;This deal extends to the $399.99 headset that doubles the storage to 256GB, which includes a $50 gift card as well. Just note that you’ll earn a gift card to the retailer where you purchased the Oculus Quest 2, unless you buy it from Oculus directly. In that case, you’ll get $50 of credit to use on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;games purchased digitally&lt;/a&gt; through the Oculus Store. If you’re a fan of creepy first-person shooters, I highly suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ux7Typ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyqXUu"&gt;You’re welcome to use your gift card however you like, but if you’re open to suggestions, I’d use it on either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ tough, zip-up case for the headset&lt;/a&gt; and its controllers, or its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap that makes the Quest 2 much more comfortable to wear&lt;/a&gt;. Each cost $50, so choose wisely (or get both, knowing that you’re spending only half as much as you would have normally to kit out your new headset).&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-11-20T18:20:50-05:00</updated>
    <title>A new DuckDuckGo tool is supposed to prevent apps from tracking Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, the DuckDuckGo logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kugUcsanlO83bAOyKqMgLzweUXU=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70171701/1234610871.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="762Atb"&gt;DuckDuckGo’s new tool aims to prevent apps from tracking Android users, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/duckduckgo-android-app-tracking-block/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tool, called App Tracking Protection, hopes to offer more protection from third-party trackers than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature&lt;/a&gt;, which gives users the choice to opt-out of data tracking within apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8duzu"&gt;However, DuckDuckGo’s tool hasn’t been rolled out as part of an update to all Android phones, nor is it available as a separate download — it’s built into DuckDuckGo’s privacy-focused browser app, but works across your device. In a &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/"&gt;post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that the tool will block “trackers it identifies in other apps from third-party companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eZ0-ZlUAYOK-PB43Nuf_MScRJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23030713/duckduckgo_block_app_tracking.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by DuckDuckGo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gA8E6R"&gt;Once App Tracking Protection is enabled, it will run in the background as you use your phone. The tool recognizes when an app is about to send data to a third-party tracker, and will then prevent the app from taking your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78K8s2"&gt;DuckDuckGo says that it’s “continually working to identify and protect against new trackers,” which means that your data should be kept away from any new trackers that crop up. From the DuckDuckGo app, you should also be able to see a real-time view of trackers that the tool has blocked, along with where your data would’ve been going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp0jfQ"&gt;The company says that although its App Tracking Protection tool isn’t a virtual private network (VPN), your device will behave as if it is one. “This is because App Tracking Protection uses a local ‘VPN connection’ which means that it works its magic right on your smartphone,” DuckDuckGo explains in its post. “However, App Tracking Protection is different from VPNs because it never routes app data through an external server.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZuzRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 96 percent of the most popular free Android apps have third-party trackers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tbLLox"&gt;While conducting its own test, DuckDuckGo found that more than 96 percent of some of the most popular free Android apps have third-party trackers that most users are unaware of. The company also discovered that 87 percent of these apps send user data to Google, while 68 percent send data to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoEZ8o"&gt;Right now the tool is in beta, but you can join the private waitlist (you won’t have to enter any personal information to do so). To sign up, download DuckDuckGo from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android"&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, and open the app. Hit “Settings” followed by “App Tracking Protection” in the “Privacy Section.” From there, choose “Join the Private Waitlist.” DuckDuckGo says it's gradually introducing the feature to more people every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcpoME"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, DuckDuckGo obviously doesn’t have the power to change the internal configuration of Android devices like Google does, which means that DuckDuckGo’s tool can’t provide the same app tracking permission prompts that appear on Android and iOS. But if you combine the App Tracking Protection tool and the privacy settings already in Android devices, you can help protect your data from third-party trackers and apps themselves. Like Apple, Google recently started making it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466531/google-android-ad-traking-advertising-identifier-id"&gt;more difficult for apps to collect data&lt;/a&gt; on users by restricting them from accessing users’ Advertising IDs after they’ve opted out of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIAmfO"&gt;Apple’s stringent App Tracking Transparency tools essentially uproot the advertising system on iPhones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756135/apple-app-tracking-transparency-policy-snapchat-facebook-twitter-youtube-lose-10-billion"&gt;reportedly costing social platforms $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; as a result. But as a report by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/23/iphone-tracking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains, Apple’s privacy system is limited, as it only blocks access to users’ Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROm2OP"&gt;A DuckDuckGo spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple’s App Tracking Transparency tool “only restricts direct access to a user’s IDFA, the rest is essentially an honor system, where Apple is asking developers to respect user choice not to track but isn’t actually blocking any third party trackers itself. App Tracking Protection blocks those third-party trackers directly, making the tool more powerful than what’s available on iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK3BPV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 21st, 9:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to clarify that DuckDuckGo’s tool can help provide more protection from third-party trackers when compared to Apple’s App Tracking Transparency tools and Android’s privacy settings alone. Also added a statement from a DuckDuckGo spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0EoZCaITRQk49s6EN-yZu7Rm5o=/0x1:881x588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70171669/bestbuy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy’s early Black Friday Deals include discounts on everything from the AirPods Pro the latest Fibit.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Best Buy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVBluv"&gt;Several retailers are getting started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early with Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the hectic, no-holds-barred weekend that kicks off right after Thanksgiving. Best Buy is one of a few — aside from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784145/amazon-black-friday-2021-best-deals-tech-cyber-monday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783434/target-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday-tech-games"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; — that got things started particularly early this year. If you’ve been paying attention to our Black Friday coverage, you’ve likely noticed dozens of deals peppered in, but that’s just a sampling. There’s more where that came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aro9Wa"&gt;Before we get into it, we’ve included some resources below that should make your Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping experience a little better. And to make things more fun, you can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"&gt;enter our sweepstakes for a chance to win a mystery bag&lt;/a&gt; filled with stuff from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s tech closet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1k44H6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="aDhEuw"&gt;Headphones and earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BFgFqH"&gt;You currently can’t throw a stone at Best Buy’s online storefront without finding a deal on headphones or true wireless earbuds. There seems to be a near-endless array of options, but here are a bunch of selected ones for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1hwZvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875864" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="DwAKD9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10847972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CWOHAQ"&gt;If you prefer earbuds, the Sony WF-1000XM4 — which have the best noise cancellation of any true wireless earbuds — &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are selling for $248&lt;/a&gt; instead of $280. The true wireless earbuds feature a smaller design and IPX4 sweat and water resistance, along with a case that supports wireless charging. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aYtNuT"&gt;Best Buy is taking $50 off a pair of Bose’s QuietComfort 45 headphones, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYqeoj9E2O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling them for $279&lt;/a&gt; instead of $329. As we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discovered in our review&lt;/a&gt;, these headphones update the company’s popular, comfortable design with USB-C, improved noise cancellation, and longer battery life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeyciO"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gGscIjTO" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save nearly $80&lt;/a&gt; when you pick up the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for $200 instead of their typical $279. We found these earbuds boast dynamic, rich sound and the best noise cancellation available in a pair of true wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ml3AOi"&gt;As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro boasts the best sound quality the company has achieved yet in a pair of earbuds, and right now you can buy them for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gDARtcbm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 instead of $200&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LiSfxi"&gt;They may not be the newest pair, but Jabra’s Elite 75t still offer bass-heavy sound, reliable performance, and can simultaneously connect to two devices. Right now, you can buy a pair of what we once called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best AirPods alternative&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2HI7HT7SB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 instead of $150&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="W37XYR"&gt;If you don’t mind a wired charging case, Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds, the AirPods, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gJc36KBg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are selling for $120&lt;/a&gt; instead of $160. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qtcPFn"&gt;Regularly $250, these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;well-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; Beats Powerbeats Pro &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2gN27JLDL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are now going for $150&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $100. These IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant earbuds feature Apple’s H1 chip for easy pairing, and provide up to nine hours of continuous battery life, with 24 hours provided by the case. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IScXXS"&gt;The Beats Studio 3 typically retail for $350, but today you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hBFLBB6j" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick them up for $170&lt;/a&gt;. The wireless, over-ear headphones come equipped with Apple’s W1 wireless chip, so you can quickly connect and switch between any Apple devices you might own. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542656/beats-studio-3-wireless-headphones-review-noise-canceling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kWlwJ9"&gt;Phones and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9mUvpe"&gt;Much of the special phone pricing is tied up with carrier deals, which typically involve activating new lines, upgrading existing ones, or trading in old devices. They often involve you paying more every month, even if the hardware is being discounted.

&lt;p id="bhi5f6"&gt;Video games are often a matter of personal taste, but here are some especially good deals on longstanding titles and early discounts on newer releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zAUYYJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876171"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CgSHfv"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, the remastered collection of all three original &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; games, is just $28 for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2i58EunJh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS4/PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2i6qXNJkx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox One/Series X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="H6x1wI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876153"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wZOj50"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2i9DDaxWK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake &lt;/em&gt;for the PS4&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is only $25&lt;/a&gt;, and if you decide to upgrade it to the PS5 version later and buy the DLC for $20, you end up paying the same price as &lt;em&gt;Intergrade&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="VDwIb9"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2 &lt;/em&gt;is available on Xbox Game Pass. If you’re not a subscriber to Microsoft’s service, however, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2jyxH8uUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;digital copy of it for just $30&lt;/a&gt;, a cool $30 off the original list price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GEuGcy"&gt;4K TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgxH9c"&gt;People love a high-quality TV, but something big and cheap can also be enticing. With that being said, here are some of the best 4K TV deals to consider at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QH5iOu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10876022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li id="vLJOud"&gt;The Facebook Portal is the perfect smart display for video chatting with loved ones who can’t be with this holiday, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2kiIguBxB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $80 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That is a substantial $100 discount, one that applies to both the black and white models. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

Best Buy is also offering the Series 3 for less, but we strongly advise spending a bit more and avoiding the aging smartwatch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full Apple Watch SE review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KgByr9"&gt;In addition to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 — which is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hJx7EdSg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in the 40mm, GPS variant for as low as $200&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off) — Best Buy is discounting its more premium sibling, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hPNG0SZa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $300&lt;/a&gt; (also $50 off). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2jXap47sL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nanoleaf Smarter Kits are up to 15 percent off&lt;/a&gt;. You can pick from hexagons, triangles, and the wood-like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2jYOZRta7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nanoleaf Elements&lt;/a&gt;, which is an exceptional value at $70 off.&lt;/li&gt;

That’s a great value for a mesh system, especially given the point doubles as a smart speaker. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="wU7Gio"&gt;A three-pack of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2jUuzLwhr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue white and color smart bulbs is $100&lt;/a&gt; ($35 off). &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wmhaFP"&gt;Cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MhjAo8"&gt;System cameras for photo and video offer a lot of creative control and flexibility compared to a smartphone, and here are some worthwhile deals for those who want to go a step above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OtxhMj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2IWc8igsB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony A7III with 28-70mm kit lens is $200 off&lt;/a&gt;, making the combo an even $2,000. The newer A7IV is on its way next month, but it will be a higher price for the body only. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17176246/sony-a7-a7r-iii-alpha-3-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wUCItY"&gt;Sony’s ZV-1, a vlogger-designed point and shoot, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2iFi5hFi4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $650&lt;/a&gt; ($100 off). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZqOG7r"&gt;If your camera doesn’t need the latest and fastest SD cards, you can stock up on Sandisk’s 128GB Extreme Plus UHS-I cards &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2iHc3B5to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $20 each&lt;/a&gt; ($48 off).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y1YvU5"&gt;The top marks for camera deals from Best Buy right now go to the GoPro Hero10 Black. The excellent action cam &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2ii416cbK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $50 off right now&lt;/a&gt;, and comes with a $50 Best Buy gift card to use on your next purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The massive 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 gaming monitor is $400 off on Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nhZ-kIzIVdIkfFV6TZFMI0PccQs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70171305/shollister_201030_42850012.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pOKhMV"&gt;The Samsung Odyssey G9 gaming monitor is on sale right now for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down $400 from its original $1399 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXoXg2"&gt;The 49-inch 5120 x 1440 monitor comes with a fast 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and supports both G-Sync and FreeSync 2. As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;our review of the Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt;, the curved monitor offers an immersive gaming experience, stretching around your entire field of vision as you game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKeEYm"&gt;It produces incredibly vivid colors thanks to its QLED display and emits 1,000 nits of brightness. My colleague, Sean Hollister, pretty much sums up what it’s like to game on this behemoth of a screen in his review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aa9xVh"&gt;I’m not kidding when I say I have to avert my eyes when I launch &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; in HDR, and I could swear I felt the flames the first few times my &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;’ TIE Bomber blasted an X-Wing into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BppKYR"&gt;Samsung debuted an upgraded version of this display in July, called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22587089/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-49-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-price-specs-release-date-features"&gt;Odyssey Neo G9 monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Like the standard Odyssey G9, it’s also a 49-inch curved monitor with mostly the same specs. The main difference is that Odyssey G9 Neo has a mini-LED backlit panel that produces 2,000 nits of brightness, allowing for more contrast. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is currently trying out this monitor, and we’re finding that it may not be worth its hefty $2,499 price tag due to various issues we’re seeing — but we’ll go over that in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICZ0fY"&gt;As for the much cheaper $999 Odyssey G9, there aren’t any details on how long the deal will last on Amazon. However, we can speculate that it’s an early Black Friday promotion, so it may not be around too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy Bebop’s English voice cast has strong feelings about the movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cowboy Bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lg5GUVuTyknrFGTIA1I9jdOxl20=/0x11:1146x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170984/bebop.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is just as important to the Netflix show as the animated series, but it isn’t receiving the same kind of consideration&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HHp3Lp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;, known in Japan by the much better name &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop: Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt;, was released in 2001 and takes place during the show’s final handful of episodes. Most anime movies don’t impact the overall arc of the show, featuring enemies, allies, and plot points that are rarely ever acknowledged outside the movie’s quarantine zone. However, &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt; transcends the trope of the inconsequential anime movie and is critical to the conversation surrounding the show’s cultural impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAKyPm"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt;, the gang are unwittingly sucked into a bio-terrorism plot, forced to stop the evil Vincent Volaju before he unleashes a deadly storm of nanobots on Mars. The movie hits on all the little things that make a typical &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; episode great. Every character gets a moment to let their unique talents save the day. There’s an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4haw18bnN1g"&gt;absolutely bitchin’ spaceship battle&lt;/a&gt; underscored by Yoko Kanno’s soul-stealing soundtrack. And at the end, the bad guy is tragically relatable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9T_lxaxcW3EYmpH0EPY8n4cTVR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028495/CBP_e014_0076.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kESb7t"&gt;It’s the villain’s tragedy that makes &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt; so crucial to &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s narrative. Every episode of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; gives you the tiniest glimpse into what makes each character tick, and in the movie, that glimpse widens into a window through which we are allowed to see the characters as never before. For the English voice cast of the show, the movie contains some of their most memorable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OT4We8"&gt;“I actually got emotional regarding Spike’s experience,” Beau Billingslea, voice actor for Jet Black, says of the movie in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz35It"&gt;Steve Blum, voice of Spike Spiegel, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdN9nG"&gt;“I think the most profound moment for me was in the movie when he was talking to Electra about the pain that he was experiencing and his loss and damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szsnNa"&gt;Blum’s referring to one of the movie’s quieter moments in which he’s stuck in a prison with Elektra Ovirowa — voiced by &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Commander Shepard, Jennifer Hale. As Elektra shares her past romantic connection with Vincent, Spike shares a bit of his own history in the murderous Syndicate mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvKWFD"&gt;“When I was younger, I wasn’t afraid of anything,” Spike says to Elektra in the movie. “I didn’t have the slightest fear of dying. [...] But then I met a certain woman and it changed. For the first time the idea of death began to scare me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bNNE6e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XTXIWE7dIE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxYBZo"&gt;“It was the first time that he really got vulnerable,” Blum says, crediting that moment as the deepest and most open Spike ever is. This movie moment exposes in Spike a “vulnerability that he tried so hard to hide, or escape,” according to Blum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQP3db"&gt;Wendee Lee, the voice of Faye Valentine, also holds the movie in high regard. “We know all of these characters have damage,” Lee says. “We explore that systematically throughout the series. [...] But they save Spike for the film. Much later. Think of the genius that’s in the beats of storytelling in the way &lt;em&gt;Bebop &lt;/em&gt;delivers the story. I think that in itself is one of the greater appeals of the whole franchise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuKheL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; the series was recorded separately and disjointedly, with the actors coming in solo to record their scenes, one by one. Though the camaraderie we hear in the banter of the crew was recorded in isolation, it was no less genuine — and genuine in the actors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzW3VQ"&gt;“Steve left me a note in the script,” Billingslea recalls. “He said, ‘Hey Beau, Jet sucks.’ So I went forward in the script, and I said, ‘Hey Steve, Spike sucks, and the Bebop to my ship.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="20SKms"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the most profound moment for me was in the movie when he was talking to Elektra about the pain that he was experiencing and his loss and damage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfbikl"&gt;For the movie, the actors were brought into a big recording studio with the movie’s producers close at hand to offer opinions on actors’ performances. Despite that distraction, Blum says that recording the moment between Elektra and Spike was so emotional he “broke down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcZe1H"&gt;“And the moment was fairly brief compared to the exposition for a lot of the other characters,” Blum continues. “And yet [it was] so incredibly powerful, and then goes right back into the action shortly after, it was kind of amazing. It really taught me that a moment can change your life for the better for the worse. It changed me as an actor, changed me as a person. And I didn’t have that realization until many years later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oo6Je"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;importance to &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; isn’t only because of profound character and actor moments, it’s also home to two of the best songs in the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack canon and the actors agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RhaSe"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0V-WGwJJj58"&gt;Gotta Knock A Little Harder&lt;/a&gt;” is one of Blum’s favorite songs (and mine, not gonna lie) as is “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YA4P1A3jtu0"&gt;What Planet Is This&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgzWGs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is having a renaissance. Twenty-two years after the show’s release, Netflix is launching a live-action adaptation along with making the original anime available on its streaming platform (the anime is also available to stream on Funimation). But amid the surge of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/em&gt;news — the live-action show’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783815/netflix-cowboy-bebop-soundtrack"&gt;soundtrack will launch on Spotify&lt;/a&gt; the same day as the show — the movie seems to be missing from the conversation. It does not help that it can’t be streamed anywhere. It’s not available on either Netflix or Crunchyroll even though both services carry the show. (Curiously, though, you can stream it on Netflix in Canada — lucky Canadians.) The only reason I was able to rewatch the movie myself was because I still had a physical copy that I made my father buy from a Blockbuster the day it was released. &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt; is just as embedded into the DNA of the live-action show as the anime itself, and when we talk about how great &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is, it should be included.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images of the Google Pixel 6A show a more compact device with no headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzaoKf8ZjQ2Dn-2IPdMFSsMfxqw=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170839/google_pixel_6a_leak.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The leaked image of the mid-range Google Pixel 6A looks nearly identical to the Pixel 6. | Image: Steve Hemmerstoffer / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6a-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1u1f0G"&gt;Rendered images of the Google Pixel 6A have been leaked by reliable leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks"&gt;@OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;), and give us a glimpse at what the midrange device may look like, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6a-renders-exclusive/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mju2C6L3H1aLwoTeM61nmOhw1BU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23030217/back_google_pixel_6a_leak.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The leaked images show the Google Pixel 6A without a headphone jack. | Image: Steve Hemmerstoffer / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6a-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jEfjF4"&gt;The rendered Pixel 6A, which belongs to the budget-friendly Pixel A-series lineup, looks almost identical to the standard Pixel 6. It seems to sport the same black camera strip on its rear that houses two cameras and a flash, along with a hole-punch selfie camera on the front. The bottom of the device appears to have a USB-C port, as well as a speaker and a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDsXY5"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/20/google-pixel-6a-size-renders/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there appears to be no fingerprint sensor on the outside of the device — this might mean the scanner is placed beneath the screen just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which Google recently issued an update for in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787537/google-pixel-6-pro-update-fingerprint-scanner-slow"&gt;attempt to improve the scanner’s performance&lt;/a&gt; issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MKvPAo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6A could be the first midrange Pixel device to come without a headphone jack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yT8Yn1"&gt;A headphone jack also appears to be absent from the Pixel 6A. If the rendered images are accurate, the Pixel 6A could be the first midrange Pixel device to come without one — previously, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530449/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-photos-video-specs-price-release-date-features-io-2019"&gt;Pixel 3A&lt;/a&gt; all had headphone jacks, as opposed to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usCP6b"&gt;The Pixel 6A may also be a lot more compact than the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, measuring at just 152.2 x 71.8. x 8.7mm with a 6.2-inch display (via &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;). This is quite a bit smaller when compared to the size of a vanilla Pixel 6, which is 158.6 x 74.8 x 8.9mm with a 6.4-inch display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO4XZE"&gt;There’s no word on when the Pixel 6A will be released — after all, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro only came out last month — so we’ll probably have to wait a while to see some official images of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astra reaches orbit for the first time with LV0007 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VyI7Rhu4kSOnFKRvydPSmghOVDc=/144x0:2403x1506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170468/astra_reaches_orbit.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astra’s rocket prepares for takeoff from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97qhttuqtB4" target="_blank"&gt;NASASpaceflight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z702wQ"&gt;Astra is now on the list of privately-owned space companies that have successfully reached orbit. Its Launch Vehicle 0007 (LV0007), which was carrying a test payload for the US military, took off from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak Island, Alaska on Saturday at 1:16AM ET. Following a smooth liftoff, the 43-foot rocket achieved orbit around nine minutes later at 500km above Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qSfZf5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Astra just reached orbit! 7.61km/sec at our targeted 86.0 degree inclination at an altitude of 500km. The team worked hard for this. We’re just getting started, folks. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdAstra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AdAstra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/NiMhCEsuCI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NiMhCEsuCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Kemp (@Kemp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kemp/status/1461960864391598088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jiPW2t"&gt;“The team’s worked so hard on this for so many years,” said Astra CEO Chris Kemp during a livestream after the launch. “We have rocket serial number eight, nine, 10 in production, so we’re just getting started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tyURA2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup’s successful launch follows several failed attempts at reaching orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NUkI2"&gt;The California-based startup’s successful launch follows several failed attempts at reaching orbit. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21161727/darpa-launch-challenge-astra-space-competition-no-winner-prize"&gt;first attempted launch&lt;/a&gt; took place during the DARPA competition in March 2020, which tests rocket companies’ abilities to respond to requests from the US military. Astra wasn’t able to get its rocket off the ground due to technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taiA8c"&gt;Later that year in September, Astra attempted to reach orbit once again, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21433698/astra-rocket-launch-end-failure-orbit"&gt;issues with the rocket’s guidance system&lt;/a&gt; led Astra to cut the flight short. Just three months later, Astra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178110/astra-small-satellite-launcher-rocket-3-2-alaska-success-orbit"&gt;reached space for the first time&lt;/a&gt; with its Rocket 3.2 launch, however, it wasn’t able to successfully slip into orbit after running low on fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJiaq0"&gt;Astra’s most recent attempt was in August of this year. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722331/astra-rocket-launch-failure-identified-lv0007"&gt;engine failure caused&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647094/astra-rocket-lv0006-launch-failed"&gt;LV0006 to slide across&lt;/a&gt; the launchpad during takeoff, and the rocket only reached an altitude of 31 miles before Astra terminated the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks4QDk"&gt;Now, Astra joins Virgin Orbit, SpaceX, and Rocket Lab as one of the few US companies that have achieved orbit with a privately-owned rocket. You can watch Astra’s entire launch from the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/97qhttuqtB4"&gt;NASASpaceflight YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwBbiu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 20, 4:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story incorrectly referenced Virgin Galactic instead of Virgin Orbit. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
