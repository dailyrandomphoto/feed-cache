    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.2 patch promises to tone down omniscient teleporting cops and pinball driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLlVc2nqHMYdfNPOme0yd9JJRt8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994646/cyberpunk_2077_screenshot_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FZSaB"&gt;CD Projekt Red (CDPR) has detailed the improvements it plans to bring to &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; in its upcoming 1.2 patch. &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37768/whats-new-in-night-city-patch-1-2-development-insight"&gt;The announcement&lt;/a&gt;, written as an in-universe newscast, details the planned quality-of-life improvements, including police not instantly appearing when you commit a crime, an improved driving experience, and a setting that should prevent you from accidentally dodging into traffic or off a building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQ1P6m"&gt;While the game has received a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of criticism for being generally buggy — and, in some respects, unfinished — it does seem like CDPR is trying to address some of the most memed-on complaints. In the section of the blog post about the improved police response, there’s a jokey in-universe anecdote that captures an experience many players will have had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="SFv3fT"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;My choom, Jake, was in a shoot-out with Tyger Claws the other day, when he missed a shot and hit a pedestrian on the other side of the street. In an instant, the NCPD swarmed up on him and put him down. It’s like they appeared out of thin air right behind his back! It’s too brutal of a response for a regular accidental murder if you ask me!&lt;/em&gt;” — Mike from Kabuki, 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lYvniZ"&gt;The driving experience in the game is also, uh, not very good. CDPR is hoping to make it better by improving the steering response (you can see a comparison video below) and making it so your car can automatically get unstuck if it finds itself resting on a barrier or other object. While the improved steering should help, there’s also plenty of other issues with driving (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;such as collision detection&lt;/a&gt;) that will have to be addressed before driving becomes, you know, fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xoL9SY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IJHhQmmwyc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bkWz8N"&gt;The patch was initially supposed to come out in February but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299184/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-delayed-cd-projekt-red-studio-hack"&gt;was delayed&lt;/a&gt; when the studio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274035/cd-projekt-hack-source-code-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-encrypt-data-ransom"&gt;fell victim to a ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. CDPR is now aiming to release it in “&lt;a href="https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/patch-1-2-development-update.11081719/"&gt;the second half of March.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9Mpci"&gt;It’s now been &lt;a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2021/03/cdprs_blockbuster_rpg_cyberpunk_2077_now_nearing_three_months_missing_from_ps_store"&gt;around three months&lt;/a&gt; since the game was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt; due to the immense number of bugs (and the fact that it was nearly unplayable on a base PlayStation 4). So far, Sony and CDPR haven't responded to requests for comment on when the game will return to the platform, so it’s unclear if this patch will be enough to return the game to the platform’s online shop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are down for many</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ppGbX_-aDd_0l9JqdRHAw0kMYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994607/akrales_180614_1777_0229.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x05WR"&gt;Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are down for many right now. More than 123,000 users have reported issues with Instagram &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/instagram/"&gt;on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;. More than 23,000 users have reported issues with &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/whatsapp/"&gt;WhatsApp on DownDetector, too&lt;/a&gt;, and the service is down for one &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer’s family, who is based in Europe. Facebook Messenger seems to be affected as well, with &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook-messenger/"&gt;more than 5,000 reports of problems on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ONKRk"&gt;When navigating to Instagram’s website, I saw a white page with the message, “5xx Server Error.” And when I re-downloaded Instagram to my phone and tried to log in, I hit an error there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RZ8YoUgbcGJ438PaefAwYg4jqD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383062/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.27.53_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uHeE7u"&gt;Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Series X is available at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nY2j_p_nE6Ao5sivv5G3AtMVzAo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994430/vpavic_201103_4275_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VDZvv5"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735353446912891740#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; consoles launched a few months ago, but if you have been keeping up with the news, you know that these consoles are some of the hardest products to buy right now. Those looking for another shot at the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735353446912891740#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 Series X&lt;/a&gt; can try their luck right now at Best Buy. You will have the option to pay for either console in full or through Xbox All Access, which would allow you to get the console with no upfront cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoCh5e"&gt;Due to the high demand, the retailer is releasing small waves of inventory for the console every few minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="v2iBsS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10384596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwoxv5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLuT14"&gt;Once you’ve secured your next-gen Xbox, you might want to buy some additional items, such as games to play on your new console. Several of the most popular games to play on these consoles include third-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21332881/xbox-studios-games-series-x-optimized-forza-gears"&gt;popular Xbox One titles&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fforza-horizon-4%2F9pnqkhfld2wq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;received graphical updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sah8hS"&gt;Of course, if you are unsure what games to buy, you could always subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of first- and third-party titles from various developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xmQCoE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PbVSAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce6rHG"&gt;A must-have accessory I think is worth buying is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt; if you plan to play couch co-op games with family or friends. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gotham Knights is delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioRfI1MVO1xJsLEyy4ZYJzUUlvM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994346/screenshot_02.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eF7WXa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;, the upcoming title by Warner Bros. Games Montreal, has been delayed into 2022, the company announced today. In a statement posted on Twitter, the development team explains that it wants to give the game “more time to deliver the best possible experience for players.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HI7l6"&gt;While not directly stated, the delay is likely COVID-related, as studios continue to adapt to working from home. This is the second highly anticipated title from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment getting pushed back into next year, following the announcement in January that Avalanche Software’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229085/hogwarts-legacy-delay-2022-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; will not hit its 2021 release window&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6j7kAT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In a self-isolated world, developers are learning to make games from home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222465/coronavirus-game-developers-work-from-home-bungie-riot"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="W43OES"&gt;Announced during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376323/gotham-knights-fandome-warner-bros-montreal-batman-game"&gt;DC FanDome event&lt;/a&gt; in late August, &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397224/gotham-knights-gameplay-footage-warnerbros-games-montreal-fandome-robin-batgirl"&gt;open-world action RPG&lt;/a&gt; featuring Batman and some supporting cast such as Batgirl and Robin. While no firm release date has yet been announced, &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt; will release on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, and Xbox One. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ChilledCow puts channel name out to pasture with a rebrand to ‘Lofi Girl’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-MnZYJEXEbJLeF0IHbtTTpzti4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994340/40c40c35_3727_4939_b82b_2f1061b12197.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sTl5Zv"&gt;The hugely popular lo-fi music YouTube channel ChilledCow isn’t just known for its chill, cozy beats; the iconic animations of the girl sitting and working at her desk are instantly recognizable around the internet. (She’s even being turned into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/11/22325348/youtooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine"&gt;one-foot-tall figurine&lt;/a&gt;.) And on Thursday, the channel’s sixth anniversary, ChilledCow fully embraced the icon by rebranding the channel to “Lofi Girl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE44WU"&gt;“This was a very tough decision to make, but the driving force behind it is the fact that ChilledCow’s name was chosen many years ago, and is no longer reflective of what the channel is about anymore,” Lofi Girl said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl/status/1372643625167958023/photo/1"&gt;in a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EfKgsW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/hwfmZ9jACT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hwfmZ9jACT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lofi Girl (@lofigirl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl/status/1372643625167958023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ipX5pJ"&gt;The YouTube channel is indeed called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; now, and the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lofigirl"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lofigirl"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; accounts are @lofigirl. (The Instagram account is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chilledcow_yt/"&gt;still @chilledcow_yt&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe that will change soon.) Otherwise, the channel remains the same — there is still a live stream of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;soft electronic beats to work or relax to&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWcJFNfaw9c"&gt;second, mellower stream&lt;/a&gt;, if that’s what you’re in the mood for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT0mLJ"&gt;“Don’t worry, this change won’t affect in any way the content on the channel but will instead pave the way for many exciting projects for you all in the future!” Lofi Girl said. “The channel has been and always will be about music, art and positivity only.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaio Z (2021) review: carbon tax</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A lightweight laptop with a sky-high price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="R7XYXG"&gt;The Vaio Z is, speaking pragmatically, a proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBAa27"&gt;There are two things about it that are groundbreaking — at least on paper. The first is that it’s made entirely of carbon fiber. While plenty of high-end laptops, including the Dell XPS 13, have sheets of carbon fiber across their palm rests and other materials on the sides, the Vaio Z includes &lt;em&gt;contoured&lt;/em&gt; carbon fiber, meaning the material is molded around the edges, and the whole thing is carbon fiber. (Vaio says the Z is the first laptop to use contoured carbon fiber, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/31/3054260/gigabyte-x11-carbon-fiber-laptop-lightest-announcement"&gt;2012 Gigabyte X11&lt;/a&gt; also claims an all-carbon fiber build.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIfy17"&gt;The second is, at 2.11 pounds, the Vaio Z is the lightest laptop to include an Intel H-Series chip. (That refers to the lightest-possible configuration. I was sent a slightly heavier one at 2.32 pounds.) H-Series processors are high-performance chips most commonly found in gaming laptops and workstations. It’s highly unusual to see one in a thin and light laptop, especially one that’s just over two pounds; machines of this size generally include the lower-powered U-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU0cMb"&gt;This model includes the quad-core Core i7-11375H, the current flagship of Intel’s brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;“Tiger Lake H” series&lt;/a&gt;. When announcing the chip at CES, Intel claimed it would offer the fastest single-thread performance on the market, with boost clock speeds up to 5GHz. That’s an impressive prospect, especially in a 2.3-pound chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV03PE"&gt;But the third thing to understand about the Vaio Z is that it’s not cheap. The base model is — I’m not kidding — $3,579 for a Core i7-11375H, a 14-inch 4K screen, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. You can go all the way up to a $4,179 system with 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. I was sent a model in the middle, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="79cNfS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10370468"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pbMz6W"&gt;A laptop of that price isn’t a realistic purchase for most people, even if it’s spectacular. So instead, I’m going to use this review to explore two questions that concern the future of the luxury laptop market — questions the Vaio Z is setting out to answer: one, is contoured carbon fiber the future? And two, can a 2.32-pound laptop with an H-Series processor work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vS4s5A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vaio claims that the Vaio Z is sturdier and feels nicer than other laptops&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KFLbhK"&gt;Unfortunately, as of this writing, the answer to both of those questions is “not yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHgHTm"&gt;We’ll start with the build. Vaio’s elevator pitch is that the contoured carbon fiber is both stronger than other common materials (like magnesium alloy and aluminum alloy) that other premium laptops are made of, and ideal for combining rigidity with a light build. Carbon fiber also allows manufacturers to tailor stiffness and flexibility to specific regions of the laptop (using the number of layers and direction of lamination). Vaio claims, consequently, the Vaio Z is sturdier and feels nicer than other laptops close to its weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z from the left side, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2wc3Oml1UXhM5w8m5cu6-tbQ2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341486/mchin_210225_4449_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carbon fiber laminate on all four sides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R86ymx"&gt;Sturdiness and rigidity are difficult claims to verify with a review unit for obvious reasons. Vaio says the Z has passed MIL-STD 10H torture tests, including drop tests, pressure tests, and body-twist tests among others. There aren’t a ton of 2.3-pound laptops out there, and I don’t doubt that the Vaio Z may be objectively better-built than the rest of that class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BV1KZm"&gt;But does it feel &lt;em&gt;sturdy&lt;/em&gt;? Not really. There’s a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; amount of flex in the keyboard and screen. While I usually have to push pretty hard to get keyboards to bend, the area under the Shift key trampolined with a firm thumb press. The display is so bendy that I was careful when torquing it because I was legitimately afraid of snapping it in half. I know most people aren’t actively trying to bend their laptops, but I would be afraid that putting too much weight on this unit could damage the screen and keyboard over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuiQOg"&gt;When I initially asked Vaio about this, the company told me that the product is still in the preorder stage, and chassis quality would improve closer to its shipping date. The company later sent me a mass-production model. That the keyboard deck turned out to be a bit sturdier, particularly the area under the shift key. That said, the considerable flex in the screen remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2MLhAKqCb8gZndUzoE6zJ7XyMxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341482/mchin_190527_4449_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key tops are concave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AM0FLT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The lid and bottom have a plasticky texture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsgICJ"&gt;The carbon fiber’s texture is certainly unique. I like the feel of the palm rests, sides, and bottom. But the lid has plasticky texture. I wouldn’t guess that the Z was a $3,500 laptop just from holding it, especially right after holding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. The other thing to note is that the whole chassis is a fingerprint magnet — the lid, the sides, the palm rests, the keyboard. I could wipe the prints off easily, but they were always back in abundance after a few hours of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDnKCo"&gt;The carbon fiber does contribute to one significant benefit, though: the Vaio Z is unbelievably light. It’s so light that picking it up messes with your mind; it’s hard to believe there’s anything inside. This would certainly be the best laptop to buy if you’re looking for the lightest of the light. But if you’re looking for a sturdy, rigid form factor, I’m dubious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z lid seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cj1M2lF4F-3Q9qlDnJ01saU4cWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341480/mchin_190527_4449_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaio has been using multilayer carbon fiber in laptops since 2003. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DwMnas"&gt;On to the second question: has Vaio managed to put H-Series power in a U-Series form factor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKtBI3"&gt;In a literal sense, yes. The laptop works. And the one thing I do appreciate is the battery life. I averaged six hours and 57 minutes of continuous office multitasking with the display at 200 nits of brightness and Battery Saver on. That’s less juice than I get from the M1 MacBook Pro, but it’s fine as Intel H-Series processors go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CHsyMC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10370480"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOgYq8"&gt;But in terms of raw power, results are mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJo4x6"&gt;I ran several benchmarks to see how this brand-new chip stacks up against some of the more powerful thin systems out there — particularly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s M1-based MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;, which is powered by one of Intel’s top Tiger Lake U-Series chips. Note that while both of these models are heavier than the Vaio Z, they’re also less than half its price. So I was hoping it would solidly outperform them under the heavy loads that you’d want an H-Series processor for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1p4y54"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10370542"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8M5hqj"&gt;The Z beat the Razer Book in our Adobe Premiere Pro export test by a bit less than a minute — a victory, to be sure, but not a margin to write home about. More disappointingly, it lost to the MacBook Pro by a similar margin on that test. Apple’s laptop also came out ahead in every other test I ran apart from Cinebench’s single-core benchmark. (That’s expected; single-core performance is what Intel claims is so great about this chip.) That’s not a great argument for spending multiple thousands more on the Vaio Z, even with its impressive chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JtIeDE"&gt;One issue seems to be that the Vaio Z’s 65W charger is insufficient for the types of loads most users would want an H-Series processor for. During several Adobe Premiere Pro exports and several runs of Cinebench multicore, the laptop’s battery drained even though it was plugged in. (Nothing else was running during these tests.) This could be a problem if you’re hoping to run intense loads for long periods of time, especially if you’re not always starting at a full charge. More importantly, it means power delivery may have been limiting the Vaio Z’s performance on these tasks. (Vaio tells me this is by design; it wanted to keep the charger small and portable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z on a table with three potted plants in the background, open and angled to the left. The screen displays a red flower on a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IEKTcfBDI60216ossUTofd9B8VU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341484/mchin_190527_4449_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fold-under hinge is supposed to provide a more ergonomic typing experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwVjqx"&gt;To Vaio’s credit, the Z has impressive cooling for such a small machine. Neither the chassis nor the CPU ever reached a worrisome temperature. But the dual fans were mega-loud during heavy loads, and sometimes under lighter ones as well. My mom could hear the unit from the next room over while it was running a Premiere export. She told me later that she “thought it was going to take off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAo3mN"&gt;For the benefit of folks with deep pockets who are considering buying this laptop, I’ll run through the rest of the specs. The highlight is the backlit keyboard, which provides 1.5mm of travel. It’s excellent — comfortable, smooth, and not at all loud. You also get a webcam with a convenient physical privacy shutter, which supports Windows Hello. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio logo below the bottom left corner of the Vaio Z keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lYFy0LsSwzAOpaqMDY_zMwi5CYk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341481/mchin_190527_4449_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaio says it “aimed for a comfortable keystroke that feels as if it is absorbed by your fingertips.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vaio Z open, seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCeEWccGJtdc2zhZuP2AiO11YGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341485/mchin_210225_4449_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charger delivers up to 65W and weighs 0.36 pounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="asxvkg"&gt;Audio is standard laptop fare: it gets impressively loud without audible distortion, but percussion and bass are almost nonexistent. You can swap to “Movie Mode” and “Gaming Mode” in the Dolby Audio software that comes preloaded on the Vaio Z, and I preferred listening to my music on these profiles. They strengthen the background music beneath the vocals and give everything a stronger surround quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="aMINTD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I wish there was a USB-A&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="guENJx"&gt;Connectivity includes two USB Type-C ports (supporting Thunderbolt 4, power delivery, and DisplayPort 1.4), a headphone jack, a security lock slot, and an HDMI. I know the Vaio’s space is limited, but I wish there was a USB-A port in there. You also get a nice 3840 x 2160 non-touch display and a roomy touchpad (though it has physical clickers on the bottom, which I always find to be a huge pain). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6chViE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vaio SX14 review: Lots of ports mean business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295153/vaio-sx14-review-lots-of-ports-mean-business"},{"title":"The Vaio SX12 offers too little for too much","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21153098/vaio-sx12-review-display-design-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9WwMeh"&gt;I have two strong opinions about the Vaio Z: one, it’s an impressive feat of engineering, and two, it’s still too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0tsAX"&gt;Vaio’s achievements with contoured carbon fiber are commendable. It’s unusual to see, whether Vaio is the first to do it. And the fact that there’s a 2.32-pound laptop on shelves at all, let alone one housing an H-Series processor, makes me optimistic about the future of the market. It’s been a very cool device to use, one I’m grateful to have experienced first-hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQrsKl"&gt;But the performance bump the Core i7-11375H delivers in this form factor isn’t enough of an improvement to justify a multithousand-dollar premium over all kinds of more affordable models on the market today, whether they contain M1 chips, AMD chips, or chips from Intel itself. Neither is the contoured carbon fiber — which, while cool, won’t bring a concrete benefit to most customers. At half its price, the Vaio Z would be in the conversation; at $3,579, I’m happy to commend it from afar. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer TravelMate P6 review: a suitable business partner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A consumer laptop in business clothing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="It86Su"&gt;Any business laptop that comes out these days is entering a tough field full of very established players. The world is already stuffed full of ThinkPads and Latitudes, which have strong followings, cover price ranges across the board, and are highly attuned to what workers need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbKS6Y"&gt;So my question with lesser-known business laptops is usually: Where does this fit? What customer is it catering to who might be underserved by a ThinkPad? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHpfdN"&gt;With its TravelMate line (specifically the TravelMate P6), Acer seems to be going for two potential openings. The first is that the TravelMate is, as the name implies, specifically intended for frequent business travelers. It’s light, portable, and sturdy, at the expense of some other traits. And the second is its price. Starting at $1,199.99, the TravelMate line is targeting a more price-conscious demographic than many business laptops that would be considered “premium” are. I think the TravelMate succeeds in filling these two niches in particular. But it has some other drawbacks that make it tough to recommend for a general audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nKVDZa"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10401449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer logo and power button on the Acer TravelMate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DosRLAQeUmaxRXf6QhbcX21ZmS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310314/akrales_210212_4404_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer says the TravelMate is for “modern, mobile, security-conscious customers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 keyboard and touchpad seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnfebFq53Vu9lzePOb5tMk1-tfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310322/akrales_210212_4404_0147.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, all business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ncirZ2"&gt;The aspect of the TravelMate that should be a big help to mobile business users is the port selection. Despite being quite thin, the laptop is able to fit a USB Type-C (supporting USB 3.1 Gen 2, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3, and USB charging), two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 (one with power-off USB charging), one HDMI 2.0, one microSD reader, one combination audio jack, one Ethernet port (with a trap-door hinge), one DC-In jack for Acer’s adapter, one lock slot, and an optional SmartCard reader. The fewer dongles and docks you have to travel with, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VnPEX"&gt;Portability is another priority here and is another one of the TravelMate’s highlight features. At just 2.57 pounds and 0.65 inches thick, the TravelMate should be a breeze to carry around in a backpack or briefcase. Acer says it’s put the product through a slew of durability tests for weight and pressure, drops, shocks, vibrations, and other hiccups you may encounter during the day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRuqSo"&gt;Another area that’s likely important to some mobile professionals is videoconferencing capability. I found that to be a mixed bag here. The TravelMate’s four-microphone array had no trouble catching my voice, in both voice recognition and Zoom meeting use cases. Acer says they can pick up voices from up to 6.5 feet away. The webcam also produces a fine picture (though this unit doesn’t support Windows Hello for easy logins) and has a physical privacy shutter. The speakers are not great, though — music was tinny with thin percussion and nonexistent bass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate half closed angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aq4pqC9B0nRQrWijJk2zGTWjb_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310324/akrales_210212_4404_0160.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer promises that the TravelMate can survive “the bumps from airport security, accidental drops, and other mishaps.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Ct2GXY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10401463"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y64T5g"&gt;The TravelMate also includes some business-specific features including a TPM 2.0 chip and Acer’s ProShield security software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7cCAv"&gt;In other, less business-y areas, though, the TravelMate has a few shortcomings. Shoppers looking for anything more than portability out of the chassis may be disappointed. While most of the TravelMate is made of magnesium-aluminum alloy, it has a bit of a plasticky feel — and while the keyboard is sturdy, there’s considerable flex in the screen. And then there’s the aesthetic: the P6 is far from the prettiest computer you can buy for $1,199.99. It’s almost entirely black, with very few accents (and the ones it has are a drab gray color). And the bezels around the 16:9 screen are quite chunky by modern standards. Plus, the 16:9 aspect ratio is falling out of fashion for a reason — it’s cramped for multitasking, especially on a 13- or 14-inch screen — and the panel maxed out at 274 nits in my testing, which is a bit too dim for outdoor use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 open from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wOJHizhsI--3l9oN9_F0xFuXBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310326/akrales_210212_4404_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The color is called “mild black.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8BIx0B"&gt;The TravelMate looks and feels like it was made a bit better than budget fare. But it also looks and feels closer to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21815008/acer-aspire-5-review-2020-15-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Aspire 5&lt;/a&gt; than it does to a top ThinkPad. For context, you can get an Aspire 5 with identical specs to this TravelMate model for &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAcer-Aspire-5-15-6-Full-HD-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-i5-10210U-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Pure-Silver-A515-54-55AA%2F270762147" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just over $700&lt;/a&gt;. Another comparison: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 5&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous consumer laptop that’s even lighter than the TravelMate, can be purchased with comparable specs for just &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-5-laptop-sf514-55ta-56ch%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.A6SAA.002&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99&lt;/a&gt;. This is all to emphasize that you’re sacrificing a bit of build quality (as well as some extra money) for the TravelMate’s weight and business-specific offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPPyoQ"&gt;The touchpad is also not my favorite. For one, I had some palm-rejection issues. Those didn’t interfere with my work per se, but it was still unnerving to see my cursor jumping around the screen while I was typing. In addition, the touchpad on my unit had a bit of give before the actuation point, meaning one click required me to make (and hear) what felt like two clicks. And its off-center placement meant that I was constantly right-clicking when I meant to left-click, and I had to consciously reach over to the left side in order to click with my right hand. Finally, the click itself is shallow and far from the most comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SHbN2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10401475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjXqQG"&gt;I also didn’t love the power button. It contains a fingerprint sensor, which worked quite well. But the button itself is stiff and very shallow. I know this sounds like a small nitpick, but it was really irksome and made turning the TravelMate on in the morning more of a hassle than it could’ve been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 on a small table open, angled slightly to the right, seen from above.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some TravelMate models support facial recognition, but my model did not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XPp0Xo"&gt;The TravelMate model that I received to review is sold out everywhere I’ve looked as of this writing. The closest model to it is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Ftravelmate-p6-laptop-tmp614-51-g2-5442%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.VNNAA.001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed at $1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s cheaper through &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Facer-travelmate-p6-tmp614-51-g2-5442-14-notebook-intel-i5-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-windows-10-pro%2Fproduct_IM17TW838%3FstoreId%3D10001%26AID%3D13957703%26PID%3D5735146%26SID%3Ds1616083156788ylu0a52402%26cvosrc%3Daffiliate.cj.5735146%26cvo_campaign%3DOther%26cm_mmc%3DCJ-_-5735146-_-5735146-_-13957703%26CID%3DAFF%253A5735146%253A5735146%253A13957703%26CJPIXEL%3DCJPIXEL%26cjevent%3D934e17b288cb11eb8113005b0a1c0e14%26dclid%3DCMa8n4LcvO8CFUMY5wodQrQAfw%26userEnv%3D%26tenantId%3DStaplesDotCom%26locale%3Den-US%26zipCode%3D87101%26channel%3DWEB%26encode%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some retailers&lt;/a&gt;) and comes with a Core i5-10310U, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage. My unit is the same, but it has a Core i5-10210U. Those processors &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/i5-10310U-vs-i5-10210U-vs-i7-10610U_12202_11459_12200.247596.0.html?fbclid=IwAR3TMjcPI7DXrVhIGYQ4Uw8lomm0hhCT1liBp57AKjyp6iw5nSDpGrRyt-o"&gt;don’t have a significant performance difference&lt;/a&gt;, so my testing here should give you a good idea of what to expect from that model. You can also buy a model with a Core i7-10610U, 16GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Ftravelmate-p6-professional-laptop-tmp614-51-g2-75a5%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com%26internal_medium%3Dreferral%26internal_campaign%3DCLM%26internal_content%3DNX.VNNAA.002&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99&lt;/a&gt;. Both configurations run Windows 10 Pro and include a 1920 x 1080 non-touch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKbmhP"&gt;For my office workload of emails, spreadsheets, Zoom calls, etc., the TravelMate did just fine. I sometimes heard the fans spinning at times when my load wasn’t super heavy, but the noise wasn’t loud enough to be a problem. Note that this processor has Intel’s UHD graphics, rather than its upgraded Iris Xe graphics, which means the system wouldn’t be a good choice for gaming, video software, or other graphics work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aE7rMX"&gt;But there’s one area where the TravelMate really impressed, and it’s one that’s quite useful for travelers: battery life. Running through my daily workload at 200 nits of brightness, my system averaged nine hours and 15 minutes of continuous use. That’s almost twice what the budget Aspire 5 got with my same workload. It also beats the Swift 5 and the pricier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;. If your workload is similar to (or lighter than) mine, you should be able to bring this device around an airport or conference for a full work day without being attached to a wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Travelmate P6 seen open from the front. The screen displays a blue and yellow pattern on a black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxlyeWniBL4LoS_4QJWS31gcrxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310320/akrales_210212_4404_0132.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The notebook can charge up to 50 percent in less than 45 minutes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1fOxof"&gt;One performance complaint, though: this thing comes with bloatware. My unit was pre-installed with all kinds of junk, including games (Amazon was pinned to the taskbar) and other software like Dropbox. Most annoyingly, it came with Norton, which bugged me with annoying pop-ups all the time and also seemed to impact battery life: the TravelMate consistently lasted around an hour longer after I uninstalled the program. It doesn’t take too long to uninstall everything, but I’m still morally put off by the idea of so much cheap crapware being loaded onto a laptop that costs over $1,000. And it’s especially troubling to see on a business laptop, because it can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.kaspersky.com%2Fresource-center%2Fdefinitions%2Fwhat-is-bloatware&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22339981%2Facer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expose users to cybersecurity risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeMNxV"&gt;The TravelMate line is filling a pretty specific niche, and it fills it just fine. If you’re a frequent business traveler who needs a light device with plentiful ports and all-day battery life, you’re shopping in the $1,199 price range, and you’re willing to overlook a mediocre touchpad, dim 16:9 display, and other hiccups, then the P6 will be a better choice for you than something like a pricier and heavier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519885/dell-latitude-9510-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell Latitude&lt;/a&gt; or the shorter-lived and port-starved ThinkPad X1 Nano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Acer Travelmate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B8rAJJN0_6Z35H4i8PvQCg-9uYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310317/akrales_210212_4404_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MicroSD slot, USB-A, Ethernet, lock slot on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Acer Travelmate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_-xjON34R-xfaD0cocucyoLWPnU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310316/akrales_210212_4404_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audio jack, HDMI, USB-A, USB-C, and power port on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqF02K"&gt;That said, the P6 has enough drawbacks that I think the bulk of customers would be better served by other laptops. Those who like the Acer brand may like some of Acer’s other offerings — especially those who don’t need the business-specific security features. The Swift 5 is lighter, nicer-looking, and more affordable than the TravelMate, with a better touchpad, screen, and processor. And budget shoppers can find much of what the TravelMate offers in any number of cheaper laptops. The Aspire 5 and the Swift 3 don’t have the TravelMate’s battery or port selection, but they do improve upon its touchpad, audio (in the Aspire’s case), and looks (in the Swift’s case). And, of course, there’s a litany of other laptops in this price range — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP’s Spectre x360&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell’s XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; — that are excellent in almost every way and also offer 3:2 screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MpIMSB"&gt;Ultimately, the TravelMate isn’t a bad laptop — but if it’s the best laptop for you, you probably know who you are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer logo on the lid of the Acer Travelmate P6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_ok43uBmQv3_PIKmEnpjuOaWa0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22310323/akrales_210212_4404_0155.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s long-lasting but mediocre in other ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFBmGr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 19th, 2021 12:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy has the PS5 model, which includes a disc drive available for purchase at $499.99. Due to the high demand of the console, Best Buy is releasing small waves of stock every few minutes for purchase. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J7uq4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony’s PlayStation 5 is available at Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339786/ps5-sony-playstation-5-best-buy-restock"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMrzmx"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been quite challenging to find ever since its launch in November. And when it is available, sales have been, for the most part, limited to online-only, with stock selling out almost instantly. Despite this, we here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are dedicated to helping you keep track of when and where the PS5 is available in the hopes you can get another shot at buying Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD3Drq"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy either the PS5 (with a disc drive) or the PS5 Digital Edition, as well as any bundles that are not price surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAoRYi"&gt;Keep in mind that due to the high demand of this console, supply will not last long, with inventory selling out typically less than an hour after being made available. Nevertheless, we’ll do our best to keep this article updated with the latest in-stock alerts and tell you when the most recent restock was available at the retailers selling the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ca5R3n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"How the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Spcnqk"&gt;Where can I buy a PS5 right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JG5DCV"&gt;Due to the pandemic, most retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734517183541536443#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, will only sell the console online until further notice. We see restocks happening multiple times in the week from various retailers; most notably, we have seen frequent restocks recently appear at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2F11108140.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in particular. If you are looking for a bundle, retailers like Antonline and Newegg are likely to sell PS5 bundles instead of the actual console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjSIu6"&gt;We have noticed that restocks for the console are more likely to happen later in the week as opposed to earlier in the week. Additionally, places like Newegg are combatting the demand for this console by doing a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle%3Fnm_mc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26cm_mmc%3DAFC-RAN-COM%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_source%3Dafc-Vox%2BMedia%26AFFID%3D3430747%26AFFNAME%3DVox%2BMedia%26ACRID%3D1%26ASUBID%3Dverge%26ASID%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.theverge.com%252F%26ranMID%3D44583%26ranEAID%3D3430747%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-XXgkPukHSHvtb9QuMXSZWQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which randomly selects winners interested in buying sought-after products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V99T63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7oDuAk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yaigG6Zpq6Ebg4PHlmyTd-pJL2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21990376/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every PS5 comes with one DualSense controller, but you can use the DualShock 4 controller, but it is only limited to when you’re playing PS4 games on the next-gen console. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3N05Q"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the PS5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i98dsO"&gt;The PS5 includes all the basic things you need to get started (minus the games, of course). However, you might want to consider picking up additional accessories to ensure you get the most out of your brand-new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UsvWd"&gt;First, there’s the controller. Every new PS5 includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense&lt;/a&gt; controller. But there are a few benefits to owning at least one additional controller, such as if you plan to play local co-op games with a friend or family member. Or, if you are like me and want to keep playing your game but don’t want to be tethered to the charging cable, a second control lets you continue playing while the other one charges. Normally, $70, we have &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/sony-sony-ps5-dual-sense-white-sony-dual-sense-wireless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen the controller go down as low as $60&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MF1y0f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PwJaY2"&gt;The PS5 HD Camera is a neat accessory for people interested in using their PS5 to live-stream video games or broadcast their gameplay with friends.  It includes dual 1080p lenses and allows you to remove the background of your camera’s feed and replace it with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XqsPQY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YyqMlw"&gt;I strongly recommend subscribing to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; if you have not already done so; outside of taking advantage of some online gaming functionalities, PlayStation Plus provides a ton of additional incentives, most notably PS5 owners have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of some of the most impactful titles to release on the PS4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vVuP0t"&gt;The PS5 comes with a 825GB of available storage right now and unfortunately, there’s no way to expand the fast internal storage currently. Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Playstation-Portable-External-STGD4000400/dp/B076826S5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is available at Best Buy [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="bJx4Fx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 19th, 2021 1:06 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy is not out of stock of the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivqFA7"&gt;If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you want another shot at trying to buy Sony’s next-gen console, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735351806322286386#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 with the disc drive&lt;/a&gt; right now for $500, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ8ICJ"&gt;It is important to note that Best Buy is releasing small waves of stock every few minutes to maintain the high demand for this console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igu8hA"&gt;If you are one of the lucky ones to secure your unit in the latest restocks, I have a few suggestions on some additional items you may want to buy. You’ll likely want to buy some games for your new console. The PS5 is home to some of the most popular titles right now, such as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fassassins-creed-valhalla%2F11105646.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the 2020 remake of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fdemons-souls%2F11108202.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some other fun games like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sackboy-Big-Adventure-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC64CNF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sackboy: A Big Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZhEGF8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="q9bLmP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc7wl1"&gt;If you plan to share this console with family and want to play local co-op games, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra controller&lt;/a&gt; is a must-buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yurQ39"&gt;Some games require an online subscription to play, so &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a good purchase. But you’re not just paying to play most games (excluding free-to-play titles) online, as PS5 users with an active PS Plus subscription also have access to a digital library of PS4 classics thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPmYRp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HRiiTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7bsyby"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China cracks down on use of Tesla vehicles, citing privacy concerns </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-AUTOMOBILE-MANUFACTURING-TESLA-US" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/za4X00rPRbDNHkRjY66X0-iep80=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68994071/1192349155.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HB8mQ3"&gt;China is prohibiting its military and government personnel from using Tesla vehicles, citing a potential security risk posed by the electric automaker’s data collection, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=mhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SgCUN"&gt;People who work for the military, “state-owned enterprises in sensitive industries,” and other government agencies will be barred from driving a Tesla, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; says, citing sources with knowledge of the crackdown. The decision came after a “security review” flagged the ability of Tesla’s exterior cameras to constantly record footage. China’s government is concerned that those images can be sent back to the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Eh2XE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s exterior cameras were cited in a security review&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ly1gEc"&gt;Tesla is the latest company to get caught up in the simmering trade feud between the US and China, as the two countries met this week to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/politics/china-blinken-sullivan.html"&gt;resume trade negotiations&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the country’s embrace of Tesla and its electric vehicle manufacturing, China President Xi Jinping has sought to move his country away from foreign technology in the interest of promoting domestic enterprises. The decision against Tesla seems to mirror US restrictions against Chinese companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257675/trump-extends-huawei-ban-may-2021-china-us-android-google-telecom"&gt;including smartphone maker Huawei&lt;/a&gt;, which it deems a potential security risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFUtrV"&gt;It also could complicate Tesla’s growth in China, considering how government decisions tend to resonate throughout other industries. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252765/tesla-profit-q4-2020-earnings-elon-musk-record-sales"&gt;Tesla had its first profitable year in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, thanks in large part to the company’s popularity in the country. China is the largest market for electric vehicles in the world, and Tesla is the top seller of EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkvZWt"&gt;Producing cars in China has long been a goal of Tesla’s. The company first confirmed that it was in talks with the Chinese government to open a factory there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/22/15855060/tesla-china-factory-talks-production-eletric-cars"&gt;in the summer of 2017&lt;/a&gt;. China even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17553094/tesla-china-gigafactory-cars-deal-agreement"&gt;relaxed its rules&lt;/a&gt; regarding foreign manufacturers to give Tesla more leeway. Other major manufacturers, like GM and Ford, already produce cars in China under the joint venture rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5fAsI"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment (the company recently dissolved its press relations office), though Tesla did refer the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;to a previous statement it has made regarding its data collection. “Tesla’s privacy protection policy complies with Chinese laws and regulations,” the company said. “Tesla attaches great importance to the protection of users’ privacy.” It also said in-car cameras aren’t turned on for all Tesla vehicles in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eajbj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5M7AB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
