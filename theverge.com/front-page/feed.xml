    <title>Google Assistant can now be used to schedule your smart lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wmvXKjv8lxiNouqRsLWweuhqOH8=/540x0:2340x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67846291/Hero_image_of_new_Smart_Display_visual_experience.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qurrIr"&gt;Google Assistant now lets users schedule lights and other devices to turn on and off at specific times with its “scheduled actions” feature, according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/22/google-assistant-now-knows-how-schedule-lights-on-or-off/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which cites &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/scheduling#supported_traits"&gt;Google Assistant developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzxQVN"&gt;Google Assistant has worked with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412324/google-assistant-gentle-sleep-wake-up-philips-hue-lights"&gt;Hue and other smart lights&lt;/a&gt; for some time, to turn them on and off and to set alarms, but now you can tell your Assistant exactly when you want to turn on lights and other devices in a smart home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsFa93"&gt;One caveat: you have to be really specific if you want to schedule the lights (or other devices) to turn on or off a day in the future. Just saying something like, “Hey Google, turn the lights on tomorrow at 8PM,” isn’t enough. You’d need to say, “Hey Google, turn on the lights Tuesday at 8PM.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feOPwS"&gt;However, as &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; noted, you can specify “sunrise” and “sunset” as times to set your lights to come on (or off) and you won’t need to state the exact time. You also can use Google Assistant to schedule a length of time to keep lights on, such as “turn on lights for 10 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qd6wP"&gt;The feature is apparently still a work in progress, however; in addition to the “tomorrow” quirk, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/jxsabz/the_google_assistant_can_now_schedule_lights_on/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; note that the function to cancel a scheduled action doesn’t appear to work. But according to Google Assistant smart home documentation, it looks like these features are likely to be working soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmBmfW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6MbF5CQyjuHRwnicglx_NCBGiY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67798744/dbohn_201004_4227_0009.0.9.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Speaker deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRx7v2iKWDhr2lI1LUX0smT9vN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208402/dseifert_190915_3647_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sono’s portable Move speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3TO80R"&gt;Sonos has slashed the prices on several of its speakers ahead of Black Friday. Three of its popular models are $100 off right now, a savings of up to 25 percent. You can buy the Sonos Move, the company’s first portable speaker, for just $300 right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="APQVzv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T5kD09"&gt;If you are looking for a soundbar, the Sonos Beam is an excellent starting point. Aside from enhancing the sound quality of games and movies, the Beam has always-listening mics and supports two voice assistants: Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8VDcdO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCcxn5"&gt;If you own a Sonos speaker but want to enhance your sound when watching movies or playing music at the family barbecue, the Sonos Sub will add an extra low-end thump to your Sonos speaker. Normally, this add-on would set you back $700, but you can buy it for just $600 at a few retailers, including Amazon and Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zCuuw7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="of9IqM"&gt;Headphone deals&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="61vp5x"&gt;You can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose’s excellent Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones&lt;/a&gt; for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q4QK379?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213175001080094" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1475153-REG%2Fbose_794297_0100_headphones_700_noise_cancelling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F6b3f#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. The price is only available in “soapstone white,” unfortunately, at all these retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IxWjk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYOJJg"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;amp;cjevent=bf1dd84529dc11eb814400030a24060c&amp;amp;utm_source=Vox+Media" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are $190 at Woot right now&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest we’ve seen yet on Apple’s flagship earbuds. Compared to the standard AirPods, the Pro model features better sound quality and noise cancellation, plus support for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULP9BI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AhnjK1"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds are down to just $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best price we’ve seen for this model, which usually costs $150 outside of any discounts. Compared to the standard Galaxy Buds, this upgraded model that launched alongside the Galaxy S20 series of phones has improved sound quality, microphones, and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5zWQ0"&gt;If you are looking to buy two pairs of Galaxy Buds Plus, Best Buy has a few bundles, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213386876980609" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;allowing you to buy sets for only $200&lt;/a&gt;. You can mix and match which color you want for both pairs and are available in blue, black, light blue, red, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wo6p68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581901" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArxGby"&gt;Alongside the Plus wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are discounted at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally, these earbuds would cost $130, but you can get them for $70 at either retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttnzGj"&gt;Unfortunately, the color options are limited at both retailers, so you can only buy these earbuds in either black or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o58dM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586872"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ISaGBC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fjabra-100-99090000-nrc-in-ear-titanium%2Fp%2F0TH-04CN-000K5%3FItem%3D9SIAFWTB5S7462%26cm_sp%3DDailydeal_SS-_-9SIAFWTB5S7462-_-11202020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt; has a deal right now on the Jabra Elite 75t wireless earbuds. You can buy a pair of these earbuds in refurbished condition for just $85. These wireless earbuds feature a new design compared to its predecessor and improve on the battery life and sound quality. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iPad Pro (2020 model).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmyLtf"&gt;If you are looking to pick up an iPad Pro this Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=59b2301a303437a19ef23fb2e3fafd22&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578293673083745" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have Apple’s high-end iPad Pro for $730. This model includes an 11-inch display and a 128GB storage configuration. If 128GB is not enough storage space for you, both retailers are taking $100 off the 256GB configuration, bringing the price down to $800, which is what you would normally pay if you bought the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro with the lowest storage configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GJf6F5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zbPVaT"&gt;Wearable deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/big8WY8b6LcdHotTnUDvSFOpf2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21926117/dseifert_200930_4218_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyzhPO"&gt;If you like Fitbit’s wearables and prefer to have a smartwatch by the company, you can get the Fitbit Sense smartwatch for $280 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724580973739712242" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1590667-REG%2Ffitbit_fb512bkbk_sense_gps_smartwatch_carbon.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model costs $330 and allows you to track your stress levels and measure your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAW1Mh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlkbsX"&gt;The Apple Watch SE was already the most affordable Watch that Apple made at $279, but it’s even cheaper at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578867741826427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can score the 40mm GPS version for $259 or the larger 44mm Watch for $289 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=e39bfa3f763e4fa56204c59a62303c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578918898824263" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Each size looks similar to the more expensive Series 6 but lacks the always-on display and a few other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Widfy"&gt;The Apple Watch SE aligns more with the Series 5 in terms of specs, but at $259, it’s a fantastic value. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;Here’s an in-depth post&lt;/a&gt; on how the SE differs from other recent Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="imKmLJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffa5rt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6 is also cheaper than usual at Amazon and Walmart. Normally $400 for the 40mm GPS model, it’s down to $330 — but there’s a catch. You must buy this model in either red or blue at Amazon and Walmart only has the red model in this size discounted right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I6L1IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BYR4vm"&gt;Smart home deals&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="65HtKg"&gt;If you have a large home and want to make sure all of the rooms in it have internet and no dead zones, Amazon and Best Buy has discounted the Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi router. You can get three units for just $479. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jg0NxI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kPHL"&gt;Ahead of Black Friday, Google has discounted several of its products, including the Nest Wifi, and you can buy a two-pack for $219. The Nest Wifi system is easy to set up, and with two units, you can cover up to 4,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RtDGBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgnwv"&gt;If you need a mesh router system that will cover more square feet in your home, you can buy a three-pack Eero 6 mesh router for $223. The mesh routers also include a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, allowing you to connect and control select devices with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dACyX2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Av0Zih"&gt;If you prefer Netgear products, you can save 22 percent on a two-pack for the company’s Nighthawk mesh router system. It’s designed for homes that have up to 400Mbps of internet speeds. Netgear says its Nighthawk mesh router system provides up to 3,000 square feet in coverage and support for 25 or more devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wX8NXq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603472"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q2G2wV"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Alarm-8-piece-kit/dp/B085RCLP9Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=8c21d9388b42892a758895a6df08cbd6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724304542635172098" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, you can save $140 on an eight-piece Ring Alarm home security kit, and it comes with a free third-gen Amazon Echo Dot with purchase. Normally $290, this kit will only cost you $150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WM5ndj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp4b3f"&gt;Circling back to Netgear, its $450 flagship mesh router system is also discounted. You can buy the Orbi RBK752 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system for $280 at Amazon or Best Buy right now. This is a great product if you need something that will have the bandwidth to stream multiple videos in 4K or 8K resolution in your house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2cCTga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603482"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T6HkwD"&gt;Samsung’s fast T7 USB-C SSD with 1TB of storage normally costs $200, but you can buy this portable SSD for just $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XN4D8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724300631221915412" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It features optional password protection with AES 256-bit encryption and Samsung claims the T7 has up to 1,050MB/s transfer speeds. It’s compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Windows 10, macOS, and Android. Unfortunately, it will not work on iPad or iOS devices and it is not compatible as an external SSD for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4ShY7X"&gt;Peak Design has kicked off its “Super Massive Black Friday sale” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F21569412%2Fblack-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with sizeable discounts on bags and tripods&lt;/a&gt;. It might be tough to imagine when you might next need a durable backpack that can fit a lot of gadgets within, but the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fcollections%2Feveryday-bags%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F21569412%2Fblack-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Everyday” lineup of bags is 20 percent off&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fcollections%2Ftravel-bags%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F21569412%2Fblack-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bigger “Travel” bags are also discounted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PrH58"&gt;If you’re into photography, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fcollections%2Ftripods&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F21569412%2Fblack-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Peak Design’s Travel Tripod and a few accessories&lt;/a&gt; that are compatible with it are cheaper than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VDyIWJ"&gt;Gaming deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0C6Bsc8ReKgT0rv3pfhFIiSt04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20079033/Watch_Dogs_Legion_StreetArtist_vignette_Light.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Blx9fM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, the latest installment in Ubisoft’s hack-anything, open-world game, &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fwatch-dogs-legion-standard-edition%2F5cec2d5839798c0870c07698.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;is down to $45 at Ubisoft’s official website&lt;/a&gt;, that’s $15 off, while it’s not the lowest we have seen this game go down, this title recently came out and this is still a good discount. What makes this deal even better is that each version will net you an upgrade to the Xbox Series X / S or PS5 copies for free. Even if you don’t have much interest in the game, it’s an affordable way to check out what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556197/xbox-series-s-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion"&gt;impressive ray-tracing graphics&lt;/a&gt; look like on the new console hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SZ4g2C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581295"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvFCDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most popular PS4 games released this year. If you have yet to experience Naughty Dog’s latest title, you can pick it up for $30 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Us-Part-II-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJRFSDF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=fc2d003cd4936f885db857399379224b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724302857718714066" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fthe-last-of-us-part-ii%2F11097389.html%3Fcondition%3DPre-Owned" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest price the game has been marked down to date. If you recently purchased a PS5, you can also play this game via backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="20AIbx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mRedx"&gt;Speaking of popular PS4 games that released this year, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is also on sale at its lowest price ever of $40 at Amazon and Best Buy. Even better? If you purchased a PS5, you can transfer your save data from your PS4 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553494/sony-playstation-5-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-digital-foundry"&gt;experience the game in 60 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, a feature exclusive to Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XG8KV1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Oyb4M"&gt;If you’re having trouble narrowing down what games you want, why not get several? &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fvideo-game-software%2F-%2FN-fhju6%3FNao%3D0&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target is hosting a “get three for the price of two”&lt;/a&gt; deal on video game purchases — even for newer titles like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, to name a few. The list goes on, though one thing that isn’t eligible are first-party Sony games for the PS5, like the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;remake, but you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Godfall, &lt;/em&gt;which is available on Sony’s next-gen console (and on PC.) Even &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; a game coming out next month is eligible for this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0oBNwJ"&gt;PC upgrade deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung 970 Evo Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1L9qvHPRI_A8JYSNHveYyQFADM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22023972/970evoplus.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image shows the 1TB model, but the 2TB model detailed below looks the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ekCZCJ"&gt;If you want 2TB of fast storage for your PC, Samsung’s 2TB 970 Evo Plus NVMe SSD is $250 at Newegg and Amazon, beating the lowest price by about $40. Over the summer, the price was steady at $350. A PCIe 3.0 M.2 SSD like this will fit in only certain kinds of motherboards (so check before you buy). Alternatively, it can also make for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to"&gt;very fast USB-C drive&lt;/a&gt; if you get an M.2 enclosure for it. Either route you take, you’ll get a lot of speedy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday mesh router deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROiHdHzzjnT5l3DPDJCGuhvTNP4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67846174/vpavic_191010_3722_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9vRnJt"&gt;If you’re looking to improve your home Wi-Fi situation, the best thing you can do is invest in a mesh router. Mesh router systems make it easy to cover all corners of your home with a strong Wi-Fi signal and are easily expandable depending on how much square footage you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1wTGS"&gt;If you have a basic home internet plan of 300Mbps or less, you can do fine with a Wi-Fi 5 based system, such as the entry-level Eero or Google’s Nest Wifi. If you have faster internet at home, up to a gigabit connection, you might want to invest in a Wi-Fi 6 system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUazze"&gt;Normally, mesh router setups can run a few hundred dollars, making them a significant quality-of-life investment. But several of our favorite systems are discounted right now for Black Friday, letting you get that Wi-Fi network upgrade for a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dLWMYu"&gt;Eero deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1j7pPQ"&gt;Amazon-owned Eero is discounting both its entry-level Wi-Fi 5 systems and the brand-new Wi-Fi 6 models. The base Eero mesh system can be purchased in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-mesh-WiFi-system/dp/B08B2M8LKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-mesh-WiFi-system/dp/B08B2M8LKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;-, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-eero-mesh-WiFi-system-3-pack-/dp/B07WMLPSRL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack&lt;/a&gt; setups, with discounts ranging from $20 to $75 off, depending on which set you choose. A three-pack is designed to cover up to 5,000 square feet and is ideal for up to 300Mbps internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTyKYp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536532"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JwayS9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Eero’s latest router system is simple to use and less expensive than before","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20912347/eero-mesh-router-wifi-system-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6IeULQ"&gt;If you are interested in the new Wi-Fi 6 Eero 6 system, you can get the base model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-6-Router/dp/B085VM9ZDD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B085WS7H6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;-, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-packs&lt;/a&gt; starting at $103. The three-pack covers up to 5,000 square feet and is good for up to 500Mbps internet service, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="csrbaL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mysRq4"&gt;For the most speed, you’ll want to pony up for the Eero 6 Pro, which can also be purchased in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-Pro-6-Router/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-Pro-6-Router/dp/B08KXCKC4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;-, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-pro-6-3-pack/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;-packs. Eero says the Pro system is designed for those with gigabit internet service, with a three-pack covering up to 6,000 square feet. It adds a third Wi-Fi band to speed up communication between the nodes and provides faster connections to your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FQTKyo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="paXUwB"&gt;Nest Wifi deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQ5NgX"&gt;Google’s Nest Wifi is a dual-band Wi-Fi 5 based system. It’s faster than the base Eero system but won’t quite keep up with the best Wi-Fi 6 systems on the market. It’s a good in-between option, however, providing easy setup, reliable connections, and fast speeds up to 500Mbps. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Wifi-Router-Generation/dp/B07YMJ57MB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-pack&lt;/a&gt; is the popular option and covers up to 4,400 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R4FNfQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZeXQXg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Wifi review: the smarter mesh router","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="nK9rEt"&gt;Netgear mesh router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Huvcpl"&gt;Like Eero, Netgear has a wide range of mesh router systems, with all the newest ones supporting Wi-Fi 6. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050501/netgear-nighthawk-mesh-wi-fi-6-router-price-specs-features-ces-2020"&gt;dual-band Nighthawk system&lt;/a&gt; is the entry-level option, with support for up to 25 devices, coverage up to 3,000 square feet, and internet speeds up to 400Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lBbp2y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603472"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y2INbj"&gt;The Orbi line is Netgear’s flagship mesh system and is designed for larger homes, more connected devices, and up to gigabit internet speeds. The Orbi models are tri-band, much like the Eero 6 Pro, and are the best options to get the fastest speeds you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwxbun"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603482"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qaTpsW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge holiday gift guide for creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9MKViL-jzREBfh7Xnj-ljX5Mp4=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67846052/VRG_4264_Creators_HGG_Lede_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gift ideas for the creators in your circle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ru9N1G"&gt;It can be said that this is a golden age for creators: there is a plethora of wonderfully imaginative art coming from a wide variety of fields like video and still photography, audio, graphics, text, and a whole mass of other arts. If you have friends or family who are professional creators (or have ambitions to become one) — or if you yourself work in a creative field — then we’ve assembled some gift ideas that could be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltlJfD"&gt;We’ve gone to our own creative staff for suggestions for what could be the perfect gift. Beginners could take advantage of an inexpensive gadget that converts HDMI to USB or a popular USB microphone that will enhance their podcasts. Videographers will need a smartphone stabilizer to keep their vlogs steady and a professional lens to add to their iPhone. And pros will want to consider Apple’s latest high-end system and display (although make sure your relatives can afford them before you put them on your gift list). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UTQaDe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9569655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Sex, Lies, and Video Games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NneV3OqqnLVgu0BbaqP8HLwAQdg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67846044/VRG_4308_Oomba_LEDE.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Oomba was a startup designed to make a lot of money from the games industry — instead, everyone played each other&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="MxdKwU"&gt;When her new boss started hitting on her, Ronnie* wondered if she might be able to take advantage of the situation. She was 23, and by now she’d figured out that when she raised the pitch of her voice and dressed like an anime fantasy girl, switching her hair from purple to green to pink every few weeks, it drove certain guys wild. Guys like the CEO of this startup, a serial entrepreneur named Michael Williams. She examined him from her desk: he was 49 and seemed rich but painfully nerdy and obsessed with&lt;em&gt; Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe if she acted all bubbly and let him stare, she could get a raise or a promotion. His crush was her opportunity.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xncprh"&gt;“I could tell he just wanted to hang out with a cute girl,” she tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsBqKu"&gt;It was the summer of 2016, and this was Ronnie’s first office gig. “I called it my big girl job,” she says. Once she saw the perks of working in tech, she didn’t want to go back to retail. After all, Claire’s had never encouraged its mall employees to play beer pong at happy hour. The startup, called Oomba, was even doing something cool: building software that could run tournaments for any game, from Scrabble to soccer to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Ronnie liked video games, especially the art, and even a few trading card games, as long as they were fair and the rules stayed consistent. Yu-Gi-Oh, for example, she couldn’t stand. A few rare cards were too powerful, rigging the outcome. And where was the fun in that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZDRQlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think Mike was delusional, that he literally thought he was going to develop the next Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Miebnt"&gt;Ronnie’s family had fled Mexico for Southern California when she was nine, after a cartel threatened to kill them if her father didn’t move drugs or at least pay a bribe. In the US, her parents worked hard, but she could relax. “My thing was just kind of partying,” she says. “A total scene kid.” At 20, she moved in with a boyfriend who became more and more domineering, until one day it escalated into a physical fight between them, and she says he picked her up by the throat and threw her. She left him, but in retrospect, Ronnie says she thinks Williams noticed she was “a damaged girl” and therefore vulnerable — that this was why he came by her desk, remembered her birthday, asked for her phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZXbIj"&gt;Two months after she started at Oomba, Williams invited her out after an office party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVyN0T"&gt;“Where are we all going?” she asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbobRT"&gt;“Shhh,” he said — he’d meant just the two of them, alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlG3SK"&gt;“Okay… yeah, sure,” Ronnie agreed. She tried to be accommodating, she tells me later. “I wanted to be his favorite, so I could stay there the longest and move up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2eLoE"&gt;Williams took Ronnie to an arcade and filled a card with points for her to play. In the flashing neon, above the clangs and hoots and whistles, he mentioned he also liked to go to strip clubs. &lt;em&gt;You like to spend money on girls&lt;/em&gt;, Ronnie thought, &lt;em&gt;so maybe you could spend some money my way&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iggeSD"&gt;Afterward, in his BMW, Williams confided that being CEO wasn’t as fun as it seemed. He spent most of his time pestering investors, he said, trying to bring in more capital with a desperation that left him feeling like “a money whore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUjpts"&gt;Ronnie looked at him and realized this was her opening. She played her card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDBike"&gt;“I’m a money whore, too,” she told him. “I sell nudes online.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVhw0f"&gt;“No way!” he said and offered her $500. It was more than the $130 she’d been charging guys on Tumblr for her collection, and more than she made in a week at Oomba. They stopped at an ATM, and she emailed him a drive of explicit photos and videos. This felt like a game she’d been playing for years. It was almost too easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3amq4"&gt;“From that point forward, I basically became his sugar baby,” she tells me. “He even said he loved me, and I kind of feel that he did. But not in a healthy way — in a controlling, manipulative kind of way.” She’d thought that Williams would be “just another john,” that Oomba would be an easy win, but the rules kept changing and catching her by surprise. One move led to another, and soon everything got out of hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MqQ-T0Yb0_MmiCj1n58z60urQRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063571/VRG_4308_Oomba_ATM.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yuQMtz"&gt;By the summer of 2018, 18 months after Williams took Ronnie to the arcade, Oomba would be over, with Williams facing internal accusations of financial mismanagement and inappropriate sexual relationships. But first, after squeezing the same investors for years, and though Oomba had zero revenue, it seems the company raised about $35 million from Chicago firm ExWorks Capital and blew through all of it in about a year. Where did the money go? No one is quite sure. There was a seven-figure splurge on a Las Vegas extravaganza featuring &lt;em&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; star Wil Wheaton that was so over budget&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the company didn’t fully pay the venue, according to a former member of management. There were chic offices, where Williams fell hundreds of thousands of dollars behind in rent. And there were a whole lot of sex workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHLxrV"&gt;I reviewed thousands of pages of documents and spoke with over 30 sources about Williams and Oomba, including investors, employees, and business partners. Most described him as narcissistic, a fast-talking salesman with a talent for separating people from their savings. He drank a lot of Red Bull and had a puerile sense of humor, asking an employee who brought her cat into work, “Can I pet your pussy?” again and again. Williams apparently didn’t like rules, couldn’t focus, and seemed unable to accept that he might ever be wrong. He could be volatile, swearing over text message (“if you don’t return my call by 5 PM you are fucking fired you fucking douche”) and chastising employees over the office PA system (“Come to my office now you dumb motherfucker”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdMGXv"&gt;And he often stretched the truth, especially when doing so enabled access to more funding or let him out of paying for something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhhMNT"&gt;“It was my feeling that he cheated investors, he cheated employees, and he cheated vendors, and he felt zero guilt about that, I mean zero,” said one C-level executive who worked at Oomba for almost three years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8usD8"&gt;(Williams refused repeated requests to speak with me, saying over text, “I hope you get all your facts straight and that you’ll spell my name correctly.”)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fa0gGQ"&gt;In some ways, the rise and fall of Oomba is so outlandish that it competes with the worst startup horror stories. Williams was allegedly dating three employees at a time. He raised over $250,000 on Kickstarter and never followed through on the project for which the money was meant. He pledged $400,000 in college sponsorships and only gave a quarter of it. He claimed that magician Penn Jillette and Atari founder Nolan Bushnell had invested in Oomba, something both men deny — though Bushnell is a friend who held &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/0805/08053545.pdf"&gt;a formal role&lt;/a&gt; at one of Williams’ previous startups, which was called, almost unfathomably, Reality Gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ruXhx"&gt;“NBA stars were going to get involved, and Kobe Bryant would put in a million,” one Oomba investor recalls. “I think Mike was delusional, that he literally thought he was going to develop the next Facebook, but at some point, when he realized he wasn’t, he started lying.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbDHJn"&gt;Bushnell, who has his own history of alleged inappropriate sexual behavior, is more forgiving. He describes Williams as “probably the most optimistic guy I’ve ever met,” and says he has no hard feelings about being falsely named in press releases as Oomba’s chief visionary officer, adding, “A lot of times, the difference between an optimist and a scoundrel is nuance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NqIvJH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He was wearing a suit two sizes too big and had a hole in the bottom of his shoe”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EiPdpY"&gt;Paychecks came late, if at all. Invoices went unpaid.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A $100,000 loan agreement was scanned and emailed without signatures, giving Williams cover to deny the loan had happened at all. And after four years, the company’s core product was never able to do what it said it was supposed to: work with any game. It’s possible this was because many of Oomba’s engineers were college students whom Williams apparently sometimes paid in free food and the promise of stock options. Or maybe, a few employees suggest, he preferred to keep the software unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQw28u"&gt;“There’s glitches and glitches and glitches, but he didn’t want it to work. He wanted it to stay almost done, to raise more money from investors,” one senior-level employee believes. “I told people really early, ‘Listen, this is what it is. Just shut up and get paid while we’re getting paid.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IO4XkF"&gt;This was a common attitude at Oomba: grab the money hose and hold on before it all ran out. It’s almost hard to blame them. Why not try to catch some of that $35 million as it fell? I’ve done the same myself with other startups. Maybe you have, too. There’s little order or fairness in what gets funded and, of course, no justice whatsoever in who has the wealth to invest in a startup to begin with. Capitalism is capricious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8yIcP"&gt;But how did Oomba manage to raise so much in the first place? Well, versatile tournament software is apparently a good idea and something that still hasn’t quite been done. When the company was founded in 2013, game-adjacent investments were prescient — before Twitch, the streaming platform, and Discord, the messaging service, got big. Competitive video game play, or esports, was taking off as a spectator sport in Asia. And of course, Williams is a white man who was trying to raise capital in the era of peak startup, a six-year period when the total amount invested by venture capital firms more than tripled: from $41.3 billion in 2012 to $140.2 billion in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhz1MZ"&gt;So the story of Oomba is also the story of the average startup: most fail. At least half go out of business within four years. That’s usually the point for people who fund early-stage software companies: riskier investments in the hopes that a few will pan out spectacularly. And with great risk comes the occasional Oomba. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDgMNi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVipSSexIQZEZ-0ebn0gnwq1uSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063444/Oomba_Money_Linebreak_Blackout.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bLnZHc"&gt;Michael Williams started raising money for Oomba in 2012 and 2013. By his side was a blond actress, Dylan Hundley, who starred in the Oscar-nominated 1990 film &lt;em&gt;Metropolitan&lt;/em&gt;. The unlikely duo found an audience on the East Coast when a finance guy saw the pitch deck and brought it to his golf club buddies in Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc4JDI"&gt;“He presented it as, ‘I get pitched all the time, over a long career, and this is one of the best concepts I’ve been presented with,’” explains one friend. The finance guy said Oomba was a hundred-bagger, or maybe a thousand-bagger, meaning they’d get back a thousand times their investment. To seal the deal, Williams and Hundley came to the golf club — a lush expanse dotted with white birch and sycamores — for cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, and a Powerpoint in a private room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jt8JP"&gt;“There was a lot of enthusiasm, and everyone fed off each other,” one golf club member tells me. Williams didn’t quite impress — “He was wearing a suit two sizes too big and had a hole in the bottom of his shoe,” — but Hundley made up for it: “She was a very attractive woman, and she had been in the movies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2L5Pn4"&gt;A few years earlier, Hundley had done some consulting for Williams when he was CEO at Reality Gap. Having already spent $7 million in investor funding, he paid her using money meant for payroll taxes; as a result, the board fired him. Now here she was, helping him secure new backers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSyd5f"&gt;One of the investors, Paul Rotondo, agreed the golfers were smitten with Hundley and therefore with Oomba: “The fellas at the club, they’re kind of all hornbags,” he says. “Your eyes glaze over. It’s a big frickin’ dream, you find something like this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqMUpn"&gt;Around 20 members of the golf club invested. Several brought in family and other friends. The finance guy got his ex-wife involved. Some people didn’t have the savings necessary to be accredited investors, but Williams helped “fudge” the paperwork, as one person put it. On an early shareholders’ call, Williams announced Oomba had “tens of thousands of users,” though the real number of accounts was more like 450. Expectations were high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ1p78"&gt;Rotondo says one golf buddy “was of the opinion that our group could buy some kind of airplane that we could share” when Oomba hit it big. “He had this money spent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HJr2oGjeRa98h5ibjQ65X_ofcN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063574/VRG_4308_Oomba_Spree.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6NxWzj"&gt;Meanwhile, in California, a college sophomore named Tyler Hogan met Williams at a midnight &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; tournament during the fall of 2013. When Williams saw his University of California, Irvine sweatshirt and learned Hogan was studying computer science, he offered him an internship on the spot. Hogan is pale and towheaded, with soft features and trusting blue eyes. He was intrigued. “What’s the worst that could happen? I’m just getting experience,” he said. That spring, Hogan brought Williams to his video game development club at UCI. At least four additional students got hired. For a while, this was Oomba’s entire engineering team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na7EFL"&gt;The college kids came in on evenings and weekends, even pulling all-nighters at the office. But Williams seemed determined to distract them. He insisted on adding streaming, stretching resources to form OombaTV. He set up promotional tournaments before the software was ready, announcing after one that over 200,000 people had watched — Google Analytics only showed 1,995 viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3nHMs"&gt;“It was always like, ‘Oh, quickly add this one fix in to make the tournament work for this weekend!’” Hogan says. “We were never taking the time to think through how this would work for hundreds of thousands of people at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igHl3J"&gt;As simple as digital brackets may sound, not all tournaments look like March Madness. Complications arise around scoring, teams, and elimination. But Oomba apparently ignored the tech dictum to design at scale. The company spent years writing code tailored to whatever kind of tournament it would be running next, without ever achieving a universal solution that could be customized.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o1FElv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I never did quite understand what he was trying to do, other than trying to make money off the investors” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew0ewM"&gt;The limits of this strategy became clear by August 2014 when Oomba debuted at Gen Con, the annual 60,000-person gathering focused on “tabletop games,” meaning roleplaying games (like &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt;), collectable card games (like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;), and board games (like Clue). These are the games that Williams loves, but they were not the priority of investors. Tabletop has grown in the past decade — driven by megahits like Cards Against Humanity and Catan — and in 2018, the category brought in $11.95 billion worldwide. But that same year, video games made over ten times more: $138.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QHl6T"&gt;At Gen Con 2014, Oomba was supposed to run a Catan tournament and a Guinness World Record-setting tournament of rock, paper, scissors. It was chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UEM8M"&gt;“Everybody was just at the edge of their wits, super stressed, not getting enough sleep,” Hogan recalls. “The software was like half running it, but it was kind of falling over in a lot of places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzACop"&gt;By the end, Oomba was banned from exhibiting at the convention in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7zDOq"&gt;Larry Roznai, who was in charge of Catan as the president of Mayfair Games, says that in spite of months of promises, Oomba’s software couldn’t handle a Catan tournament. “At the end of the day, there was nothing functional behind it,” he tells me, adding that Mayfair never paid Williams a cent. “I never did quite understand what he was trying to do, other than trying to make money off the investors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXv2JE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_7Gt-AUyJ3g2mp9HJm62sFLavCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063445/Oomba_Heels_Linebreak_Blackout.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Pqggae"&gt;After Gen Con, Williams decided he wanted a place where Oomba could host tournaments, and he chose two storefronts — one for tabletop and one for video games — in the Laguna Hills Mall, a cursed-feeling place that was set to close in a few years. Rent was cheap. Foot traffic was low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8KbNV"&gt;One afternoon, the team returned to the office to find someone changing the locks. So Oomba’s employees relocated everything to a cinder-brick storage space at the mall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vdhn2V"&gt;For about a year, this was Oomba’s home base. In the winter, it got so cold that Hogan wore his furry snowboarding jacket and kept a space heater under his desk. The demand from heaters and computers sometimes overloaded the circuits, cutting power to the room and sending everyone home. Many of the employees quit. Those who stayed were mostly in college and didn’t need the money — seeing as paychecks rarely came. “It would be like, ‘Hey, it’s Friday, let’s go to Buffalo Wild Wings!’, and we’d know intuitively that means we’re not getting a paycheck today,” Hogan says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBIJLE"&gt;On the other side of the cinder bricks, Yelp reviewers complained the esports-oriented Oomba Lounge was disorganized, with rude staff and computers that often broke. “Do NOT take your kids here,” wrote Rainbow K. in July 2015. “They only want to take your money.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvwr5y"&gt;Williams emailed investors that fall, asking for more funding and saying deals with Hasbro, &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt;, and the South By Southwest festival were in the works. “We are talking about a global RISKⓇ tournament! 12 year-old Mike is loving this!!” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfoXoT"&gt;But as the months wore on, the folks in Connecticut grew antsy. Williams and Hundley, who was living in New York, kept calling the golf club members looking for more money each quarter: $20,000 here, $23,000 there. “He knew the people who invested a lot, we were the ones with the most liability, so we would invest more,” one golf club member tells me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo4Dc2"&gt;With all this financing, Williams didn’t seem to care about revenue, let alone profit. “He truly does not have any idea at all about the value of the dollar,” claims one person who has worked with Williams on and off. “He spends money whether he has it or not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uL381e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Williams called her his “unicorn”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igUUKC"&gt;So in early 2016, Williams started looking into buying a chain of restaurant-arcades called GameWorks. GameWorks began in the late ‘90s as a joint venture between DreamWorks, Sega, and Universal Studios, with input from Steven Spielberg. Much had changed since then, including a few bankruptcies and restructurings. At his first meeting with GameWorks’ chairman Howard Brand, over lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan Beach, Williams wore a black-and-white striped referee’s jacket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK38CJ"&gt;“I thought he was a little eccentric. Typically when I go to these meetings I’m dressed pretty nice,” Brand says. “From my point of view, I didn’t really care, as long as he paid the price.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdCQ0S"&gt;Howard Brand looks like George Costanza from &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; but has serious business acumen — the kind of guy who flips companies in trucking, health care, and scrap metal recycling. He led the purchase of GameWorks from Sega in 2011 and began learning the complexities of the family entertainment center space. “There’s so many parts to it that you have to know: gaming, party, food and beverage,” Brand explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znjTNV"&gt;His son, an enterprising gamer named Michael, was finishing college and convinced his father that GameWorks should get in early on esports. Howard was skeptical but allowed the younger Brand to build out dedicated esports lounges in three of GameWorks’ eight locations, where he began hosting video game tournaments that attracted several hundred players and spectators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJRhlb"&gt;“People would line up in the heat to come in. It was amazing. I didn’t realize how big it was,” Howard says with pride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQ79V8"&gt;But even though GameWorks had&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;advanced gaming PCs, the tournaments were run on spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4q5C6Q"&gt;This was where Oomba would come in. “If you have software to automate the process, it would improve the experience for the average gamer,” Michael Brand says. Williams put in an offer to buy GameWorks, and he and Howard negotiated a deal. But Williams didn’t deliver the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjYgSr"&gt;“We gave Mike Williams four or five months,” Howard says, and he couldn’t come up with anything more than a few nonrefundable deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J10Cfv"&gt;“My mentality was, it’s not going to happen,” Michael Brand says. You can’t pay for a company with enthusiasm. Silly costumes aside, if Williams was the kind of guy who had no follow-through, then that wasn’t going to change, no matter how many extensions he got. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIQq7K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVipSSexIQZEZ-0ebn0gnwq1uSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063444/Oomba_Money_Linebreak_Blackout.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HCWKzb"&gt;By the time Ronnie started at Oomba, in the late summer of 2016, the company had around two dozen employees spread across a two-story building in a low-slung office park with glass-walled conference rooms, a kitchen, and even a shower. Williams spent thousands on height-adjustable desks but sometimes didn’t pay the company’s health insurance bill; an employee once called a doctor’s office to schedule an appointment only to discover the policy was inactive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AL0pU"&gt;“I got my first paycheck when I was supposed to get my second, and I got my second when I was supposed to get my third, and from then on after every paycheck was over a month late, so after eight months, I couldn’t financially do it,” one employee tells me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5kYh6"&gt;People would quit all the time, and new people would get brought in. One executive left after having multiple vertigo spells, including one in the fast lane on the freeway, that he says were from the stress of working at Oomba. Multiple women left after they alleged Williams said something inappropriate or asked them out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3Osf4"&gt;“He tried to test the water like that with me, being friendly, and I was never receiving of it,” one woman says. “I put up my wall. And then once I did that, he started treating me a little bit differently” — less friendly, more making fun of her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uYL4N"&gt;But Ronnie was different: eager for cash and comfortable selling access to her body. Williams called her his “unicorn.” Barely a week after she first sent him photos, Williams took her to Las Vegas and bought Ronnie $2,000 worth of lingerie at La Perla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4rnFI"&gt;“And afterwards, as a payment, he’s like, what are you going to do? So I masturbated in front of him,” she says. “He even got me my own room, and it was the nicest room that I’ve ever seen, at the Greek-themed hotel.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FypvYE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was like, I have a pretty sweet situation here. Why would I want to fuck it up?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8bwIa"&gt;Caesars Palace was interested in partnering with Oomba on turning some of the property’s bars into esports lounges. “Caesars is the leader in live entertainment, but MGM owns sports, so if esports was going to become a battleground on The Strip, we wanted to throw our hat in the ring,” explains a former member of Caesars management. (Caesars Entertainment declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fF5SuJ"&gt;While Williams was in meetings, Ronnie posted about their Vegas getaway on Facebook, where she was friends with a few people in the office. When they got back, the HR manager called Ronnie in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcgDIR"&gt;“Nothing weird ever happened,” Ronnie told her. She didn’t want to lose the job, she tells me. “I was like, I have a pretty sweet situation here. Why would I want to fuck it up?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvDOrH"&gt;She and Williams settled into a routine: dates twice a month for $500 each, shopping sprees, and trips to the Taboo Gentlemen’s Club, about a 15-minute drive from Disneyland. Inside, women slowly got naked on a red-lit stage while Williams and Ronnie watched from leopard-print banquettes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwna73"&gt;“He would give me money to throw on cute girls dancing,” Ronnie says. “Girls would see him with me and therefore that would make them comfortable, and I would even say, ‘He’s so rich! He paid for my shoes.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF7vJO"&gt;Ronnie soon learned that Williams already had multiple sugar babies, many of whom worked at strip clubs. Dates were prearranged to avoid scheduling conflicts. “All these girls saw me as a threat,” she explains. “The more money he gave me, the less for them.” But because Ronnie refused to actually touch Williams, she was happy to let other women be more hands-on. She herself was still seeing other guys. Ronnie’s lack of interest in having sex with him seemed to only make Williams like her more, just as the investors in Connecticut continued to send Williams check after check, with a desire for success that only deepened as the goal appeared increasingly out of reach.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDYw1Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “Whatever he promises you, ignore him”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4pU8n8"&gt;In mid-December, Williams went to New York to raise more money, and he brought along Ronnie, who had never been to the East Coast. “I was so excited,” she says. “We stayed right on the square” — that is, Times Square. Her parents, believing she’d be participating in important work, were delighted. Instead, after his meetings, Williams, Ronnie, and Hundley, the actress, headed to the upscale clothing store Reformation where Williams spent thousands of dollars on clothes. Ronnie and Williams then went alone to a second Reformation across Manhattan to get a certain top that wasn’t available in the first one. There, he bought her even more: a red long-sleeved dress, a printed pantsuit, a pleated skirt, vegan shoes — about 15 items total. Next, the pair headed to a comic book store and a Japanese market for more gifts: fluffy gray sock-slippers, a sweater dress, volumes 1-3 of a &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; comic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw7xVP"&gt;The trip culminated, of course, in a visit to a strip club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1YyEF"&gt;“I got super fucking wasted,” Ronnie says. “He wanted to go to a back room, and to get a back room, you need to spend money and pay for champagne.” She and Williams each picked out a dancer they liked and headed for a private room, where Ronnie soon asked the women if they would mind if she got in her underwear as well. They told her to go for it. “I remember being like, ‘I’m really drunk, I need to pee,’ and they let me use the girls’ bathroom, the working girls’ bathroom.” She saw a sign that said something like, “Whatever he promises you, ignore him,” and laughed. She approached the sink and the mirror. “I washed my hands and I look at myself like, ‘Wow, I’m really fucked up.’” She stumbled back to the room and had a little more to drink. Feeling woozy, she announced she was going to lie down and take a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VItZjG"&gt;When she woke up, her bra was off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2WcMs"&gt;She was disoriented because she didn’t remember removing it. “Did I take it off?” she says. Up until this moment, Ronnie had been having fun, amassing free clothes and drinks and new experiences, but now she felt overwhelmed. She turned to find Williams, across the room with both strippers on top of him, making out with one and then the other. “I was like, ‘I need water.’” Ronnie felt like she could no longer tell if she was playing Williams or if Williams was playing her.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Je3eCH"&gt;She doesn’t remember how she got back to the hotel. The next day, Williams told her he’d carried her to her room from the taxi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2mm7GbG7n3n2lP2wcrqA5zJJdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063575/VRG_4308_Oomba_ParkingGarage.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SbpZHM"&gt;As her job at Oomba grew more ambiguous, Ronnie tried to hold her boundaries while still appearing keen to please. She’d welcome office guests with a chipper hospitality, offering coffee or tea. One potential business partner laughed at Williams’ leering joke about her talent for “teabagging,” and later, at an airport bar on the way back to Vegas, he asked for her number. On the plane, she says, Williams asked if she would have sex with the businessman to secure the deal. “He was literally trying to see if he could send me to the hotel room to make the contract go through,” she says. The guy was married, and the whole thing was “gross.” Ronnie said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvVY5Z"&gt;When they got to Vegas, Williams invited her into the room he was sharing with another sugar baby. Later, she heard him telling someone that they’d had a threesome, and she became annoyed. “I’m like, bro, that was not a threesome. That was just me awkwardly masturbating while you’re getting your dick blown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX5bJV"&gt;Still, over time, she found herself doing more than she’d thought she would. When she first met one of Williams’ favorite strippers, he tried to get them to make out with each other in a back room; when Ronnie didn’t want to, “they kicked me out.” Six weeks later, when she met a different stripper, Williams got a hotel room and Ronnie let the other woman penetrate her with a sex toy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wr6wP5"&gt;At work, their relationship was an open secret, but rather than prompting shame, Ronnie’s proximity to Williams gave her influence. She reveled in her newfound power: “If somebody did something I didn’t like, I would tell him, and he would go off.” She says at least two people got fired because of her. Colleagues would ask advice on how to approach Williams or for help getting paid. If it was someone she liked, Ronnie was happy to help. “I’d be like, ‘So-and-so needs money. They’re really behind on rent. Can you just cut them a check?’ And he would.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mytgoY"&gt;Williams told Ronnie she should drop out of her part-time associate degree program because if she stayed at Oomba, she could rise through the ranks. He effectively promoted her to executive assistant and showed explicit shots of her on his phone to at least one senior-level employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ZHga"&gt;“I was just like, ‘Yeah, I’m the center of attention, and this is great, because I’m getting paid for it,’” she says. “I felt like a badass.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y9YURx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was very clear how lost she was”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNkWjz"&gt;In January 2017, she moved in with him. Not long after, a woman that Williams often described as a stripper was performing at a warehouse rave. Ronnie and Williams went and took LSD. At one point, she told him she’d be back in ten minutes, but she got lost in the music and disappeared for two hours. He was upset. On the way home, sitting in the backseat of his BMW while a friend of hers drove, Williams reached over to hold Ronnie’s hand. She felt repulsed, but she worried about rejecting him: “He’s on acid, and who knows what he’s going to do, so I smiled and pretended I was okay with it.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG3bEC"&gt;Soon, Williams decided to hire the stripper who had performed at the rave, a white woman with dyed red hair and a penchant for headdresses, to appear on OombaTV. He spent $700 on a backdrop and paid her $500 a week to come in for a few hours, leaving other employees baffled. “No nerds are going to watch a girl pretend to DJ in gamer costumes and jump around,” one employee texted another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klJbcB"&gt;Ronnie didn’t mind seeing the redheaded stripper every so often at work. But then Williams decided to hire another stripper full time, a woman with a punk-rock look named Jenna*. He gave Jenna a title and a position well above Ronnie’s: chief of staff. “I couldn’t handle her being there and whispering in my ear, and then him whispering in my ear,” Ronnie says. Other people at Oomba were also stressed by Jenna’s presence. (Jenna did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBl3dN"&gt;“It was very clear how lost she was,” Hogan remembers. “It just kind of felt like she didn’t do anything.” After one employee noticed Jenna was using the office shower, she texted two co-workers, including the HR manager, who responded, “Does she fucking live there after hours?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhxXHH"&gt;Jenna was more confrontational with Williams, Ronnie says, trying to convince him to go to therapy. The pair once got into a fight at the office and stormed outside, right when a meeting was supposed to start. For half an hour, everyone else in the meeting sat in a conference room overlooking the parking lot, waiting and watching Williams and Jenna yell at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BQyjfN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They were like, ‘Oh, okay, sorry, sorry, let’s go to the strip club.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2SUoKr"&gt;At home, Ronnie started to feel the strain of what she’d taken on. She let Williams go down on her, and then wished she hadn’t. She was doing his laundry and cleaning up after him, but when other sugar babies came by, she didn’t like that Williams treated her like the help. She was supposed to be special, his unicorn, better than the other women. Things were getting serious with another guy she was seeing, and Williams asked, to her disgust, if he could watch them having sex. Finally, one afternoon, Williams and the redheaded stripper tried to surprise her in the building’s garage. They approached dressed as cops: him in a hat and aviator sunglasses and her in a sexy two-piece police costume with high boots. Before Ronnie understood what was happening, Williams turned her around and the redheaded stripper started to handcuff her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPE4G8"&gt;“I felt one cuff close in, and you hear that &lt;em&gt;cshh&lt;/em&gt; noise, and I just started freaking out,” Ronnie says. She felt that this was a clear violation of boundaries: a sexual scene she had never agreed to, with restraints that put her at their mercy. “I was like almost crying, but I didn’t want to seem like the pussy in the situation.” When Williams and the redheaded stripper saw her panic, they gave up. But Ronnie was shaken. “Afterwards, I was like, ‘You really don’t give a shit about me.’ They were like, ‘Oh, okay, sorry, sorry, let’s go to the strip club.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkDUTG"&gt;By the end of February, she decided to move out and told the HR manager, who texted two other employees about it. “That’s a tough decision, because he pays her bills,” one responded. “He’s so disrespectful, he humiliated her,” the HR manager wrote back. “She’s young and got manipulated by him. Now she’s realizing it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsaGqo"&gt;Ronnie brought her mother and her boyfriend to tell Williams she was leaving and to convince him to take her off the lease. “He said her mom wouldn’t even speak to him,” the HR manager later texted an employee. “He said they canceled date night and he stop [sic] giving her money and she’s probably upset by that.” Williams was disappointed but maintained he didn’t want Ronnie to leave Oomba. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FU5NsL"&gt;Within a week, he changed his mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InwXmL"&gt;“Now that she’s over him he wants me to drop the hammer   on her. I can’t do that. That’s a fucking lawsuit waiting to happen,” the HR manager texted an employee. “I want her to leave on her own. This way it’s not on us.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fxflvf"&gt;At the end of March, Ronnie found another job. In April, Williams hired a new receptionist, a young woman in her early 20s who liked corgis, açai bowls, and One Direction. She had yet to graduate from college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnyEph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_7Gt-AUyJ3g2mp9HJm62sFLavCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063445/Oomba_Heels_Linebreak_Blackout.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="pdv4Aa"&gt;Other than gossiping about the CEO’s sugar babies, Oomba’s employees spent 2017 preparing for an epic undertaking called the Unrivaled tournament series: a $4 million attempt to bring the fanfare and showmanship of pro-wrestling to tabletop games, with over $250,000 in prizes. OombaTV planned to stream regional Unrivaled tournaments from about a dozen cities across the country for six games — including Munchkin, Ascension, and Epic Spell Wars II: Rumble at Castle Tentakill — all leading to a grand finale at Bally’s Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, owned by Caesars Entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngq7sZ"&gt;“He did that I’m sure thinking, ‘Hey, I’m going to drop all this cash, of course they’re going to give me their esports business,’ but they were two totally different divisions,” recalls Matt Scott, who was then Oomba’s CTO. And in spite of Williams’ many trips to Vegas, now with Jenna and the new receptionist in tow, Caesars was not impressed. At one point, when he flew in without an improved demo, a key executive wouldn’t make time to meet with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epXtIq"&gt;“He sat in the waiting room to see someone senior at Caesars, for hours on end, who would never see him. But he threw a tantrum, essentially, like, ‘I’m not leaving,’” says the former Caesars manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOZS88"&gt;The Connecticut investors were desperate for the Caesars deal to work out — or for any deal to work out, really. By now, Oomba was in settlement negotiations with a different group of over a dozen early investors who were accusing Williams of securities fraud, breach of contract, and solicitation, having allegedly asked two women in the group to bring in new investors by having sex with them. Many of Oomba’s remaining investors were looking for an exit strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh7OSZ"&gt;One opportunity seemed to be a complex arrangement called a special purpose acquisition corporation, or a SPAC, put together by the investment arm of a financial services company. The SPAC would allow Oomba to go public without the hassle of an IPO. But first, the company needed to survive an audit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0O7Aaw"&gt;“As far as I could tell, the books were all over the place,” one senior-level employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vvPgY7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Time out: ‘Pokémon’!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvidod"&gt;As the audit went awry, and Williams realized going public meant giving up equity and therefore control, he searched for an alternative. He found it in ExWorks Capital, a Chicago firm that specializes in financing businesses with high-interest loans. Somehow, Williams convinced the fund to give him over $20 million — including over $17 million to acquire the arcade chain, GameWorks. (The similarity between the names GameWorks and ExWorks was just a coincidence.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oi75k3"&gt;After a year of Williams blowing deadlines, GameWorks chairman Howard Brand was thrilled. “We got a six and a half X return on capital, so my partners and I made a lot of money on this,” he says. But as GameWorks began to merge with Oomba, in the summer of 2017, the chain’s leadership started to see how Williams ran his company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6yXRd"&gt;Once, during a presentation, Williams got an alert on his watch and announced, “Time out: &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;!” He walked out and grabbed the new receptionist, so the two of them could hunt monsters in the augmented reality game &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;. Another time, someone from GameWorks saw Williams and the new receptionist leave the office together, holding hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGQY5x"&gt;“Never having been closely connected to Silicon Valley companies or something like this, I recognize that culturally, there are some differences out there,” says former GameWorks CEO Greg Stevens, who has worked in the family entertainment business for 21 years. “It’s nothing I would have allowed in my organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0hhLD"&gt;By July, Oomba was receiving $850,000 a month from ExWorks, giving Williams more confidence. “He got too big for his boots,” one board member tells me. At a meeting with Red Bull, he asked them to fill his BMW with cans of the energy drink. He used money designated for payroll to buy two Mercedes Benz Sprinter vans, supposedly for the OombaTV team to drive to regional Unrivaled tournaments. He bungled an opportunity to work with the company behind his beloved &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering &lt;/em&gt;after asking for many times more in licensing fees than Scott, the CTO, thought was appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LWAAR"&gt;By the end of the summer, at long last, Oomba managed to demo its software for Caesars. Williams had actually followed through. He left the room before the meeting was over and emailed asking for significantly more money than what had been agreed upon. That evening, Williams and Scott were supposed to have dinner at a tavern with a senior figure at Caesars. “When he gets to the table, he just looks at Mike and starts railing on him,” Scott recalls. “I’d never seen someone turn purple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwrkRQ"&gt;“You finally deliver something we like, and then the deal terms are completely different?” the man yelled. He left the restaurant without sitting down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSBT8w"&gt;Eventually, Williams sent threatening emails to Caesars management, and the people who had been working on the deal were told to never speak with him again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0N806v_msTl1Bql0LzMTMFtqQGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063572/VRG_4308_Oomba_Batman.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7KI60y"&gt;As the Unrivaled tournament approached, its budget swelled. Fewer game stores than expected participated in regionals, and few people showed up to play. No one was buying tickets to the Vegas finale. Williams grew frustrated, and when he saw that Hundley, the actress, made a mistake on the event’s landing page, he called and berated her for several days in a row. To lock in an audience, he decided to cover airfare for over 800 players and staff and hotel rooms for over a thousand. One employee said Williams even commissioned a company to pay hundreds of additional people to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfNZlu"&gt;Then, a few weeks before the Vegas event, something unusual happened. Scott was told that Williams had invited a female employee to his hotel room while they were traveling for work; when she refused, he apparently told her he’d find a way to fire her. This wasn’t the weird part; Williams had been openly behaving this way around female employees for years. But this time, Scott told the HR manager at GameWorks — who actually investigated the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lX5u4N"&gt;Soon, internal investigations revealed that Williams had “sugar daddy” relationships with several employees, including Jenna and the new receptionist. He’d recruited assistants through the sugar daddy website SeekingArrangement, where he called himself SharpCEO and claimed he was worth $50 million. He’d put company money toward buying a car for his brother and motorcycles for himself and another employee. And Williams had transferred around $200,000 out of the company’s bank account to use as he pleased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgzwwJ"&gt;“Mike was handling the cash himself, even though there was a CFO,” says one executive from this era. “He was using it as his personal checkbook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FC7uHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One employee rushed to leave her grandfather’s funeral in San Francisco, so as to keep her job&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JFChoj"&gt;Even before the HR investigation was complete, a handful of C-suite executives and a board member&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;got together at a coffee shop to figure out what to do. It didn’t take long to decide Williams needed to be fired. “We felt we had no choice but to do so, under California law, and also simply being human,” one board member says. From New York, Hundley urged them on, apparently feeling betrayed after Williams’ outsized response to her website error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6fvlB"&gt;The plan was to confront Williams on a Wednesday evening, after everyone had gone home. A corporate attorney would review the charges on speakerphone. One board member was present in person, and the other would call in from the East Coast; the two men had already signed a letter to Bank of America removing Williams from the accounts, effective at 5PM. A locksmith would change the keys and the security code. A security guard was even waiting to escort Williams off the premises because a few people had heard Williams boast about having a gun in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srIjLr"&gt;The meeting started off okay. “Mike was confused. We caught him off guard,” Scott recalls. For much of the conversation, he was almost in denial. After a while, Williams begged the group to at least allow him to do the Unrivaled finale in Vegas, which was ten days away. But the board voted and removed him from his position. Then, he grew calm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieeWWm"&gt;“Well, this is all going to work out fine. I’m going to turn the tables,” Williams said. “You guys can’t fire me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pVdpu"&gt;He left, promising this wasn’t the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61mu5X"&gt;“And here,” explains Scott, “is where he really revealed his sideways genius.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbJfTm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OVipSSexIQZEZ-0ebn0gnwq1uSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22063444/Oomba_Money_Linebreak_Blackout.0.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KPGc1P"&gt;The next day, Oomba’s employees were disturbed to find an armed security guard at the office entrance. The executives ushered everyone into the conference room and announced that Williams had been voted out. Hundley was on speakerphone, saying, “You guys are safe now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9eBFF"&gt;“This whole Unrivaled nonsense is going to stop,” one executive told the room. “We’re going to cancel it, salvage our losses, and not rack up any more bills.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqezmU"&gt;Oomba’s employees stared back at him. Most had spent the past year working on Unrivaled. As they surmised, many were about to be fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxrHrt"&gt;One of those immediately laid off was Jenna, whom the executives didn’t think had been contributing anything. But as it turned out, Jenna had administrative access to the company’s servers. And ostensibly at Williams’ direction, she soon locked out Scott and the people who’d fired her and restored access to Williams, who began reading everyone’s emails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuYYqA"&gt;That Saturday, Williams and Jenna came back to the office, and once again, called a professional to change the locks. Williams emailed many employees to fire them, and then contacted a smaller group that he saw as loyal, asking them to meet up that weekend. One employee rushed to leave her grandfather’s funeral in San Francisco, so as to keep her job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfne6y"&gt;In the middle of all this, Scott called the police and came down to the office. Williams “poked his head out, waved around some paperwork, and showed the cop this founder’s document, which said he was legally entitled to appoint new board members,” Scott says. “And there wasn’t a lot we could do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSP8yB"&gt;As it turned out, Williams, not the people who had initiated the coup, was in charge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evQ15Q"&gt;“No one had really looked at the agreements,” one executive says. “Basically, he enjoyed a majority of common stock, so he couldn’t be fired.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObuGOZ"&gt;The executives scrambled and reached out to the partners at ExWorks Capital, trying to explain that Williams was a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gldHB"&gt;Williams, too, reached out to ExWorks, referring to the other group as “pretenders” and asking for another $1.6 million to finish paying for Unrivaled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUzO6M"&gt;ExWorks sided with Williams. The COO, the CFO, and Hundley were fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="h671aE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Looking back, I’m like, ‘What a toxic situation!’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H0U5L0"&gt;The next week, at the Unrivaled tournament, Williams ran around in a Batman costume with the new receptionist dressed as Batgirl. There was a marching band, there were zombie versions of the cranky old men from &lt;em&gt;The Muppet Show&lt;/em&gt;, there were Broadway-level production values, and there was &lt;em&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; actor Wil Wheaton, all for people sitting onstage at a folding table, rolling dice and throwing down cards. The theater was filled with people who were paid to be there. The software struggled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXbajH"&gt;Over the next few months, ExWorks sent in a forensic accountant, and the remaining people from GameWorks tried to convince them to stop giving Williams money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKI30F"&gt;“They just didn’t seem to take it to heart,” Stevens says. Instead, over the next six months, ExWorks provided Oomba with another $9 million, bringing the total to around $35 million. “The fact that they seemed to have an open spigot allowing him to do whatever he needed to do on the spending side of this? It was beyond shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWuJvZ"&gt;In late November, the core team of engineers quit, including Hogan, who by then had graduated college and who estimates that after four years, Williams owed him six figures in backpay. And in May 2018, Oomba officially came to an end, with ExWorks taking over what was left: namely, GameWorks. (“ExWorks foreclosed on the assets and new management was installed,” explains former ExWorks executive chairman Randy Abrahams in an email.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYoOCg"&gt;Hundley decided to sue Williams and Oomba, and she reached out to Ronnie, among others. Ronnie never got back to her: “I’m a sex worker, they’re going to use that against me,” she explains. Ronnie also felt confused about her role in what had happened, and she felt terrible about being complicit in any harm, especially with the people she got fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juTUXR"&gt;In a sworn declaration for Hundley’s case, one employee said they’d heard Williams say “something along the lines that ‘Dylan is only good at getting money by sleeping with investors.’” Hundley tells me she’s unable to comment because she signed an NDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5SK7U"&gt;During the pandemic, Williams posted on LinkedIn to draw attention to his latest venture, called Glytch. Once again, he appeared to be running the company alongside an attractive woman. This time, instead of Hundley, it was Jenna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EqBNhz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Williams is also a pawn in a larger system — and according to the rules of that system, finishing the game empty-handed is hardly a victory&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8yRCRZ"&gt;Ronnie doesn’t dye her hair anymore; she keeps it black. This spring, she finished her associate degrees and is starting a bachelor’s, hoping to become a translator. She feels estranged from the version of herself that worked at Oomba. “Looking back, I’m like, ‘What a toxic situation!’” she says. A lot of it was fun, but she sees now that it was an empty kind of fun, papering over lies, greed, and exploitation. “With money comes power: to be able to go places and be like, ‘Yeah! We’re the richest bitches here!’ But we weren’t, though. We just made it seem that way, and I helped him portray that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvruwT"&gt;In the past few years, as she watched woman after woman come forward with stories of workplace harassment and abuse, she started to realize she needed to tell the world about what happened at Oomba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItLiEI"&gt;“I know I’m not the first or the last girl, so I have to speak on it. Otherwise, I’m saying ‘Screw you’ to the other survivors,” she says. She’s sorry it took her so long to talk about what happened, but she explains, “I was 23 at the time, and I wasn’t very mature. I’m 26 now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvphuP"&gt;Perhaps most of all, Ronnie regrets that Williams’ tactics inspired her, however briefly, to manipulate anyone. Life shouldn’t be a game, she thinks, with people divided into winners and losers. “Everyone thinks capitalism is so great, but then you get educated and you’re like, ‘No! You’re literally leaving people starving,’” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3IOfI"&gt;Over the course of Oomba’s existence, a lot of people ended up as losers, and though no one is starving, at least one golf club member predicts he’ll need to work longer to build back his retirement savings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxszHS"&gt;As for the winners here, well, Williams seems unscathed. But as Ronnie points out, Williams is also a pawn in a larger system — and according to the rules of that system, finishing the game empty-handed is hardly a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcfQCI"&gt;The real winner in the Oomba saga might be the only person who walked away with money to spare: the chairman of GameWorks, Howard Brand. Stevens tells me the $17 million that Williams got ExWorks to pay for GameWorks was more than the company was worth. And after Stevens and Brand spent years painstakingly bringing GameWorks into profitability, Williams fumbled the ball, with ExWorks losing almost $29 million on the chain since 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEC0jV"&gt;When I asked Howard Brand about what happened at GameWorks after Oomba took over, he went over everything Williams had done wrong, point by point. Reviewing the mistakes and misrepresentations of a man who wore a costume to their first meeting, Brand sounded dumbfounded. But in the end, he says, it wasn’t his company anymore. Williams, and whatever destruction he may have caused, wasn’t his problem. “I know a lot of people hate him,” Brand says, but for him, it’s nothing personal. It’s business. Everyone’s out for themselves. This is how the entire economy works. And if you’re playing to win, you can’t get caught up in minor details like what happens to the people who lose.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BvyhDW"&gt;“I was just primarily interested in the cash,” Brand says, in a dispassionate yet satisfied tone. “I got paid. I’m done.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVavIe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oh91yY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Names were changed to protect the identity of those involved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze will soon support CarPlay’s split-view dashboard mode </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaOh4tV63SAzV49sMyc9ixD94fI=/45x0:765x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845961/waze_carplay_split_view_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MxuQD5"&gt;Waze is finally coming to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"&gt;Apple CarPlay’s new multiscreen dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. This is sure to come as welcome news to devotees of the Google-owned navigation app, who have been waiting for over a year for it to work with the much-improved, upgraded version of CarPlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoA1EQ"&gt;A tipster who is beta testing the new feature sent us this image of Waze operating in CarPlay’s new Split View function. Apple rolled out the new dashboard as part of last year’s iOS 13 software update, but it was limited to only work with Apple Maps at the time. Previously, CarPlay required bouncing between different screens to see a track name while getting directions to a destination. With Split View, you can see a map, what’s currently playing on the car’s stereo, and the next piece of guidance to your destination all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkicLT"&gt;Apple eventually released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194115/carplay-dashboard-third-party-map-support-ios-apple"&gt;iOS 13.4 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced the option for third-party companies to add support for the dashboard mode on their own mapping apps. It took Google until August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358978/google-maps-carplay-dashboard-mode-update-support-directions"&gt;implement support for Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;. And now it seems like Waze (which is also owned by Google) is soon to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sI35hT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 13’s best upgrade is in your car","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18693555/apple-ios-13-carplay-interface-update-hands-on-test-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BmWO7M"&gt;A spokesperson for Waze wouldn’t confirm the beta testing, so we’re not sure when the navigation company plans to officially announce the rollout. “We actually don’t have anything to share right now. Will be sure to keep you posted if/when we do,” the spokesperson said in an email. Waze has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. The company was founded in Israel in 2008 and was later acquired by Google in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNMc2j"&gt;The beta also features the first support for lane guidance in Waze for iOS, the tipster said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437960/waze-lane-guidance-traffic-notifications-google-maps-features-amazon-music"&gt;This handy feature&lt;/a&gt; recommends what lane you should be in when you’re entering or exiting a freeway, for instance. It’s also helpful when navigating complicated intersections or highway mergers. The tipster described the ability to use Waze in CarPlay’s new split-screen dashboard as “really smooth” and a “game-changer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqPuXF"&gt;Like many companies, Waze has been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emptied roadways around the world and sent many cities into lockdown. As sheltering in place and working from home become the new norm, fewer people are using Waze for their daily navigation needs. Fewer eyeballs on the app means less advertising revenue for the company, which led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;Waze laying off 5 percent of its global workforce&lt;/a&gt;, or around 30 people, in September. More recently, the company’s CEO Noam Bardin announced that he would be &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepping down in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6Z1yX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikon is bringing back its free online photography classes for the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGVfKp_rWWP4lCQ8gA7YgZUskOU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845644/cwelch190917_3726_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyCj4K"&gt;Nikon is bringing back its promotion that allows you to stream its entire online curriculum of photography classes at no cost, just in time for the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kefeq1"&gt;Now through December 31st, you can stream &lt;a href="https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/"&gt;all classes featured at the Nikon School Online&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, these classes cost between $15 and $50 each. Each course is taught by a professional photographer and features in-depth lessons to improve your photo-taking skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDv9h5"&gt;However, it is important to note that although it is called the “Nikon School Online,” you do not need to own a Nikon camera to take advantage of these free courses. A few classes focus on Nikon-specific gear, but most of the classes available focus on photography as a skill set and how to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Krqut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nikon previously offered this promotion in April&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RubFDz"&gt;I streamed the classes earlier this year when they were free, and I really enjoyed the course that focuses on photographing children and pets because I picked up a few helpful tips on how to take better photos of my twin brother’s Pomeranian puppy with my Nikon D3100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAbhS6"&gt;Nikon previously offered this promotion in April before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21204243/nikon-free-photography-classes-april"&gt;extending the offer until May 31st&lt;/a&gt;. With the holiday season quickly approaching, if you plan to buy a camera for yourself or a loved one, it’s not a bad idea to watch these online courses to ensure you get the most out of your gift. Or if you were planning to take some photography classes to improve your skills, save some money; you may want to give these videos a look first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj2hec"&gt;You can stream &lt;a href="https://www.nikonevents.com/us/live/nikon-school-online/"&gt;all the online classes right now on Nikon’s website&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to sign up and provide your name and an email address before you can watch. But don’t worry; you can opt-out of receiving marketing emails after signing up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat officially launches in-app TikTok competitor called Spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9StGrKZjSSt5hDjEETydj7YeJbM=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845641/snapchatspotlight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LhvBV"&gt;Snap is finally ready to compete with TikTok and will pay creators to post on the platform. The company is officially announcing a new section of Snapchat today called Spotlight that’ll surface vertical video content from users that’s more meme-like and jokey instead of the day-in-the-life content Snap previously encouraged. Imagine, basically, TikTok but in Snapchat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EFiyj"&gt;To entice people to post snaps regularly, the company says it’ll divvy up $1 million between the most popular creators on the app per day through the end of 2020. This means if someone has a particularly viral video, they might earn a large chunk of the $1 million pot. It doesn’t matter whether that person has a massive number of subscribers; the amount people receive is primarily based on unique views compared to other snaps that day. Users can continue to earn from their video if it’s popular for multiple days at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfETfI"&gt;Spotlight, which will have its own dedicated tab in the app, is launching in 11 countries, including the US, UK, France, Germany, and Australia. The videos you’ll see in the section can be up to 60 seconds long and, as of right now, cannot be watermarked. That means people can’t just download their (or others’) viral TikToks and upload them to Snapchat. Once you tap into Spotlight, you’ll see snaps programmed to what Snapchat’s algorithm thinks you might enjoy. It bases this decision mostly on what you’ve viewed in the past and how long you’ve watched. Anyone can submit a snap, they’ll just have to tap “Spotlight” when posting to ensure it populates the section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azySAt"&gt;Although the format will be familiar to anyone who’s ever watched TikTok, Snap says it’s made specific decisions based on its user base. For one, Spotlight snaps won’t feature a public comments section, and profiles themselves are private by default, so Snapchatters can keep their accounts locked down while still posting content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAhMr5"&gt;The Spotlight section has been hinted at for months, given that Snapchat announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352680/snapchat-music-embed-tiktok-competitor"&gt;music in snaps&lt;/a&gt; back in August. The app lacked a feed for these snaps up until now, however. The company already allows users to submit their snaps as part of a location that anyone can drop into and watch to get a feel of what’s happening in a given place at any moment. They appear in &lt;a href="https://map.snapchat.com/"&gt;Snap Map&lt;/a&gt;. But unlike that feature, which is more documentary in nature, Spotlight is specifically designed for viral video formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAEQAK"&gt;With Spotlight, Snap is clearly acknowledging the success of TikTok’s short-form viral videos, similar to Instagram’s admission with its launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels&lt;/a&gt; in August. In Instagram’s case, however, it plainly allows people to bring their TikTok content over to the platform. Snap is instead trying to encourage people to use its own creation tools and prevent monetization fraud by keeping people in its app. Stories used to be the format everyone wanted to copy, thanks to its success on Snapchat. Now, it’s the TikTok video. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We’ve got all of the best deals for this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="T7zvHb"&gt;It may be difficult to celebrate the holidays in person with family and friends this year, but if you’re planning to send some special gifts to your loved ones, there are two annual events that you can still look forward to: Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year, of course, it will take place primarily online, but that doesn’t mean you won’t find a wide range of deals from big-box stores like Target, Best Buy, and Walmart and online retailers like Amazon, Newegg, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GarvM0"&gt;We’re going to monitor all of your favorite retailers this holiday weekend for deals and last-minute price drops on a wide range of tech products, including phones, gaming gear, streaming services, laptops, headphones, and a lot more. We’ll also let you know when a retailer has sold out of a product so you won’t waste any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgQcb"&gt;Expect to find excellent prices on in-demand tech products, ranging from big 4K TVs and capable laptops to gaming consoles, smartphones, headphones, games, and much more. You’ll be able to find each development below as well as tips on the best products to buy and how to save money when shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A different Super Mario Bros. game now holds the title for most expensive ever sold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YyR6FYMKdWK8iIbQ1_cpaYbmKAY=/126x83:1074x715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67845550/super_mario_bros_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game featured a rare box layout and was in excellent condition.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/nintendo/super-mario-bros-3-wata-92-a-sealed-bros-left-first-production-nes-nintendo-1990-usa/a/7236-93032.s" target="_blank"&gt;Heritage Auctions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mVB3am"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt; now holds the title of the most expensive game ever, after a sealed copy from 1990 &lt;a href="https://www.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/rare-sealed-super-mario-bros.-3-variant-breaks-record-for-world-s-most-expensive-video-game.s?releaseId=4032"&gt;sold for $156,000&lt;/a&gt; at an auction last Friday. Bidding started at $62,500, and 20 bidders were involved in the auction. The NES game handily beat out the previous record-holder, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;sold for $114,000 in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhjv9m"&gt;According to Heritage Auctions, which sold the game, the game’s record-breaking price came down to a couple of factors. The first was its relatively rare box design, which has the word “Bros.” formatted to the left on its front, where it slightly obscures Mario’s hand. Later versions moved the word to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3#/media/File:Super_Mario_Bros._3_coverart.png"&gt;center-right&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vJj578"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game had a rare box design and was in excellent condition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AQAqo4"&gt;However, this rarer design only explains part of the price, since one of these variants sold at the auction house in July for just $38,400. What accounts for the rest of the value appears to be the condition in which it was sold. The game was given a Wata 9.2 A+ rating for its condition, which rates both the &lt;a href="https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/wata-scale"&gt;quality of the box and the quality of its original seal&lt;/a&gt;. The previous version, meanwhile, had a slightly lower rating of Wata 9.0 A.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRilbh"&gt;Alongside &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt;, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Red&lt;/em&gt; became the most expensive &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game sold when it was purchased for $84,000 during Friday’s auction. Heritage Auctions doesn’t mention whether there was anything unique about this particular version, but it appears to have been sold in a remarkably good condition, with a rating of Wata 9.8 A++.&lt;/p&gt;
