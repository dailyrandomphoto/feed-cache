    <title>Procedural storytelling is exploding the possibilities of video game narratives</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer’s Legacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Authorship takes on an all-new meaning in games where the plot is yet to be written&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="3FCgY2"&gt;Procedural stories in video games often induce a specific kind of delight. You’ll know when it hits — a realization that the code and algorithms of the game seem to be generating a coherent narrative from your own impulsive, seemingly chaotic actions. It’s what 2020’s viral sensation &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/8/6/21357131/blaseball-fans-absurd-baseball-sim-the-game-band?fbclid=IwAR3n5wfZoPUEICMrcvsvvlYW_AwLa3r3aJLTIgB-5Ld5ApBS3W54KA_Mi_Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and this year’s breakout indie hit, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22638600/wildermyth-review-pc-proc-gen-worldwalker-games-strategy-mac-linux"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; share in common — two strikingly different games whose reactive stories are nevertheless cut from the very same cloth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91khFz"&gt;Players have grown accustomed to procedural generation in a spatial sense. Just look at the endless variations of levels that define games such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ever-popular rogue-like genre and the infinite planets that populate the virtual universe of 2016’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5856718/no-mans-sky-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But procedural narratives are a different beast. (Distinct, it should be noted, from pre-written branching stories). They’re slippery, simulation-driven configurations of plot, setting, conflict, resolution, and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ClkZu"&gt;Drama, as video games continue to prove, is harder to convince players of than space itself, which makes procedural successes all the more eye-catching — from mainstream hits such as &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; to cult classics like &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rimworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now it feels like this sandbox approach to storytelling is starting to bear even greater narrative fruit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCTIoI-44YC3iRTcryAET8Gruc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049847/Volcano_Fort.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSuuq"&gt;If you ask game makers about the origins of procedural narratives, you’ll get nothing resembling a consensus. For some, it started with randomly generated dungeons of 1980’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443430/Rogue/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; for others, choose-your-own-adventure books. Nate Austin, designer and programmer of tactical role-playing game &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;, sees procedural storytelling as stemming from tabletop board games like &lt;em&gt;Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; — experiences that provide rules and a structure from which a vast number of narratives can spawn. In his view, and those of more than a few others, 2006’s &lt;a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a management game about dwarves seeking to colonize an austere, text-based world, is the inheritor to this particular &lt;em&gt;genus&lt;/em&gt; of narrative design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plwseD"&gt;For newcomers, &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; can be intimidating. Beneath its mass of inscrutable &lt;a href="https://www.asciitable.com/"&gt;ASCII&lt;/a&gt; icons lies a fiendishly complex simulation. On a basic level, its world is filled with flora, fauna, foes, and resources, plus, of course, your dwarves, all of whom have unique personalities. Your job is to ensure their happiness by building a colony that can satisfy their various needs and, thus, ensure the survival of the group. You might ace colonization itself, but then, suddenly, a gigantic monster kills half your group, which means you fail to bring in the harvest. Just like that, the colony is no more. “It sort of naturally creates these stories,” says Austin over Zoom. “And because you’re invested in the personalities all along, the drama happens in your head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GbrfaZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With procedural storytelling, there’s the suggestion of a machine beneath the hood.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqJKyJ"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; and 2016’s &lt;em&gt;RimWorld&lt;/em&gt; (which self-consciously builds on the former’s legacy), Austin suggests this is the closest video games have come to the freedom of tabletop experiences — “theater of the mind,” as he calls it. The designer has fond memories of such experiences, having played and dungeon-mastered &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; sessions as a kid&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;alongside his siblings Douglas Austin and Katie Austin (both are writers on the game). This narrative possibility is precisely what Austin sought to capture with &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;, albeit in a more accessible style than either of those two games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTwJX7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; begins, as you might expect, with randomly generated characters. At first, they’re humble homesteaders but eventually grow into battle-hardened protectors of the realm. Events happen along the way: love, rivalries, children, and death. The most remarkable aspect of the game is that neither the precise order of these events nor their exact form is preordained. &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; cooks up its story on the fly, and so while narratives follow a broad structure, they never quite land the same. Crucially, these characters are yours, so you care for them in a way that would perhaps surprise even the most curmudgeonly player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLhbeK"&gt;The game’s magic, explains Austin, is in its “alternating layers of handcrafted and procedural content.” There’s the grand central narrative with a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end — procedural events that stem from the combat and personalities of your characters; then there’s the comic strips (dubbed “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/A5BGDbLFRrE?t=559"&gt;Library of Plays&lt;/a&gt;”) that bookend each event. Crucially, these “plays,” of which there are well over 100, are written in such a way that the code is able to seamlessly incorporate your heroes into them. The game succeeds both on a momentary basis — by turns charming, funny, suspenseful — and as a larger work of fiction, ebbing and flowing like a classic fantasy epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqwe2W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth’s&lt;/em&gt; magic also stems from its approach to time. Campaigns typically last a century of in-game time, which means you not only see your characters age but the enemy advance ominously across the world map. Procedural RPG &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/unexplored-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (currently in early access) works similarly. Every time your character dies, time and the game’s foes march forwards, and in this moment, you see the game’s whirring systems most clearly. “With procedural storytelling,” says Joris Dormans, director of&lt;em&gt; Unexplored 2&lt;/em&gt;, “there’s the suggestion of a machine beneath the hood. You’re interacting directly with that, and in a way, you’re collaborating [with it] to create the story. I think that’s so powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErCvgH1YQgZIMW03FLGN9kksoiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049855/screenshot1920_combat1_ThrixlCave.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eosvty"&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2&lt;/em&gt; are products of what’s become a cottage industry of procedural storytellers across Europe and North America. Montreal’s Kitfox Games is both a developer of games like the wonderfully gloomy cult simulator, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/21/18188670/the-shrouded-isle-switch-pc-mac-os"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Shrouded Isle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a publisher. It’s set to release a visually updated version of&lt;em&gt; Dwarf Fortress &lt;/em&gt;on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, part of an ongoing collaboration between co-founder Tanya Short and &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt; designer Tarn Adams. (The two co-edited 2019’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.routledge.com%2FProcedural-Storytelling-in-Game-Design%2FShort-Adams%2Fp%2Fbook%2F9781138595309&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F30%2F22807568%2Fprocedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procedural Storytelling in Game Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — what amounts to a bible for aspiring writers and designers in the field.) Across the Atlantic, Emily Short (no relation to Kitfox’s Tanya) recently joined Failbetter Games as creative director, bringing a wealth of interactive fiction experience to the studio developing the romance-murder game &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769980/Mask_of_the_Rose/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mask of the Rose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEIEbp"&gt;Short’s CV includes both interactive fiction classics (2000’s &lt;a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/emrhyy7pp0c8bjkjeuhs-g/galatea"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galatea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asks you to have a conversation with a sculpture), as well as tools like &lt;a href="https://versu.com/"&gt;Versu&lt;/a&gt; (axed in 2014 by its proprietor, Linden Labs, the studio behind &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;). Like Dormans, whose work in video games stems from his PhD on emergent game design at the University of Amsterdam, Short has one foot in commercial game development and another in academia. She’s not alone — there’s a big crossover between the two worlds because studios are reluctant to fund costly research and development when there’s no guarantee of successful outcomes. Game makers often spend a few years cutting their teeth in the industry, moving into academia for research, before returning to commercial game development armed with a fresh set of narrative tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybGY6OSyB6RVA0P37UNlLOfw3uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049872/Blaseball_Short_Circuits___The_Discipline_Era.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ysV9Lq"&gt;The major hub of this academic study is University of California, Santa Cruz, home to students and professors that cluster around its &lt;a href="https://eis.ucsc.edu/"&gt;Expressive Intelligence Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 2006 by Michael Mateas, maker of the ambitious 2005 conversation simulator &lt;a href="https://www.playablstudios.com/facade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Façade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the work that emanates from the lab continually pushes the boundaries of AI and storytelling. Academics such as Max Kreminski are focusing their efforts on what they call emergent narrative, another name for the same kind of simulation-driven plots of &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/em&gt;. Over an audio call, they describe it as a “bottom-up” approach to narrative design — their job is to “find and bubble up” the interesting stories that fall out of the player’s interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrUYNF"&gt;One way Kreminski is attempting this is through what they call “&lt;a href="https://mkremins.github.io/publications/Felt_SimpleStorySifter.pdf"&gt;story sifting&lt;/a&gt;,” an approach that could give even greater shape, structure, and meaning to these procedural narratives. Think of it as the computer scanning (or sifting) in-game events to find interesting micro-stories — perhaps a lovers’ tryst or an escalating tale of revenge. These are surfaced to the player and then woven back into the game. The greatest challenge, explains Kreminski, is not in identifying these stories (he feeds the computer examples of what to look for) but matching events that have already happened with those that are in the process of emerging. If he can do this, these stories can be stitched together in such a way that they become a cohesive whole, a kind of plot-combo that stretches both in front of, and behind, the player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOv5uy"&gt;Kreminski points to a few titles that have utilized something close to story sifting in the past. 2004’s &lt;em&gt;The Sims 2&lt;/em&gt; features “&lt;a href="https://www.kmjn.org/notes/sims2_ai.html"&gt;story trees&lt;/a&gt;,” which recognize sequences of events and nudge the player towards completing them. Social simulation &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/impressions-prom-week"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prom Week&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(which emerged from the Expressive Intelligence Studio in 2012) features characters that look at the history of its high-school world to influence next actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1qGVY"&gt;But perhaps the most in-depth implementation of story sifting is in 2020’s ongoing absurdist baseball simulator, &lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt;. Players bet on matches involving bizarre fictional teams (like the Baltimore Crabs) whose roster includes even weirder procedurally-generated characters (their traits can range from Shakespearian to anti-capitalist). The sifting happens in a few different ways, explains Cat Manning, narrative and design consultant on the game. At first, it was simply oral storytelling — players would have to see an event happen in real-time and then relay that to the community. But then, because the game spits out an eye-watering amount of data, players were having trouble keeping track — which is where the&lt;a href="https://sibr.dev/"&gt; Society for Internet Blaseball Research&lt;/a&gt; stepped in. The fan community essentially developed a tool to let players watch replays of past games using data available on the site, what Manning calls a “backward story sifting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGr3c2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt; now features its own “feed” on the site that surfaces important storylines to players, but a great deal of the story sifting still happens organically in the Discord chat. While most procedural stories occur within single-player games, &lt;em&gt;Blaseball&lt;/em&gt; is a rare example of what happens when the scope is blown up to incorporate tens of thousands of players — almost like a mass hallucination. The deluge of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/8/6/21357131/blaseball-fans-absurd-baseball-sim-the-game-band"&gt;fan art&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; is a testament to not just the stories its spreadsheet-like simulation generates but the way we as players are able to imagine color and detail into its world, just as readers do with literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hImrlRYWRVVpcMk_aqlA7trOkJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049874/ss_68697a274ce491c11d94c0cc94a213177945919c.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4OmbCH"&gt;You might be wondering why major studios, usually so quick to incorporate such innovations into their glossy blockbusters, haven’t yet jumped on procedural storytelling. The simple answer is that the variables involved become infinitely more complex and expensive at such scale. Still, there are a few exceptions: 2014’s action-adventure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/1/6881161/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-torture-terrorism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks your showdowns with the game’s Uruk mini-bosses through its &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/shadow-mordor-nemesis-system-amazing-how-works/"&gt;Nemesis System&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, the game creates rivalry-focused mini-narratives inarguably more enjoyable than the main story itself. There’s also the &lt;em&gt;State of Decay&lt;/em&gt; series,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which features a cast of algorithmically generated zombie survivalists, the first a great deal more successfully than the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtwPUQ"&gt;By far, the most ambitious blockbuster attempt at procedural storytelling is 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319047/watch-dogs-legion-ubisoft-hands-on-preview-hacking-open-world-london-gameplay"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Its hook, the “Play As Anyone” system, lets you recruit non-playable characters to a crack squad of hacker-activists seeking to liberate a grim, dystopian London. Every single non-playable character has a unique background — occupation, hobbies, relationships, felonies, special abilities — all of which are generated by the game’s “Census” system. The beauty of the game lies in assembling this squad according to your own specific preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="69e4Hh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s already so many spinning plates.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BgliBr"&gt;While the “Play As Anyone” system is easy to understand, its implementation was anything but, says Liz England, team lead game designer, over Zoom. She describes it as like picking up a rock only to discover there’s an entire civilization attached below. Because of its procedurality, whole aspects of production had to be relearned — animation, lip-synching, in-game lighting. “There’s already so many spinning plates shipping a game like &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Legion&lt;/em&gt;,” says England, “and then you say to everyone, ‘This tech you’ve been using, we’re gonna throw it out. This pipeline, we need to invent it from scratch.’ To make a game with a difficult concept to wrap your head around from a developer’s side and then to scale that to hundreds of people across multiple studios around the world — it’s very different to if you’re making an indie game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1fF1P"&gt;England, who recently &lt;a href="https://me.ign.com/en/pc/190473/news/state-of-decay-studio-founder-jeff-strain-starts-new-studio-possibility-space"&gt;joined&lt;/a&gt; a new studio headed up by &lt;em&gt;State of Decay’s&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Strain, says there are other aspects of indie procedural storytelling that big-budget games can’t hope to match — at least not yet. Take medieval power simulator &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/1/21417091/crusader-kings-3-review-pc-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crusader Kings 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which generates text boxes with information specific to your playthrough. That becomes much harder when it’s something somebody actually has to say out loud. “The whole audio pipeline is just very expensive,” continues England. “It needs to be done early on because it has to be recorded with actors in other languages.” On a broader level, procedurality, especially within narratives, involves a relinquishing of control over the player’s experience. Making sure it’s one that can meet the expectations of famously exacting video game players — well, that’s tough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9K1e1LZZ2YGpNuurDa_6VpfWORQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049882/14_Unexplored_2_Early_Access.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17Kn3y"&gt;As it stands, the indie world will continue to innovate, both in terms of games themselves and the tools used to create them. Emily Short, creative director of Failbetter Games, is excited about “socially and culturally democratizing” the space. “Having knowledge and tools be accessible, and having new people come in who want to experiment — this is part of the reason I write so much on my &lt;a href="https://emshort.blog/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “Even if specific innovations that I’m working on go nowhere, at least I’m equipping other people. It feels to me like there’s a huge space of unknown possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLyKIP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It feels to me like there’s a huge space of unknown possibilities.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FMi6xU"&gt;Others echo Short’s sentiment. Because of the high level of technical expertise required to make these stories work, studios tend to have their own in-house software solutions. At the moment, says Tanya Short of Kitfox Games, it’s a case of “everyone building their own weird engine.” But she knows of one developer who’s about to start looking for private funding to develop their own tool (inspired, she says, by Versu). “There’s a need for it,” continues Short, “because there’s an emerging vocabulary set, but it’s basically industry jargon. Without words to describe [procedural storytelling], it’s very hard to discuss.” Alongside such tools, the Kitfox co-founder predicts machine-learning will buff up the audio and visual aspects of procedural storytelling, from voice-acting to art, so you’ll have “much higher production values on all indie games but especially those with procedurally-generated content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp96ks"&gt;What’s clear is that procedural storytelling won’t wholesale replace straightforwardly human-authored plots anytime soon. For those worried about such a possibility, Short offers a thoughtful rebuttal. “That feels like it’s mistaking the pleasures of one thing for the pleasures of a different thing,” she says. Instead, players will continue to enjoy the sharply focused, linear narratives of titles such as those in the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;franchise while being able to play games that convey the unmistakable, thrilling sensation of co-authoring a story with a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sxwfMX"&gt;While the likes of &lt;em&gt;Wildermyth&lt;/em&gt; are part of a long procedural storytelling tradition, the field as a whole still feels as if it’s only on act one — the potential is as vast and varied as stories themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwbEzE"&gt;Hello! I’m back from Thanksgiving break and now have mashed potatoes for brains. Really, I’ve eaten mashed potatoes five days in a row. I can stop, but I won’t stop until the leftovers are gone. Anyway, in between mashed potato servings, I did my best to “log off” and not think about audio — no offense — so instead, I binged the entire new season of &lt;em&gt;Selling Sunset&lt;/em&gt; and played many crosswords. I’m back for you now, though, and we have a big issue ahead. We’re talking about how a dating app stumbled upon viral audio success, and I chatted with the CEO of podcasting’s latest $100 million-funded company, Podimo. Plus, an update to my RadioPublic story from last week and new Apple charts. Lots! Of! Stuff(ing)! On we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUzQSi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Hinge makes viral audio happen, despite many other apps trying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l46H4Q"&gt;Today’s main story is one best told in a couple parts. The first: Last month, the dating app Hinge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746297/hinge-voice-notes-prompts-profile"&gt;debuted&lt;/a&gt; voice prompts to daters’ profiles. Instead of telling potential matches about yourself with text, you could do so with your voice. Each clip can be 30 seconds, and, at launch, Hinge said two out of three daters it polled thought voice would help them “better determine their chemistry” with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xwRzd"&gt;Fast forward to now, and, well, voice prompts are certainly doing something. The prompts have gone viral on TikTok and Twitter, with people reposting them either because they’re funny, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DNA_Bethylation/status/1462668039049158656?s=20"&gt;cringe-worthy&lt;/a&gt;, or something in between. There’s impersonations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaycesimpson1/status/1465166046323625992?s=20"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DJKZA/status/1462239099205472262?s=20"&gt;sincerity&lt;/a&gt;, and bizarre moments. NBC News wrote about the viral fad a couple weeks ago, which you &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/hinges-new-voice-prompts-are-tiktok-hit-rcna5663"&gt;can read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmoMGl"&gt;I reached out to Hinge to get more concrete data on how this feature is performing and whether going viral was part of the plan. The company tells me 13 percent of new daters on the app build their profile with a voice prompt and that 46 percent of people on the app have listened to at least one voice prompt. A slow build, but one Michelle Parsons, Hinge’s CPO, interprets as encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9eWAu"&gt;“If you imagine the amount of extra time that it takes to add any piece of information to your profile, it’s already a friction point. So we’re really excited with this, and our plans are to continue to help users see the value, and things like them going viral on TikTok has definitely been very helpful for us here,” she says. She also adds that these new users — the 13 percent integrating the feature — are seeking voice prompts out on their own because their creation isn’t part of the onboarding flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DBrpFF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;46 percent of users have played a voice prompt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rMwHi3"&gt;People on the app record their voice in response to their selected but Hinge-curated prompts, so they aren’t just talking about nothing for 30 seconds. The most popular prompt so far, per a spokesperson, is: “A life goal of mine.” The second most popular is “All I ask is that you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiYZPu"&gt;Throughout our chat, Parsons emphasized the reason Hinge thought voice prompts made sense in a dating app. Namely, if people are “trying to assess vibe, personality, what [a match] is looking for, [and] what’s it like to date them,” Hinge is best off giving them as much data as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hN1FQ"&gt;“Our goals are to get users off of the app and into a relationship, or at the very least into a good date, and the constructed, the curated, doesn’t always necessarily relate to a positive experience with another person, and so we want to help users showcase more of their personality, more authenticity, which really comes from your voice — it’s really hard to hack your voice,” she says, adding that the team didn’t see “very high adoption” of voice calling, another audio-oriented feature, likely because making a cold call to a stranger is more intimidating than firing off a 30-second clip and hoping for the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6f5Z5N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People took to voice prompts, not voice calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOSNgZ"&gt;Now, part two of this story is how Hinge got lucky with this viral moment. Lots of other apps are trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22570683/audio-short-form-podcast-app-racket-beams"&gt;create the TikTok of audio&lt;/a&gt; — Facebook chief among them, along with many decently funded startups focusing on shortform audio. Hinge didn’t set out to make a viral feature that would come with wide-ranging network effects, or at least Parsons says that wasn’t the intent. So why did this take off? For a couple reasons, I think. For one: Hinge already has a massive network. It’s been downloaded &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Earnings-Letter-Q2-2020.pdf"&gt;more than 5 million times&lt;/a&gt; and has a better shot of making a feature popular over a startup. (Facebook has yet to widely launch its attempt at shortform audio, Soundbites, and I’ll be watching how that performs for similar reasons.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOeCwB"&gt;Two: The dating app space is particularly ripe for viral audio — context is everything. A random person telling you their opinion on what NYC pizza spot is the best or, god forbid, their life goal is incredibly boring. There are no stakes — why do I care? But if you’re instead assessing whether you want to literally meet this person or hook up with them, all of a sudden, that opinion is critical. (L&amp;amp;B’s, baby!) This is also probably why Clubhouse had such a pandemic moment. Currently, I can go talk to my friends and family IRL or over the phone or even go to a bar to chat up a stranger — why do I want to have someone talking at me through an app? But when we were all stuck at home, the stakes were real. When will I meet a new person again??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsuQij"&gt;All of which is to say, these startups have a challenge ahead of them. TikTok made remixing sound and visuals viral fodder, and the same will happen solely for audio, too, I’m sure. But will it be inside a wholly new app or one you join for some other purpose and audio is the fun bit on top? My bet is on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EX2OXQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQz2bE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: The newest $100 million podcasting app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJJn2J"&gt;There’s a new, highly funded podcast app on the market: Podimo. The app, which has yet to come out in the US but launched in 2019 and is already in multiple European and Latin American countries, announced its $78 million Series B funding round late last week, bringing its total funding to over $100 million. That’s a number familiar to those of us who’ve been watching this space for a minute now — Luminary famously launched with $100 million in funding, as did Himalaya. (Though a source told me Himalaya’s funding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526502/himalaya-histudios-notorious-llc-podcast-audio-hype-house"&gt;was made up&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVpxX1"&gt;Funnily enough, Podimo’s strategy is somewhat similar to both those companies’ in that its business is built around subscription audio. Users pay a set amount per month to stream as many exclusive podcasts, audiobooks, and “experiences” as they want, and Podimo pays the creators of that audio based on their content’s popularity. (SoundCloud is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309090/soundcloud-artist-stream-pay-listener-fan-royalties"&gt;deploying a similar model&lt;/a&gt; for music.) So, if you listen to podcasts on Podimo and 20 percent of your time is spent listening to one specific show, 20 percent of your subscription payment will go to that audio creator, minus the cut Podimo takes for its services. (RSS-based podcasts can also distribute on Podimo, but they get less of a cut of that listener revenue.) The idea is that creators will be incentivized to promote Podimo because they make money off the listeners there, and they’ll also be encouraged to go exclusive to make even more, along with other perks, like extra promotion. Podimo says it has over 950 exclusive shows and audiobooks on the platform currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uw0WT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Podimo raised $78 million in its Series B round&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ioYqPj"&gt;I spoke with Podimo’s CEO and founder, Morten Strunge, before the holiday to get a better sense of how Podimo plans to use this recent cash infusion and how its past couple years have gone. The question I most wanted to know, of course, was when Podimo might launch stateside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DffDMC"&gt;“It’s not the top of our list,” he says. “It’s not that we don’t see an opportunity for a service like Podimo in the US, but obviously competition is bigger there, and it requires deeper pockets to make a difference. So it’s definitely on our roadmap, but it’s not the first country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD0dPb"&gt;The funding he says will broadly go toward “content” and “creators,” like “bringing even more content onto the platform that in return will fuel user growth.” The team will also invest in marketing, the actual tech product, and expanding to new markets. Notably, Podimo partners with hosts and fronts the creation costs for exclusive shows, so this funding will help the team do more of that. Strunge also adds that 90 percent of listening happens in a user’s native language, so Spanish, Danish, Norwegian, and German, and the team is hyper-focused on approaching each of its markets locally. It already partners with &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/press-release/podimo-wondery"&gt;Wondery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.iheartmedia.com/press/iheartmedia-and-podimo-partner-translate-and-adapt-widely-popular-podcasts-listeners-globally"&gt;iHeartMedia&lt;/a&gt;, and Sony Music Entertainment’s &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/press-release/somethinelse-podimo-translation"&gt;Somethin’ Else&lt;/a&gt; to translate their English-language shows for Podimo’s users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frMDDM"&gt;In Denmark, Strunge says the company has 100,000 paying subscribers out of a market of 6 million people. “What’s been important for us is to show that this is not a niche thing, but it’s actually a mass market thing, something that millions of people would subscribe to in a market like Germany and not thousands of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbvG7c"&gt;It’s all very similar to the big subscription dreams of Luminary and Himalaya. Both were focused on the US, and neither panned out as expected. But maybe going abroad changes that outcome, especially with so many shows under its exclusive offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cMzmYQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="Ao2q6I"&gt;Phew, we’re past the two big pieces and can get you onto more news. I don’t want to spend too much time here, so I’m just going to drop a few things to think about, and we’ll get either more into later this week for you paying subscribers or onto new things. Who can say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJL3VN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: RadioPublic says it’s fixed its app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MTrvj"&gt;Last week, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22797808/podcast-app-acquire-radiopublic-acast-rss-feed-hot-pod"&gt;reported on issues&lt;/a&gt; podcasters were having with the RadioPublic app — their RSS feeds weren’t updating; they couldn’t get in touch with anyone from the company; and new shows couldn’t be added to the catalog. The company tells me it has now fixed the issue. Matt MacDonald, CPO at Acast and RadioPublic co-founder, says the issue had to do with an &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-10-04"&gt;expired SSL certificate&lt;/a&gt; from Let’s Encrypt. Here’s what MacDonald had to say about the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SyH9Ea"&gt;“We have systems in place to readily catch bugs, problems our podcasters encounter, and issues affecting feeds. This issue in particular was of a nature that evaded those systems. It’s one we regrettably missed and should have caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TFOaM"&gt; Since resolving the issue, we’ve updated RadioPublic’s systems to avoid future problems of this nature. Our team continues to monitor that all our services are running smoothly, and when our Pro users encounter issues and contact us, we continue to provide individualized support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S8c5GN"&gt;Let me know if you keep running into issues, but this should hopefully be solved for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LcNO6f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R2THE8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple divulges the most popular subscription shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ52zm"&gt;Apple Podcasts is getting into the end-of-year content early with new charts and curated content. The company &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-podcasts-presents-the-best-of-2021/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its curated selection of the best shows and episodes of the year just around an hour ago — &lt;em&gt;A Slight Change of Plan&lt;/em&gt; from Pushkin is its top pick — as well as new charts around free and paid shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyAcIZ"&gt;I’m including screenshots of the full list below, but I want to specifically call attention to the top paid shows. Three Uncanny Four’s &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood: The Final Chapter&lt;/em&gt; is the top paid show, which, as we last know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697263/john-carreyrou-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-decoder"&gt;from September&lt;/a&gt;, had 6,000 paying subscribers. We can probably presume that’s gone up a bit since the Theranos trial has picked up, but that’s essentially the ceiling. (What happens to this feed when the trial ends?) Otherwise, Betches has two shows in the top 10 individual subscription shows, and people are apparently paying for Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon’s program, too, which hm, who knows what’s going to happen after all this recent Cuomo controversy. Apple spokesperson Zach Kahn had nothing to share around when or if these charts might get updated again. I might have more on this on Thursday once I have time to parse, but if you have thoughts, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AoJngb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify and Netflix are friends who launch audio hubs together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uwZJW"&gt;I have seen &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of hype over Spotify and Netflix’s news &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-23/get-even-more-squid-game-bridgerton-and-money-heist-with-our-new-netflix-collaboration-and-dedicated-hub/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that they’re partnering to launch an audio hub on the Spotify app. This means Netflix’s publicly available podcasts (read: available everywhere) are now in one place on the Spotify app, along with music from popular programs. Currently, one soundtrack, &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Fall&lt;/em&gt;, is called an “enhanced album” with the Spotify logo on the cover, which means it includes a video intro from writer, director, and soundtrack EP Jeymes Samuel. Despite the hype, I’m unconvinced this is a monumental moment. If Netflix were ever to go the exclusive podcast route, I think they’d likely include them in its own app — why would it cede any of viewers’ attention to Spotify? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQoobP"&gt;Could this mean more collabs in the future between the two companies? Sure. Does this just logically make sense as a partnership? Yes. People want to listen to Netflix soundtracks, and Spotify is making it easier for them to do so along with some bonus content. Friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPuDu9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse monthly users reportedly fall off a cliff but are still millions-strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIB12z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-clubhouse-poster-child-pandemic-hype-2021-11"&gt;a big look at Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; this past week that hits the major points of conversation around the app: the dearth of advertisers, a drop-off in downloads, and controversial “drama rooms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qavq5S"&gt;The main data takeaway is a graph depicting that in July, Clubhouse reportedly peaked with 13.45 million monthly active users but just a couple weeks ago had fallen to only 6.78 million. Its daily active users dropped from 4.09 million at its peak in February to around 942,000 two weeks ago. All that data is according to a company called Apptopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GogiwH"&gt;A spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; the app is a place where “millions gather daily” and that overall growth exceeded expectations. “We expect to see a regular fluctuation as we grow,” this spokesperson added, along with the fact that 700,000 rooms are created daily, and the average time spent on the app is 70 minutes. Millions of people logging on monthly doesn’t read so badly to me, but the drop is steep and something Clubhouse is going to need to turn around before its competitors seize the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Zi4jzn"&gt;
&lt;p id="EqksR4"&gt;All right! That’s it for today. I’ll catch you paying folks Thursday, and for those of you who have yet to subscribe, I don’t have a Black Friday special for you, except that &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;for $7 / month&lt;/a&gt;, you can impress all your friends and family with far too much audio industry knowledge. A deal IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA delays spacewalk due to threat of space debris</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6cR5UmdSvHPZM19jQr0-L7G_LnE=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209125/51712323194_e68ff4a0da_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Space Station&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPr6n7"&gt;Early this morning, NASA postponed a spacewalk scheduled to occur outside the International Space Station today, after getting word of a possible safety threat from some nearby space debris. It’s unclear where the debris is coming from, but the delay comes about two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia blew up one of its own satellites in orbit&lt;/a&gt;, creating thousands of dangerous fragments that threatened the space station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMEpbu"&gt;NASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Thomas Marshburn were all set to don spacesuits and leave the confines of the ISS this morning at around 7:10AM ET, in order to replace an antenna on the outside of the station. It would have been the fifth spacewalk for Marshburn and the first for Barron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wmdlVg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA says that it didn’t have enough time to “properly assess the risk”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIV6yH"&gt;But before they could depart through the airlock, NASA personnel in mission control stopped the spacewalk. “It’s just real life, this is how things work out sometimes, and I’m really glad you fellows are looking out for our safety,” Mark Vande Hei, one of the astronauts on board the ISS, told flight controllers in mission control, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-spacewalk-called-off-possible-risk-space-debris-notification/"&gt;according to CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHthsN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/f32d86b1-dc7c-4815-9893-9b4d69bdef27"&gt;In a short blog post&lt;/a&gt;, NASA says that it didn’t have enough time to “properly assess the risk” the debris posed to the astronauts, and so the agency opted to postpone the spacewalk until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsW-86tJeqlZwCEJUQwolgNWiOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052321/marshburn_barron_promo2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn and Kayla Barron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JxBUnv"&gt;It’s the second time in the last two weeks that space debris has upended plans on the International Space Station. On November 15th, the astronauts onboard the ISS were awakened extra early by mission controllers and told to shelter in place after Russia conducted an anti-satellite, or ASAT, test. Using some kind of kinetic missile, Russia blew up one of its own satellites, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791176/russia-asat-satellite-test-space-debris-visualizations"&gt;creating at least 1,700 pieces of trackable debris&lt;/a&gt; and thousands of smaller pieces that cannot be tracked. As the satellite was orbiting relatively close to the ISS, the debris cloud periodically passed near the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5EBTS"&gt;NASA did not say if the debris that postponed the spacewalk is from the same ASAT test, and the space agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, NASA insinuated the delay will not have a big impact on the station. “The space station schedule and operations are able to easily accommodate the delay of the spacewalk,” NASA wrote in its blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqd9Sx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyNDe3"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj5fFb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9q3Di"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nIdln"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rodOqm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agg4w7"&gt;If you missed out on a few great deals during Cyber Monday or Black Friday, don’t worry, you still have another chance to save big on some popular tech products. It’s “Cyber Week,” meaning that many retailers are still delivering some of the best deals of the year for you to grab all week long. Below, we’ve curated some of the top discounts you can still take advantage of on wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, phones, laptops, TVs, video games, and more. Take a look, and if you like what you see,  you may want to buy the product sooner than later. These particular deals could disappear at a moment’s notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdVSU"&gt;If they do sell out, fret not. It’s very likely that December will bring some repeat deals, plus new sales because of the holidays. If you want to keep receiving the latest deal-related updates then even after this week is over so you can continue to save, subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. We compile the savings that you need to know about, then send them to you twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally $179.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $170 &lt;s&gt;$150&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; right now at checkout. While we still recommend the AirPods Pro (especially at just $10 more currently), the third-gen AirPods sport shorter stems, IPX4 water resistance, and improved sound over the last-gen model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A8AcL4"&gt;Amazon’s second-generation Echo Buds that include a wireless charging case &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds-2nd-Gen-Wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-Alexa/dp/B085WTWYS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are just $90&lt;/a&gt; (down from $140). This is the best deal that we’ve seen yet. If you don’t need a wireless charging case, the set that includes a case you’ll need to plug in to charge &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds-2nd-Gen-Wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-and-Alexa/dp/B085WTYQ4X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $70&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="Hm1y6z"&gt;Regularly $200, the Galaxy Buds Pro are currently on sale for around $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="2SWtbQ"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, are available for $79 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted their drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, their higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The NBA is partnering with Infinite Objects to put your Top Shot NFTs on display IRL</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjUEaMWYw4LAeHTIBtJf5JjhV_k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70208763/NBATopshot_IOxTS_Durant_James_still.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NCmk7a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot moments&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most high-profile NFT successes so far, part of the initial early hype wave for the blockchain-based art that’s become one of the biggest buzzwords of 2021. And thanks to a new partnership with Infinite Objects, Top Shot owners will soon be able to immortalize their favorite clips in the real world with officially licensed looping video frames from Infinite Objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="aF12sU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA tries to make a slam dunk out of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u7xp35"&gt;Starting today, Top Shot owners will be able to log into Infinite Object’s portal, connect their Dapper account, view all their currently owned moments, and order a “Video Print” of the clip. Only the owner of an NBA Top Shot moment will be able to buy an Infinite Object frame with the associated video clip on it, and each frame will come with a QR code and holographic sticker to attest to its authenticity. Right now, all Top Shot moments are eligible to be printed except for those featuring retired players or those with WNBA clips (Infinite Objects says its still working out the licensing there.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_0lAh4OFBF20usf93YCdslhkpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050744/1_xi2VP4sDHqmXTlJ3lUUJKA.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="icrznq"&gt;The Infinite Object NBA Top Shot frames will cost $199 for the 5.7 x 8.4 inch “Large” size  and $399 for the bigger 11.4 x 7.5 inch “Extra Large” size. Each frame can only display a single moment, which can’t be changed out or swapped after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtZXJ9"&gt;The official frames — at least in theory — answer a major question about Top Shot moments (and NFTs in general): what to actually do with the digital artwork once you’ve bought it. And Infinite Objects is also working to enable “printing” other NFTs from artists outside of the NBA in the future, too. That said, there’s nothing about the Infinite Objects prints that would prevent you from ordering a video print and then selling the NFT while still having the art on display in your living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qDKnWq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZ5CSejZe3v7ouDitLAO9XpUCRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050740/Shopify_Topshot_Preview_V3.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IL6El"&gt;Infinite Objects is a natural fit in a lot of ways for bringing NFTs into the real world — the company’s “Video Print” frames launched back in 2019 as a way to bring collectible digital GIFs and videos off the internet, long before the current NFT hype had begun. The original idea of the company even sounds a lot like NFTs (albeit without the blockchain component), where Infinite Objects sold limited-run looping video frames for prices as high as $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPtzYT"&gt;Since then, the company has also expanded to partner with Giphy on selling animated emojis and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21097049/giphy-infinite-objects-valentines-day-gifs"&gt;Valentine’s Day cards&lt;/a&gt;, along with previous (not-NFT-related) &lt;a href="https://infiniteobjects.com/collections/nba"&gt;NBA partnerships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMiLQl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Sxmnx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRobot Roomba update uses AI to avoid knocking over your Christmas tree</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgmYWVwA7wkwXZynTNbbmpzHQcs=/0x176:2048x1541/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70208617/Roomba_j7__Lifestyle_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roomba j7 Plus, released this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: iRobot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="brfCLF"&gt;iRobot has released a holiday-themed update for its latest robot vacuum cleaners to help them handle the cleaning demands of Christmas trees. The j7 and j7 Plus robovacs can also now identify and avoid shoes and socks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpmX2V"&gt;The festive trees, shoes, and socks feature builds upon iRobot’s latest navigation and control software, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price"&gt;first released in August last year&lt;/a&gt;. This software uses machine vision to identify furniture and specify “clean zones.” For example, you might have a dining table you want a Roomba to specifically clean under after chaotic family meals. There are also “keep out zones” which a Roomba might suggest avoiding, like the area under a TV stand filled with cables for it to get caught on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="flGgrg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mapping data can now be transferred from robot to robot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JaPLi"&gt;So when it comes to Christmas trees, the j7 and j7 Plus will be able to suggest a “clean zone” around the tree, where you can specifically direct it to vacuum up pine needles, with a “keep out zone” in the middle to stop it bumping into the tree and risk knocking it over. I’ve personally never had a problem with a Roomba knocking over a Christmas tree, but it’s helpful being able to specifically direct it to vacuum around a tree, rather than having it constantly vacuuming the whole room along with it. According to &lt;a href="https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/65"&gt;iRobot’s release notes&lt;/a&gt;, the “holiday tree recommendations” update started rolling out yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bETmDQ"&gt;iRobot initially announced socks and shoes avoidance alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price"&gt;j7 Plus’s dog poop detecting feature in September&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time said it would be added with a firmware update later this year. It’s a potentially handy feature given how much of a problem shoelaces can be for robovacs. As well as shoes, socks, and pet mess, the j7 and j7 Plus can also detect and avoid cords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSGUxH"&gt;Alongside the new detection and avoidance features, iRobot says that its robots with smart mapping features can now transfer their maps from one robot to another. It should be helpful for anyone upgrading their Roomba or augmenting it with a second model, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/29/18643881/irobot-roomba-s9-plus-braava-jet-m6-release-date-news-features-specs-robot-vacuum-cleaner-mop-dust"&gt;mopping-focused Braava jet m6&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than having to map your home afresh, the company’s robots that support its smart mapping technology can now automatically transfer their maps to a new robot. According to iRobot’s &lt;a href="https://homesupport.irobot.com/s/article/65"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;, this feature started rolling out on October 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It2gQn"&gt;iRobot is running a number of discounts on its robots over the holiday season.

    <title>Rocket League’s mobile spinoff is now available worldwide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOSllyutfYuou4i0YGiHSCVd-K4=/0x0:1998x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70208606/msedge_IPE3MxMO6w.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px9y0k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile version of the popular car-based soccer game, is now available on iOS and Android. The game started &lt;a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-sideswipe-preseason-begins-today/"&gt;rolling out on November 15th&lt;/a&gt; in Oceania, but is now available worldwide, albeit in a “pre-season” mode ahead of Season 1’s kickoff at an unannounced later date, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/29/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-launch/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQxQ2n"&gt;The free to play game, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22345184/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-announced"&gt;first announced in March&lt;/a&gt;, is a simplified version of the original &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; released in 2015. The biggest change is that the mobile version is played in 2D, rather than offering a fully three-dimensional stadium to drive around. You control your car with a virtual joystick on the left side of the screen, while buttons on the right handle jumping and boost. with touch controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O1fs8k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Rocket League Sideswipe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Available Worldwide on iOS and Android. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LL5qUjdoCl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LL5qUjdoCl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rocket League Sideswipe (@RLSideswipe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RLSideswipe/status/1465446286841331715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="teQGbr"&gt;Unlike in regular &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, the car’s boost auto-regenerates, so there’s no need to seek out recharging pads, and teams are limited to a maximum of two players per side. Available game styles include the game’s standard soccer mode as well as a basketball-style “Hoops” version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNQed9"&gt;If that sounds tempting, you can download &lt;em&gt;Sideswipe&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rocket-league-sideswipe/id1549027048"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Psyonix.RL2D&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BBC iPlayer finally arrives on PS5 with 4K support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ktBfY"&gt;The BBC is finally bringing its iPlayer app to the PS5 in the UK today, more than a year after the console’s original release. Brits have been waiting patiently for BBC iPlayer on the PS5, especially as the app is already available on more than 15,000 devices, including Xbox Series X / S consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="es50Nk"&gt;The BBC iPlayer app is now available in the media tab on the PS5 home screen, and it includes support for streaming 4K content from the service. “From today, PS5 owners can add the BBC iPlayer app by going to the Media tab on the PS5 home screen and selecting BBC iPlayer from the All Apps section,” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/articles/2021/bbc-iplayer-ps5"&gt;explains Neil Hall&lt;/a&gt;, head of product at BBC iPlayer. “This will add BBC iPlayer to the apps library and make it available to use direct from the PlayStation home screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGihWh"&gt;The iPlayer app for PS5 arrives just in time for the influx of Christmas TV shows, movies, and season finale of Doctor Who: Flux.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqzei8"&gt;The UK’s competition regulator has officially ruled that Facebook parent company Meta’s acquisition of Giphy should be unwound, a year and a half after the social media giant first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;said it was acquiring the popular GIF-making and sharing website&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that it had come to the decision after its investigation found an acquisition could harm competition between social media platforms, and that its concerns “can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reO12V"&gt;The CMA said the acquisition could be used to deny or limit other platforms’ access to Giphy GIFs and drive more traffic to Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. It also raised concerns that it could be used to require other platforms to provide more data to access the GIFs. Finally, the CMA also believes that Giphy’s advertising services could have competed with Meta’s, but that these were shuttered as a result of the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KgFRr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfNIeA"&gt;“The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market,” the chair of the independent inquiry group Stuart McIntosh said in a statement, referring to Meta. “Without action, it will also allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors’ access to Giphy GIFs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OumhaB"&gt;“By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,” McInosh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU8im6"&gt;This would be the first time the CMA has attempted to unwind a completed acquisition by a tech giant, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/662c8e3f-4909-4bec-9131-c0237bb4897d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. Although Meta may appeal the decision, the UK regulator’s decision sets a notable precedent for future big tech purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8S81H"&gt;While groundbreaking, the CMA’s decision doesn’t come as a complete surprise after it’s preliminary findings report from August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator"&gt;said the deal should be unwound&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gP7n3z"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve directed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Facebook?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to sell Giphy after finding the takeover could reduce competition between social media platforms and increase Facebook’s already significant market power. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yRaPxMR43z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yRaPxMR43z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Competition &amp;amp; Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1465624517393489920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9muxf6"&gt;Responding to the decision, Meta’s EU director of policy communications Robin Koch, said that the company is considering all its options, including appeal. “Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources,” Koch said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUDU4C"&gt;Meta has also previously disputed the CMA’s competition concerns, and has suggested that there was never a chance of Giphy’s advertising business becoming a viable competitor. In response to the regulator’s investigation, the company argued that Giphy had “no meaningful audience of its own,” and when it announced the acquisition, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-giphy/"&gt;Meta said&lt;/a&gt; that it provided 50 percent of all of Giphy’s traffic. It also said “developers and API partners will continue to have the same access to Giphy’s APIs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz3IGg"&gt;Responding to the CMA’s provisional findings, Meta argued that the regulator was “sending a chilling message to start-up entrepreneurs: do not build new companies because you will not be able to sell them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5iAO1"&gt;Although Meta pledged to work with the CMA on its investigation, the regulator recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736236/facebook-giphy-uk-cma-fine"&gt;fined the company £50 million ($70 million)&lt;/a&gt; for failing to comply with the terms of its initial enforcement order. The regulator said Meta was “consciously refusing to report all the required information” about its compliance with the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eH0f"&gt;Giphy had raised $150 million in funding since its founding, but it had yet to turn a profit prior to its acquisition and was reportedly running out of money. Its sale price to Meta was $315 million, less than a previous valuation given to it by investors, and a sign of its financial trouble. While the CMA’s investigation has been ongoing, Giphy’s 100 plus employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621957/facebook-giphy-deal-blocked-uk-regulator#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Giphy%E2%80%99s%20more,with%20the%20arrangement."&gt;haven’t been able to become full Meta employees&lt;/a&gt;, although Meta has reportedly been paying the company’s bills to keep it running. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPX6mR"&gt;The CMA’s investigation is part of a wider wave of scrutiny being paid to tech acquisitions in recent years, and sits in stark contrast to when Meta was able to buy upstarts like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus with relatively little challenge. Multiple regulators, &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4021"&gt;including the EU&lt;/a&gt;, have opened investigations into &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-nears-purchase-of-startup-in-deal-that-values-it-at-1-billion-11606750196"&gt;Meta’s acquisition of Kustomer&lt;/a&gt;, a customer services platform for businesses. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634379/nvidia-arm-aquisition-delay-uk-phase-2-investigation"&gt;CMA has also raised objections&lt;/a&gt; to Nvidia’s purchase of chip designed Arm, another acquisition that’s attracted a lot of antitrust scrutiny from regulators around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CFCfy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 30th, 9:06AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Meta’s statement, and sale price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FIFA is trialling limb-tracking tech to catch offside players</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7niqXd"&gt;FIFA, the global governing body of the sport variously known as football and soccer, is trialling new technology that tracks players’ limbs to detect whether they’re in an offside position. The system will be employed at the 2021 Arab Cup, which kicks off today in Qatar, the host of next year’s World Cup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu0g07"&gt;FIFA calls the system “&lt;a href="https://www.fifa.com/news/semi-automated-offside-technology-explained-ahead-of-fifa-arab-cup"&gt;semi-automatic offside technology.&lt;/a&gt;” It involves a camera setup installed on the roof of the stadium, with limb data extracted from the video and sent to the match officials’ operating room so the offside line can be calculated in real time. The BBC &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/59461288"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that 10 to 12 cameras collect up to 29 data points for each player 50 times a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="05MtoA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Semi-automated offside technology explained ahead of FIFA Arab Cup. Pierluigi Collina and Johannes Holzmüller explain the advancement of the tests to date. This technology will be tested at the FIFA Arab Cup 2021™ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFArabCup?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FIFArabCup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FootballTechnology?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FootballTechnology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/A6Bef8f25A"&gt;https://t.co/A6Bef8f25A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/A63xwvYZTC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A63xwvYZTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FIFA Media (@fifamedia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fifamedia/status/1465263593868382209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6KT8WX"&gt;In soccer, a player is offside if the ball is passed to them with fewer than two opposing players (usually including the goalkeeper) between them and the goal line. It’s a critical rule that often leads to disallowed goals, but it can be difficult for referees to make the right decision in real time, and the limitations of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) technology have only added to the controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS9OUo"&gt;Currently, VAR involves analyzing a video feed and drawing lines on the pitch to confirm whether players are offside, but the footage doesn’t always have the resolution or the frame rate to determine the exact moment the ball leaves a player’s foot, for example. It can be frustrating to watch a match and wait multiple minutes after a seemingly legitimate goal to  find out whether it’ll be canceled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65OsW7"&gt;“VAR has had a very positive impact in football and the number of major mistakes is reduced, but there are areas where it can be improved - and offside is one of them,” FIFA”s chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina tells the BBC. “We are aware the process to check offsides can take longer [than other decisions], especially when it is very tight. We are also aware that the positioning of the lines may not be 100-percent accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHJRjR"&gt;If the tests at the Arab Cup are successful, the system may be used at next year’s World Cup, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
