    <title>Belkin’s new $150 3-in-1 charger is the first to get Apple Watch Series 7 fast charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qCus9mdPGv8YvNCxvFWvOMd7sQ=/125x0:1976x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160686/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.40.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TxkRI0"&gt;Belkin has a pair of new wireless Apple Watch chargers it’s announcing today, which are notably the first third-party chargers to support the newly added fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw8S32"&gt;The larger of the two is the $149.95 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz016%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, which follows in the footsteps of last year’s 3-in-1 Belkin charger. In addition to adding Series 7 fast charging, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21516404/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories"&gt;Belkin has ditched the odd sculptural design&lt;/a&gt; on the previous model in favor of a more normal-looking flat rectangular pad that will probably fit better on a nightstand. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKUMBJ0Oe14bbCcQ41uUJaZtDvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024679/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kl7fHl"&gt;The new charger aims to hit the perfect trio of Apple charging: full-speed 15W MagSafe charging for an iPhone, Series 7 fast charging for an Apple Watch, and a regular Qi charger for the AirPods. Of course, as has always been the case with Belkin’s combination chargers, the $150 price tag is far more than what it would cost to buy individual MagSafe, fast-charging Series 7 Apple Watch, and Qi chargers, meaning that you’re paying a decent premium for style and convenience here. That price also does include a 40W power adapter, so you’re at least getting a one-stop solution for your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK3Mgx"&gt;The other new charger here is a bit more baffling: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2Fp-wiz015%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22785707%2Fbelkin-apple-watch-series-7-fast-charging-magsafe-charger-boost-charge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pop-up Apple Watch charging stand that costs $59.95. Despite the “portable” in the name, Belkin’s solo charger isn’t a battery pack-style setup for recharging an Apple Watch while you’re out and about. And even more baffling, that $60 price tag doesn’t include a power adapter: while there’s an integrated USB-C cable built into the stand, you’ll have to provide your own 20W wall adapter to actually use it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHQgQgrZSpBYCYdarKvgYBK6G-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024682/Screen_Shot_2021_11_18_at_11.43.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U6DJhU"&gt;The net result is a larger, bulkier version of the fast-charging cable that Apple includes with every Apple Watch Series 7 — except that Belkin’s version costs literally twice the standalone cable’s $29 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63ZAiZ"&gt;Looking more broadly, though, is the fact that the new Belkin fast chargers show — once again — the intentional limits of Apple’s MFi program. The new chargers from Belkin are the only third-party fast chargers on the market right now, and if the pattern of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;last year’s glacial MagSafe rollout&lt;/a&gt; is anything to go by, it’ll be some time before other companies are able to get the approval (and the parts) from Apple to make other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LSmFy3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Vp3Hlv"&gt;Both the $59.95 BoostCharge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch and 149.95 BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with MagSafe are available to order today from Belkin and Apple’s respective websites in the US, Japan, Hong Kong, and China, with availability in more countries promised in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BTS fan Twitter accounts say they’re being targeted by copyright trolls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BTS’s Digital Single ‘Butter’ Release Press Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38RjMaSFCY659sjiEI2DMhAsCRA=/60x0:6144x4056/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160572/1319740646.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by The Chosunilbo JNS/Imazins via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvXJ9J"&gt;In the past several days, a number of headers, profile pictures, and tweets have disappeared across the wide network of BTS fan Twitter accounts. The culprit, the account owners say, is a recent barrage of fake DMCA takedown notices. Outcry from fans resulted in #TwitterMaliciousDMCA trending worldwide on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkQIWA"&gt;The owner of a fan account with over 233,000 followers, which posts videos, photos, and memes related to the South Korean band, claims that their original header and profile picture, as well as multiple tweets including their own screenshots and memes, have been taken down by the trolls over the past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l70oPn"&gt;Per the owner’s screenshots, the attackers appear to have reposted the account’s header on a spoof website in a backdated post, then claimed to Twitter that the image was their own. The spoof websites appear to have been taken down as of this writing, but the account’s header remains suspended “in response to a report from the copyright holder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IN0Le6"&gt;“Not gonna lie, this has been making me rather anxious,” the account owner tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qeFqB1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hello, with copyright harassment going on for the past 24hrs (4 strikes), I've decided to go private for the next few days – soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Updates will still go on, probably slower! If you'd like faster updates, feel free to join the Telegram channel (&lt;a href="https://t.co/SEPXep0fys"&gt;https://t.co/SEPXep0fys&lt;/a&gt;) – (1/3) &lt;a href="https://t.co/qjNnz0os9x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qjNnz0os9x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— BTS UPDATES⁷ | @BTSdailyinfo (@BTSdailyinfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSdailyinfo/status/1455600959061516297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kRrRhc"&gt;The group claiming to be behind these attacks calls themselves Team Copyright, and purports to be based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The group’s Facebook page is full of screenshots indicating that its members are responsible for the various copyright takedowns. It’s also full of threatening and discriminatory posts — the group claims it will “destroy the toxic fanbase” and criticizes BTS for “promotion of atheism and homosexuality.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8a056"&gt;A number of prominent BTS fan accounts, many of which have millions of followers, appear to have been hit by these notices. The profile pictures and headers of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bts_worIdwide"&gt;@bts_worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charts_k"&gt;@charts_k&lt;/a&gt; (which tracks the band’s positions on various charts), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btsvotingorg"&gt;@btsvotingorg&lt;/a&gt; (which nudges followers to vote for the artists for music awards), &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_Trans"&gt;@bts_trans&lt;/a&gt; (which shares English translations of the group’s social media posts), and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/taehyungpics"&gt;@taehyungpics&lt;/a&gt; (which posts periodic pictures of BTS member V) are all in copyright limbo as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEGL4d"&gt;Fans have scrambled to create second accounts, but those still don’t appear to be safe — tweets from a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSUPDATESGER2"&gt;backup&lt;/a&gt; for Germany’s fan base are currently suspended due to a copyright claim, while the group’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_UPDATES_GER"&gt;primary account&lt;/a&gt; has replaced its header and footer with blank colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esS97g"&gt;The attackers have even hit the band members a few times. Per screenshots widely shared among BTS fans, takedown notices resulted in the temporary removal of selfies from members &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jtoni_n/status/1448546895563870212"&gt;RM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joonlyricst/status/1431627242975678469"&gt;Suga&lt;/a&gt; that were posted from the band’s verified account over the summer, as well as the brief suspension of an official handle. (Both photos and the account have since been reinstated; Hybe, the label that manages BTS, has not responded to an inquiry about the reason behind their removals.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hyC6wB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They even took down actual photos posted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTS_twt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BTS_twt&lt;/a&gt; and had suspended an official account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BTSW_official?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BTSW_official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7fmD8KJ1YQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7fmD8KJ1YQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bora    (@modooborahae) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1461101912695189509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="10LTqy"&gt;Fans across Twitter have sprung to action, aggressively reporting the page to Facebook, tagging Twitter support in comments, and flooding Bangladesh’s minister of state for foreign affairs with tweets. Despite those efforts, Team Copyright’s page remains active as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdGGNW"&gt;Twitter and Facebook have not responded to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOwPFA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt4PYb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSVDsk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YS8E1g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s better Battle Pass progression is now live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A50wvRCkP5eE5HZCF0drb4EN1yk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70158973/HaloInfinite_RXJtJxSVSl.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="urkns2"&gt;If you’re still stuck on level 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass, fear not, as 343 Industries’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072"&gt;promised changes to progression&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598"&gt;now live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qTANV"&gt;The existing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass makes it difficult to level up, as you’re limited to completing daily or weekly challenges instead of earning XP for every game you play. While that isn’t changing yet, 343 Industries has added “Play 1 game” challenges, which will “help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want,” according to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; community manager John Junyszek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3HF7SN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To address the feedback on Battle Pass progression we will be making targeted tunings to our model later this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, we'll be adding "Play 1 Game" challenges to help make sure you consistently progress through the Battle Pass by playing matches the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1461124062021763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yId2pq"&gt;343 Industries will also be removing some weekly challenges and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369371427688452"&gt;fixing bugs&lt;/a&gt; with others, but these changes do have a small price. “When we make this update, we’ll need to reset your challenges, including your progress towards weekly ones,” explains Junyszek. “To make up for this reset, we’ll be granting this week’s Ultimate Reward, the Sigil Mark VII Visor, to everyone who logs in from November 23rd to November 30th.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jdgdvh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt; players can now earn XP by completing matchmade games. The "Play 1 Game" Daily Challenge is worth 50 XP each. The Challenge deck is also being updated to better serve players of all skill levels. (1/4)&lt;/p&gt;— Halo Support (@HaloSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1461369370303598598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WhuQBV"&gt;XP boosts will also now double in duration, lasting for an hour instead of 30 minutes, which will help for longer Big Team Battles games. We may even see further changes to the XP and progression systems in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;in the future, too. “We’ll be watching these changes closely to make sure they have the positive impact we all want on your progression,” says Junyszek. “This is only our first step - we are committed to continue evolving these systems but it will take time.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTGrLucpuf2Yks1-20j7TjTM3HI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925717/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XP boost changes should help during Big Team Battles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbrpz"&gt;Criticism around the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass progression has been getting increasingly louder across the community of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans this week after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise early release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. While multiplayer previews over the summer felt like an exciting return to form, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22725770/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview"&gt;we had concerns around the Battle Pass progression&lt;/a&gt; and XP systems. 343 Industries still went ahead with the same systems, despite concerns from many during the technical previews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3uFn2"&gt;It’s encouraging to see quick changes, though. This opening &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; season will last until May, which is double the three months that had originally been promised. That extra time could be why 343 Industries kept the slow Battle Pass progression in the first place, but we’ll have to check out the changes in practice to see if they make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aH9Sxd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 18th, 12:03PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The promised changes are now live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge is getting price tracking and leaked passwords features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdgXSjPEhRnjUyTxfSU4Oq7P1sU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160314/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lojPrL"&gt;Microsoft is planning to add a new price tracker to its Edge browser, as well as a new feature that will let people easily change their passwords if they’ve been leaked online. The price tracking feature will be available soon and is designed to track products you’ve recently viewed and alert you of price changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wiw9Xt"&gt;Microsoft has focused a lot on shopping improvements with its Edge browser and already has price comparison, price history, and built-in coupons in Edge. “This feature is coming soon and will be built into the browser, so you just need to browse as you normally would, and Microsoft Edge will let you know if any of the items you’ve recently looked at have changed in price,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176463"&gt;explains Liat Ben-Zur&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft executive working on the company’s “Modern Life” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Lkr0"&gt;It’s not clear yet how Microsoft will handle the obvious privacy concerns of its browser tracking products you’re searching for online and their associated prices. Microsoft has traditionally offered a number of privacy-focused controls in Edge, so we’d expect to see similar options here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29tn9e"&gt;Speaking of privacy, Edge is also getting a new useful password tool. Microsoft is piloting a new feature in Edge that will make it easy to update your passwords if they’re leaked online. Edge already monitors leaked passwords if you allow it to do so, and soon you’ll be able to navigate directly to a site’s change password page for affected credentials. Edge will then create a new, unique, and strong password. “Easy update is only available across a limited number of sites to start, but we will be working diligently to expand this list in the coming months,” says Ben-Zur.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s latest purchase is about becoming the place you listen to everything</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1FS21PcLxlLha9cNWrzdC9s79A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160401/acastro_211117_4888_0002.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Why it bought an audiobook company&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hMjQy9"&gt;Last week, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776777/spotify-findaway-acquire-audiobooks-podcasts-buy"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to spend an undisclosed amount of money to acquire Findaway, an audiobook creation and distribution company that plays a major role in the industry. The announcement likely made sense to anyone who’s been paying attention to Spotify’s audio moves, but for those who haven’t, to sum it up plainly: Spotify wants to be the place you consume all audio. This purchase sets it up to achieve that goal. When you open Spotify this time next year, the app will likely highlight an &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert &lt;/em&gt;episode alongside Taylor Swift’s newest single alongside Barack Obama’s newest book. It’ll be a crowded, but potentially powerful, destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Saykos"&gt;At the same time, though, Spotify getting knee-deep in audiobooks is a wildly different proposition than podcasts. There are powerful publishers to handle, a separate revenue model, a higher barrier to entry, and lots of IP rights to navigate. In the interest of better understanding why Spotify sees a future in the space, let’s break it down by what you need to know when thinking about this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHoywu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findaway is Anchor for audiobooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ctjsox"&gt;Let’s start with the most approachable idea for us podcast folks. Akin to how Spotify bought Anchor to make recording and publishing a podcast easy, Findaway plays a similar role in the audiobook space. Now, it’s not as easy as recording audio on your phone, overlaying some music, and pressing publish to make an audiobook, at least a quality one. Audiobooks often involve a narrator, if not actors, audio clips, and more. It’s usually on the level of a highly produced podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx056k"&gt;Findaway operates a business called Voices that sets authors up with a narrator and ensures content gets made well, but in exchange, authors pay Findaway to make that happen and use their services. This offers a clear business opportunity for Spotify. It’ll interface with creators, something it already does through Anchor and its music work, and generate revenue at the same time. It likely can improve on Findaway’s tech, too, given that it has an entire team dedicated to cracking on-the-go recording in Anchor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPUmUH"&gt;Once a book is recorded, Findaway can distribute it, too, which generates revenue. This leads us to the next thing to think about in relation to this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="jmMVIB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zH8rAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findaway turns Spotify into an audiobook distributor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qv5SCk"&gt;Spotify will now play an integral role in the audiobook world — major publishing houses entrust Findaway to distribute their content to retailers, libraries, and listening platforms. Unlike in podcasting where hosts have an RSS feed they can input wherever they want their show to populate, audiobook publishers and authors generally work with a distributor to get their content to storefronts and make sure all the data is properly inserted, among other things. Findaway’s solution is called &lt;a href="https://audioengine.io/"&gt;AudioEngine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="853R2K"&gt;Mark Pearson, the CEO and founder of Libro.fm, which sells audiobooks and supports independent bookstores, says this distribution business is critical to consider when thinking about Spotify’s deal. His platform works with Findaway to bring books to the Libro.fm app in some cases, and he says the reason many publishers distribute through Findaway is because “what we [on the app side] do on the backend is actually not trivial,” he says. “There’s a lot that goes into it with metadata and files and to deliver that in an app format for the listener is really hard work.” This would be a lot of labor for one organization to handle adequately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNFQ5a"&gt;One familiar podcasting company is also already working with Findaway for distribution of its audiobooks: author Malcolm Gladwell’s Pushkin Industries. CMO Heather Fain tells me the team partners with Findaway to distribute their audiobooks everywhere other than Audible. The reason to do so is because it’s easier than managing the plethora of places where a book populates. Findaway distributes the audiobooks and makes sure they show up properly across various apps and platforms, including Apple Books, Kobo, public libraries, and Libro.fm. (Yes, there could be a world in which Spotify is providing audiobooks to Apple.) However the distribution deal is structured, Findaway is making money, representing a new revenue line for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ3E9n"&gt;Finally, there’s one more aspect of this deal to think about: &lt;strong&gt;Spotify will become a bookseller&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBGYlD"&gt;With Findaway on its side and audiobooks now seemingly a priority, Spotify will likely start selling them from within the app. This could be essential for Spotify in its quest to be the place people can get all their audio. It’s a retention strategy — don’t move to Audible for your audiobooks, stay on Spotify — and also might recruit people to the platform if the offering is competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2yZ0g"&gt;If Spotify sells books a la carte, the margins will be much higher compared to podcasts. Even a CPM of $50 in podcasting means a podcaster is only making five cents per listener. Charging each listener $15 for access to an audiobook is a more lucrative arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPJSFn"&gt;Plus, Spotify gets to double-dip on revenue: anywhere Findaway is involved, Spotify makes money — as a retailer, as well as through audiobook production and distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYnfcK"&gt;Looking to the future, I imagine Spotify could end up offering different subscription tiers that allow paying subscribers to download an audiobook a month, a la Audible and others. It could also try to launch an unlimited audiobooks plan, like its Swedish competitor Storytel. There’s also the possibility of Spotify making an exclusives play where it signs deals with publishers and authors to bring books to its platform — a classic Audible move, but one that would make extra sense given Spotify’s penchant for exclusive podcasts. If Spotify can become a main place people buy and listen to audiobooks, in addition to all other audio, it also might be able to strong-arm publishers into putting more books on its platform at more favorable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WmNYig"&gt;If Spotify’s pace in the podcasting world is any indication, the audiobooks integration could happen fast. It only took Spotify two or so years to start claiming that it’s the top podcasting app. Can it do the same for audiobooks? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NFL is attaching NFTs to tickets, and the Lions Thanksgiving game is on the list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Philadelphia Eagles v Detroit Lions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5grE3J3uP8Pgxajj0w92Yy2Vak=/0x0:4662x3108/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160163/1350898110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Hey Jared, &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq" target="_blank"&gt;just read this&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll understand what NFTs are, ok?” | Photo by Nic Antaya/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKJCKz"&gt;Along with their usual dose of sports, beer, and violence, NFL fans will also get a digital token included with the purchase of tickets to certain games this season. Yes, they are &lt;a href="https://nfl.live-nfts.com/wallet"&gt;NFTs from the NFL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZYhvDz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The blockchain will never forget that you paid to see a Detroit Lions game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl1Hur"&gt;The first Virtual Commemorative Ticket game already happened on November 7th when the Cardinals played the 49ers, and the next one is scheduled for Thanksgiving during the Bears / Lions matchup. NFL club business development senior vice president Bobby Gallo says, “Leveraging the emerging world of NFTs is a new and exciting way for us to create additional value and to further engage with fans who attend select games by providing a virtual commemorative ticket. There is no better time than the upcoming holiday season to kick off this fun and engaging fan experience, starting with the Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions Thanksgiving Day matchup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FHdXIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Vi2Aj"&gt;While it’s hard to understand why anyone would want non-fungible evidence that they paid to see the &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/teams/detroit-lions/"&gt;0-8-1&lt;/a&gt; Detroit Lions play football on a holiday instead of spending time with their loved ones or simply staying home and doing nothing at all, this is happening. Selecting the holiday game to highlight this promotion means that sitting around with your family this year will definitely include discussing what NFTs are — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;our explainer can help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pxlz5R"&gt;Fans who are scanned into the game using a Ticketmaster SafeTix ticket that they purchased on their own account can obtain their NFT via a link sent to their registered email address after the game. Buying the tickets from Ticketmaster, StubHub, or SeatGeek will make you eligible for the promotion, which is powered by &lt;a href="https://help.ticketmaster.com/s/topic/0TO6Q0000000xEFWAY/nft?language=en_US"&gt;Ticketmaster’s NFT marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partial schedule of NFT NFL games and Lions / Bears commemorative image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xnUpYH"&gt;If you’re not attending the games in person but still want in, there are non-ticket NFTs on the way. The league says in an announcement, “In addition to the commemorative NFTs given to fans after attending select games, the marketplace will also offer a limited number of digital collectible NFTs across all 32 clubs for fans to purchase and collect. Fans will also have the opportunity to trade or sell their commemorative NFTs.” Later this season, the league &lt;a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-nflpa-and-dapper-labs-announce-new-nft-deal-to-create-exclusive-digital-vide"&gt;will partner&lt;/a&gt; with NBA Top Shot operator Dapper Labs to &lt;a href="https://nfl.dapperlabs.com/"&gt;sell digital video collectible NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XgQaao"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The NBA on NFT: Top Shot is playing the long game in the NFT craze","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"},{"title":"Topps is releasing official NFT baseball cards","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379645/topps-mlb-basecall-cards-nft-collectible-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eDMrNp"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.ticketmaster.com/nfl-virtual-commemorative-tickets/"&gt;an associated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, minting of these NFTs happens “on an eco-friendly blockchain with a low carbon footprint.” Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785051/nft-collectibles-intellectual-property-decentralized-disney"&gt;efforts to create a “decentralized Disney”&lt;/a&gt; based on blockchain tech or &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/for-1-3-million-an-nft-and-stake-in-a-mexican-soccer-team?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;promises of a team ownership stake&lt;/a&gt;, these items fall strictly into the collectible category. They don’t come associated with every ticket, simply every purchase on an eligible account, so it’s impossible to predict exactly how many there will be or potential future value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uyZOU"&gt;Still, if digitally registered icons take off like their proponents keep saying they will, there’s a chance that you might be able to sell your Giants / Eagles commemorative token to someone one day, just like a ticket stub or signed jersey. But if it’s for the Lions game, then don’t worry — your best bet for creating a collectible is if they find another &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/11/20/9746130/nfl-catch-rule-controversies-calvin-johnson-referees"&gt;new and exciting way&lt;/a&gt; to not win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5Bd4Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Starbucks Pickup store in NYC uses Amazon Go cashierless technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WCznJWQI3gvndwvkgqnunWZv0k=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160040/Starbucks_Pickup_with_Amazon_Go_003_1024x683.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Starbucks has opened an Amazon Go themed store in Manhattan | Starbucks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bP8p8b"&gt;Starbucks has opened a new “pickup cafe” in New York City that uses Amazon Go’s “just walk out” cashierless tech, the companies &lt;a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2021/starbucks-pickup-and-amazon-go-collaborate-to-launch-new-store-concept-in-new-york-city/"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The store in midtown Manhattan is designed for customers who want to buy coffee or a snack quickly and can’t possibly wait the extra minutes they’d normally spend interacting with a barista or cashier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuwBQl"&gt;The new store on 59th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues is one of three Starbucks Pickup locations the Seattle coffeemaker plans to open this year. It has the full Starbucks menu and a “curated assortment of food and beverages” in its Amazon Go market section, including sandwiches, salads, and snacks. Starbucks’ senior vice president of global growth and development, Katie Young, said in a statement that Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go (catchy branding, that) is “designed to provide our customers with an experience that delivers convenience and connection in an effortless way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57eTs8"&gt;Last year, Starbucks said in its third-quarter earnings call with investors that it had suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/starbucks-sbux-q3-2020-earnings.html"&gt;sharp drop in revenue&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/business/starbucks-closing-400-stores/index.html"&gt;planned to close hundreds of stores&lt;/a&gt; in the US and Canada. It also said it would be opening pickup locations in urban areas and double drive-thru lanes at some of its suburban stores. The company ultimately avoided layoffs, but some &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-employees-say-they-are-under-understaffed-and-underpaid-2021-5"&gt;Starbucks store workers have reported&lt;/a&gt; that their locations are understaffed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uIgHu"&gt;To get your coffee from this Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go location, preorder your drink using the Starbucks mobile app, choose the store at “59th between Park &amp;amp; Lex w/Amazon Go,” then head to the store where it will be waiting on a counter. Drink orders that are in progress will be displayed on a digital screen above the counter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZHZOl"&gt;The store has a lounge and seating area (which seems to contradict the “get in, get out fast” concept). To enter the Amazon Go market area and the seating area, you’ll use an in-store code from the Amazon app, then insert your credit card or scan the palm of your hand if you’re already registered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493094/amazon-one-palm-recognition-hand-payments-amazon-go-store"&gt;with its Amazon One&lt;/a&gt; program that launched in its Go stores in Seattle last year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aP5MyNfFlsojflba5k376mycRlY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024431/palm_scanner_amazon_go.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Starbucks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A scanner at the Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go store lets you enter payment information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QspPkz"&gt;As you take items off of shelves, they’ll be added to your virtual shopping cart; if you put them back, they’ll be removed from your cart. When you’re done shopping, you can leave or sit in the lounge and not interact with any other humans if that is what you prefer. Your card will be charged either way once you exit the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RflwZ"&gt;There will be Starbucks employees at the store to make the drinks and help customers as they shop. The new store will be open daily at 6AM and will stay open later than other Starbucks cafes, closing at 10PM on weekdays and 9PM on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After COVID boom, ebook aggregators face licensing questions from Congress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ieyv0A_Fe6wqCb2hUmoE3Bdt8iI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159908/akrales_181101_3056_0224.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcNVoh"&gt;A Democratic senator launched an investigation into how publishers license ebooks to libraries on Thursday, calling on nine major ebook aggregators to provide details on the licensing agreements they make with libraries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0SWcZ"&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), along with Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), sent letters demanding that aggregators like Overdrive and EBSCO provide them with examples of standard ebook licensing agreements for every major publisher they work with, including Penguin Random House and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vMl2Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many libraries face financial and practical challenges”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TyiLz1"&gt;“Many libraries face financial and practical challenges in making e-books available to their patrons, which jeopardizes their ability to fulfill their mission,” the lawmakers wrote. “It is our understanding that these difficulties arise because e-books are typically offered under more expensive and limited licensing agreements, unlike print books that libraries can typically purchase, own, and lend on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beeLuN"&gt;In September, Wyden and Eshoo first questioned publishers over the terms they set for ebook licensing. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many public libraries to shut down in-person service, and people began using online services like Overdrive’s Libby app to borrow digital books in lieu of physical copies. “Ensuring that libraries can offer an array of resources, including e-books, is essential to promoting equity in education and access to information,” the lawmakers wrote &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/092321%20Wyden%20Eshoo%20Letter%20to%20Penguin%20Random%20House.pdf"&gt;to Penguin Random House&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6EdVJ"&gt;Major publishers have sued organizations in the past over copyright violations for offering free copies of ebooks. In June 2020, Hachette, Penguin Random House, Wiley, and HarperCollins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277036/internet-archive-publishers-lawsuit-open-library-ebook-lending"&gt;filed suit against the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; for copyright violations related to the Open Library project. The project launched in 2006 and allowed users to borrow ebooks scanned from physical copies of books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIZ7oq"&gt;In Thursday’s letters, the lawmakers highlighted how digital versions of books can be more accessible to people with disabilities. “In recent years, e-books have been a growing part of library catalogs. Not only do many library users prefer to borrow e-books, but digital options can provide greater accessibility for Americans who have disabilities, face mobility challenges, or live in remote areas,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssOpiM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cZoJu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is an unsettling and beautiful Radiohead art exhibit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCbnT489eNAsSlnD9RKZNxPyiTo=/0x35:2720x1848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159930/IMG_1352.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I watched some Radiohead concert footage with my good friend here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition isn’t a traditional video game&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pUIRc3"&gt;The simplest description of &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s essentially a virtual Radiohead art museum featuring music from &lt;em&gt;Kid A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Amnesiac&lt;/em&gt;. If that’s enough to pique your interest in the slightest, I highly recommend you stop reading this and just play the game, which is available Thursday for free on PC, Mac, and PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5M9c6"&gt;Calling &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; an art museum doesn’t really do it justice, though. Sure, much of the game is spent navigating through hallways of Radiohead-themed art while clips and bits of songs from &lt;em&gt;Kid A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Amnesiac&lt;/em&gt; waft in and out of your consciousness. One room, for example, is piled high with televisions with constantly changing images while unnerving yet familiar versions of melodies from “The National Anthem” warble around you. It wouldn’t feel out of place at a modern art exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j61e4D"&gt;But then you can do the extremely video game-y thing of walking right into an amber column in the middle of the room to bring up the song’s iconic drum and bass lines, which were previously absent. When you step out of the column, the drum and bass fade away, and the unsettling warbles return. There are a lot of moments like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QagOY1rFTpLvewZI18aGQ8RDWiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23023327/IMG_1357.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now just imagine that you’re hearing “The National Anthem.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aLdpOy"&gt;That said, &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition &lt;/em&gt;isn’t a traditional video game. There are no enemies. You can’t die. The only actions you can take are to zoom in on things, move around the world, and up your pace from a slow walk to a gentle trot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VM1ZBM"&gt;I was still surprised to find the experience unsettling at times, though. You’ll see the sharp-toothed smile from Radiohead’s logo all over the place. Wisps of pixels will float across your vision like ghastly spirits. Living stick figures wandering the halls will silently appear behind you as they take in the art. The music, even if it is ingrained into the folds of your brain after years of repeated listens like it is for me, can be dissonant and uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvj3Pq"&gt;But it wouldn’t be a Radiohead project without some awe-inspiring beauty. In one room, papers covering the floor and ceiling will whip in the wind to deconstruct and reconstruct the room around you. One striking sequence is like an interactive music visualizer. And my favorite moments in the game were spent with a little devil-like creature and watching clips of old Radiohead live shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMpOA_X77iiRm-uCXhhUz9wB8r4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23023331/IMG_1344.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game is full of strikingly beautiful rooms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhpjHx"&gt;To see the best of what &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&lt;/em&gt; has to offer, you should take your time. My first trip took a little over an hour, but the rooms evolve in some remarkable ways that you might miss if you rush through. Putting down the controller to observe how the music and the exhibits shift and change is very rewarding. While writing this article, I left the game idling in a few different areas, and I saw and heard a lot that I had missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADf4ud"&gt;If you’re a Radiohead fan, &lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent way to experience two of the band’s iconic albums in a new format. But even if you haven’t memorized all of the lyrics on both albums, the game is still worth checking out as a very literal expression of the idea that video games can be art. Sometimes, it’s nice to just sit and listen to some music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBFw8X"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kid A Mnesia Exhibition is available Thursday as a free download for PC, Mac, and PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will finally let you preorder the new 23W Pixel Stand for $79</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6oYkGhRyRFps8PrUOzgjqc3YJoI=/282x0:1361x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159858/pixelstand2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aeAeDq"&gt;Despite more than a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735046/google-pixel6-store-r013-r008-error-preorder-buy"&gt;issues with the preorder process&lt;/a&gt; and shipping, Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have made their way into the world, and now the company is ready to sell an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging%5D"&gt;upgraded version of its Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; for wireless charging on your desk or side table. &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;This new stand costs $79&lt;/a&gt;, just like the first-gen model did when it launched in 2018 with the Pixel 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qalBMB"&gt;Like the original, it automatically adjusts the phone’s UI for docked use to pull up photo frames or shortcuts to your Nest Security cameras and can switch into do not disturb mode at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAt7Yn"&gt;However, this time around, Google is trying to justify that relatively high price by offering faster charging. The new Pixel Stand can charge compatible phones at up to 23 watts, which, coincidentally, is the fastest rate you can get with the Pixel 6 Pro, while the Pixel 6 tops out at around 21 watts. That’s a bit disappointing when plugged into a 30W charger but gets more acceptable with the convenience of wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Plxw1e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google explains the tradeoffs that led to Pixel 6’s slow charging complaints ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788960/pixel-6-pro-charging-speeds-30w-21w-23w-slow-charge-battery-life"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wJoLgu"&gt;How does that compare to the newest iPhone 13 models? The fastest charging available falls short of the 27W-capable iPhone 13 Pro Max when plugged into a compatible charger, even though Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;MagSafe faster wireless charging peaks at 15 watts&lt;/a&gt; and 12 watts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691602/iphone-13-mini-slower-magsafe-charging-speeds-12w"&gt;on the iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nfXBI4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet the second-gen Pixel Stand from Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a superfast wireless charger with up to 23W of power. It works with compatible Pixel phones, Pixel Buds, and Qi-certified mobile devices.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more at the Google Store: &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHKgynxEEY"&gt;https://t.co/mHKgynxEEY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RisoqJzIKw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RisoqJzIKw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1461335150856388608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x2UI8w"&gt;As promised, the new Pixel Stand has a fan inside that Google says is quiet enough to keep things cool even if you’re charging while taking a long video call, a 30W PD 3.0 USB-C power adapter, and it can charge non-Pixel Qi-certified devices at up to 15W. The 30W charger and cable alone cost $35, but you won’t get faster charging whether you’re plugged in or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnihwo"&gt;Orders for the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;new 23W Pixel Stand on the Google Store are open now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipping dates predicted for early- to mid-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SZ6B4"&gt;If you like the design and the software tweaks but don’t need the speed, the original Stand is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-stand-fast-wireless-charger-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F22788072%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on Woot for $28.99&lt;/a&gt;. While that’s a deep discount from the original price, and it comes with an 18W power adapter in the box, it’s still $5 to $10 more than similar wireless chargers that may work just as well, like Belkin’s 10W stand for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086KZWRDB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24.99&lt;/a&gt; or Anker’s PowerWave Stand that doesn’t come with a power adapter but is on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBXZZN3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$19.49&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
