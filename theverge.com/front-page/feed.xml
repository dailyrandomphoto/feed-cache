    <title>Don’t take Nvidia’s word for it — try Nvidia’s awesome new image comparison tool, instead  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jiw9Co"&gt;Nvidia wants you to know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)&lt;/a&gt; is a mere pretender, nothing like the Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technique its GPUs can use to boost the framerate and/or image quality of your games. To prove it, Nvidia is trying an interesting new tactic by releasing a remarkably powerful image comparison tool called Nvidia ICAT, for free, so that anyone can see for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qX0zL"&gt;ICAT, short for “Image Comparison And Analysis,” is a very simple program that lets you view a stack of gameplay screenshots and even recorded videos side-by-side, automatically lining up the frames, and allowing you to fluidly pan across each scene, zoom in and out, on &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of those images or videos &lt;em&gt;simultaneously. &lt;/em&gt;It’s got a drag-and-drop interface that makes pixel peeping child’s play, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769156/iphone-13-pro-vs-pixel-6-pro-camera-comparison-photos"&gt;and as known pixel peepers&lt;/a&gt;, you’d better believe &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is going to be using it for more than just gaming graphics! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1hPNNhVqLmp-sxcwyaNZXRgvgQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018127/nvidia_icat_verge_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s new ICAT tool in action. There’s also an image slider mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HRopCk"&gt;But Nvidia’s hope, again, is to show how poor AMD’s FSR is compared to DLSS — or even Nvidia’s own, separate spatial upscaling technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JrCJY"&gt;In case you need a brief primer: &lt;strong&gt;Spatial upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; techniques, like AMD FSR, run each of your game’s video frames one at a time through a fixed algorithm — and they don’t require a special GPU to run. Nvidia’s DLSS, on the other hand, is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;temporal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; technique that compares multiple frames and takes account of how things are moving in a video game scene, and processes all that using a neural network that runs exclusively on the Tensor cores you can only find in an Nvidia RTX GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVirmcTpJkFMIYutOrKlUg3Qu88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018071/temporal_spacial_nvidia.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia illustrates how temporal and spatial upscaling differ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GvZrVb"&gt;But before you say “that’s great Nvidia, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776567/evga-line-queue-to-get-nvidia-rtx-3000-graphics-card-works"&gt;I can’t actually buy your new GPUs!&lt;/a&gt;” you should probably know that Nvidia has its own spatial upscaler as well, dubbed Nvidia Image Scaling. It’s apparently been buried in the Nvidia Control Panel for some time now, and today Nvidia is open-sourcing it on GitHub with its own SDK and support for every brand of GPU. Developers can natively integrate it into their games if they want, just like AMD’s FSR. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZw8lIqddEAhoeFtINvcq_qgXmw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018097/image_scaling_sdk.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pd1FHxDnVtUXO7nUOegRUWt9s64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018104/nvidia_sharpness_slider.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AfLzPU"&gt;And, the company’s baking Nvidia Image Scaling into its GeForce Experience app so you can turn it on for any game, and adjust an in-game sharpness slider (so you can see the difference) using Nvidia’s overlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRTWTo"&gt;Is it as good as Nvidia’s DLSS? Not even close, and Nvidia’s the first to admit it. In a briefing with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, product manager Henry Lin hammered us with example after example of how DLSS (particularly the new DLSS 2.3, which suffers from less ghosting around moving objects) not only beats the pants off of Nvidia’s own spatial upscaler, but sometimes performs better than a native image. Particularly when you’re looking at thin objects with lots of edges that tend to flicker:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The communications dish is crisper and less aliased with DLSS." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhG49x9kBDmAByVG-_IuzN83lVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018114/spatial_upscaler_vs_dlss_briefing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pictured communications dish is one place DLSS has an advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="viO3HL"&gt;Personally, I’ve sworn by native resolution all the way — but Nvidia’s ICAT made me curious enough to put it to the test. So I fired up &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, two games that offer both AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS, on a 4K screen at their highest quality modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOSXr4"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt;, I felt vindicated. Every part of the image looked fuller, crisper, and higher resolution at native 4K, up to and including the roof-mounted antenna:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZjKcx7jFn2mDeJa2h_rwBLPjr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018153/nvidia_icat_verge_b4b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll want to tap to zoom and/or download, this is a 4K image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PGW6Ia"&gt;There were even parts of the scene where AMD FSR clearly beat Nvidia DLSS, like all of these wooden textures:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xAFXygM2rGuL-riD-Kh-i2KtRgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018154/nvidia_icat_verge_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe Nvidia’s neural network needs more experience with wood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="13IMFh"&gt;But when I tried out &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, it was the opposite story: almost everywhere I looked, DLSS was resolving and preserving details I couldn’t even see at native resolution, and with far, far less flicker from distant aliased objects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0B2lrXQZPuNPwENllnlkDZczbVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018227/nvidia_icat_verge_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Deathloop, the VW bus in the background looks decidedly less cartoony with DLSS, and you can see far more detail in distant textures. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lTZ85YWBntbB8eV6lqN3Y-c8DZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018242/flicker_deathloop_native.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Native 4K, blown up to show detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVRvlbyGzb195HW6AgVMdOZcb7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018241/flicker_deathloop_dlss.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DLSS Quality, at the same size. Less flicker, more detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uic9RB"&gt;That said, I still saw moments in &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; where DLSS does weird things, too. Scroll up to the top of this post for one example: you can see how DLSS totally changed the sparkly finish of the Strelak Verso pistols and muddies the texture of the dirt ground in the exact same scene as my other screenshots and GIFs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxkYOe"&gt;I’m not a believer in DLSS quite yet, but I’m intrigued. Nvidia’s promise is that, with enough learning, games can actually look better &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; run faster than native with DLSS turned on. For now, it’s something developers have to enable on a per-game basis, and not all games have the same version to offer, but that could change down the road. Nvidia’s Lin tells me that &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;already features over-the-air DLSS updates — when you open the game, it can check with the Nvidia driver to see if there’s a new version and hot swap it at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO81r0"&gt;“Wherever you see DLSS not match native, that’s what we’ll be working on,” says Lin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7x3Hq"&gt;We’ll add a link to Nvidia’s new ICAT tool when we spot it live on the company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUeS26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UH7OW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6bbRX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>1Password 8 arrives on Windows with a new design and big performance improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3p3vr11wdY-XcLAIrtfVtoZ6t8=/80x0:2480x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148701/Dark___1Password_8_for_Windows_hero_image__unlocked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password 8 now includes a dark mode for Windows.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: AgileBits&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqIpIM"&gt;1Password is getting its first major design update in more than three years today, with the launch of 1Password 8 for Windows. It includes a new design with a dark mode that better matches some of the recent UI improvements across Windows 10 and Windows 11. 1Password is also now built on Rust, to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weY4d4"&gt;The entire desktop app now looks a lot more like the web or 1Password browser extension interface, with updated item icons, detailed views for items and vaults, and a redesigned sidebar. There’s also a new quick find feature and improvements to search results to make it easier to find the login entry you need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KPPzoVtAIrzOSAhSFU-k3C5tyYE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018397/NextLevelEditing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AgileBits&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The editing experience in 1Password 8 is a lot easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rfyvPD"&gt;It’s also a lot easier to edit entries now, with a new password generator and the ability to add files directly into items. 1Password 8 also includes a security questions feature, if there are still websites out there that need this type of login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjVBXb"&gt;Underneath the new design, 1Password is now built on Rust which should improve performance and security. “You won’t see this change but you’ll feel it,” &lt;a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/"&gt;said 1Password founder Dave Teare&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “The app is incredibly responsive across the board, from unlocking to adding accounts to searching your items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLqA9B"&gt;If you use this dedicated 1Password Windows app with the browser extension, both will share a login state and you can even use Windows Hello for easier unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MvfUO"&gt;The new 1Password 8 update is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://1password.com/downloads/windows/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available now for Windows users&lt;/a&gt;, and is still in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619846/1password-8-macos-early-access-password-manager-app"&gt;early access mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s Black Screen of Death is changing back to blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGJnZKj5gvMjIhjWV4OoGJAyFbg=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148382/windows11bsod.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="31lKyR"&gt;Microsoft is changing its Black Screen of Death in Windows 11 back to the original blue color. The software giant originally changed its infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change"&gt;to black in Windows 11 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, to match the new black logon and shutdown screens. It was the first major change to the BSOD since Microsoft added a sad face to the screen in Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxuxIL"&gt;That change is now being reverted in a Windows 11 update that’s due to be released any day now. “We changed the screen color to blue when a device stops working or a stop error occurs as in previous versions of Windows,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/12/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-346-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;admits Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in recent patch notes, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/blue-screen-death-will-return-windows-11"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for the Windows 11 update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdIZQr"&gt;Microsoft first introduced the BSOD in Windows 3.0, offering a way for IT professionals and support personnel to diagnose hardware and memory faults. A BSOD is Windows’ own kernel error, and it typically includes a dump of data that IT admins can analyze to determine what is causing the crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvEXR3"&gt;It’s not clear why the BSOD is going back to blue in Windows 11, but it could be related to IT support calls. The Blue Screen of Death has long been part of Windows, and is an easy way for end users to spot a problem and call IT support. Imagine a scenario where IT admins are trying to troubleshoot issues remotely in a pandemic, and it’s easy to see where a black screen, that’s often associated with monitor issues, could be more confusing than the Blue Screen of Death everyone is used to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s cashierless tech makes first appearance in a rival store outside the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jF_p2rJquYenX--Veewg-IhxmmQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148378/vpavic_181024_3050_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Amazon Go store in the US in 2018. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PbATE1"&gt;Amazon has reportedly landed its first customer outside the US for its cashierless retail technology. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/amazon-s-cashierless-tech-will-power-sainsbury-market-in-london?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the UK’s second largest supermarket chain, Sainsbury’s, will use Amazon’s system of AI-powered surveillance cameras to power a cashierless grocery store in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7lgOn"&gt;Sainsbury’s own FAQ &lt;a href="https://png.sainsburys.co.uk/"&gt;for the store&lt;/a&gt;, which is reportedly due to open to the public on November 29, says that the technology is being provided by an unnamed “third-party supplier.” But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;says that supplier is Amazon, citing a source “familiar with the matter.” We reached out to Sainsbury’s for comment but the company provided only a generic statement saying it was “currently testing” cashierless tech at the store in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG6YQe"&gt;The shop, located near Sainsbury’s headquarters on High Holborn, will use machine learning technology and cameras to track what shoppers pick up. Customers scan in and out of the store with a QR code on the Sainsbury’s app and are charged automatically for any items they leave the premises with. Sainsbury’s says the system doesn’t use facial recognition, doesn’t share customers’ account data with the tech’s supplier, and that images collected by the cameras are “usually” deleted within 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JhdvFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon now operates dozens of cashierless stores in the US and UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ydu7Lr"&gt;Amazon’s cashierless tech first launched to the public in 2018 with a single Amazon Go store in Seattle. The company now has a few dozen US locations as well as six stores in the UK, where the shops are known as Amazon Fresh. The US tech giant has also been selling its systems to other retailers, including three in the US (Hudson markets, OTG CIBO Express, and Delaware North) and, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report, Sainsbury’s in the UK. The company markets its system as “Just Walk Out” technology. It’s also been slowly expanding the tech to cover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;larger grocery stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6ztce"&gt;There have been some questions about the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-07-18/amazon-s-most-ambitious-research-project-is-a-convenience-store?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;viability of Amazon’s technology&lt;/a&gt; — particularly whether the expense of its systems is actually worth it for retailers. But the slow expansion of Amazon’s stores as well as similar offerings from rival tech startups and retailers suggest the idea has some innate appeal. Or, at least, companies don’t want to find themselves outmaneuvered by Amazon and so are racing to keep up with the tech giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CIHZn"&gt;On London’s High Holborn alone, you can now find three cashierless grocery stores (though only one is currently open to the public). In addition to the Sainsbury’s shop there’s an Amazon Fresh (the &lt;a href="https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2021/11/3/seventh-amazon-fresh-store-set-to-open-holborn-london"&gt;company’s seventh in London&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfaithfull/2021/10/21/tesco-getgo-learns-from-amazon-to-debut-london-shop-and-go-store/"&gt;first ever cashierless store from Tesco&lt;/a&gt;, built using technology from Israeli startup Trigo.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest Maps features help you avoid the holiday shopping crowds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EE6A07SbcvG2Dy6FR68ru4Uz_l4=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148221/image__7_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Busy area” label appears when you might encounter crowds.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LJ3LEG"&gt;Google is adding a handful of new features to Google Maps in time for the holiday season, which collectively should make getting around a slightly less fraught experience. The new features were announced in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/keep-it-chill-holiday-new-tools-google-maps/"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57R7lb"&gt;A new “Area Busyness” feature provides information on how popular neighborhoods are rather than just specific destinations, while the app’s “Directory” tab is rolling out globally to give more info on the stores and amenities &lt;em&gt;inside &lt;/em&gt;locations like malls and airports. Google Maps is also expanding its grocery pickup tracking feature to cover more stores across the US, and is attempting to make its restaurant reviews more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUFc3ZJYzTY-m9y4LIhD8wwIs8Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018380/ezgif.com_gif_maker_3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Directory tab gives information about stores and amenities inside large complexes like airports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9X3J9"&gt;Area Busyness is an expansion of the information Google Maps already provides about the crowdedness of public transit and the popularity of specific stores and locations throughout the week. Now, rather than just offering details on specific places, Google Maps will be able to give information on how busy a general neighborhood is. Google hopes that the feature will be able to both let users avoid crowds, or hunt them down if they’re in the mood for a party atmosphere. Google says that Area Busyness will be rolling out globally on Android and iOS “in time for this holiday season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuTPMA"&gt;Meanwhile, the Directory tab will be available for any airports, malls, and transit stations around the world where Google has data available. It shows which amenities (such as airport lounges and parking lots) and stores are available inside places that are often shown as just a single location in Google Maps. Then, the app can provide granular information like opening hours and customer ratings. The Directory tab will also be available globally on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sm8UOP"&gt;The service’s restaurant reviews are also getting more detailed, with additional information on price ranges. It’s also simplifying the process of adding information on facilities like outdoor seating and delivery options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jh4Dzv"&gt;Google Maps is also expanding its grocery pickup feature, which lets users track their order status and then share with the store when they expect to arrive for collection without ever leaving the app. The feature was first launched earlier this year, and has since expanded to cover over 2,000 stores across 30 US states including Kroger Family stores like Kroger, Fry’s, Ralphs and Marianos, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsKSVj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19kRXr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTuVC5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s Naruto collab includes more than just skins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K76CmP4KTW92r7UA0rFqGJqQT04=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148104/18BR_Naruto_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Characters from &lt;/em&gt;Naruto Shippuden&lt;em&gt; are joining &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GRrwuk"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1458555063534854145"&gt;a tease last week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s highly anticipated collaboration with &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/naruto-x-fortnite-is-finally-here"&gt;is finally here&lt;/a&gt;. Starting Tuesday, you’ll be able to play as characters from the hugely popular anime series &lt;em&gt;Naruto: Shippuden&lt;/em&gt; in Epic Games’ hit battle royale. There will be four &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; characters that are now available in the in-game item shop — Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake — as well as a &lt;em&gt;Naruto &lt;/em&gt;glider, two emotes, and two loading screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcDdV5"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just getting &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; skins. A throwable paper bomb kunai is being added as a weapon to the game. You’ll be able to meet Kakashi Hatake as an NPC on the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island and get quests from him. And there will be an entire &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt;-themed Creative map you can explore based on the Hidden Leaf Village from the anime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QaRbKufooKLwTOeOy6zQYiK4Slk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007349/18BR_Naruto_ShinobiTeamworkLoadingScreen.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You’ll soon see &lt;/em&gt;Naruto&lt;em&gt; characters hopping off the battle bus.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MhifVo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; takeover is the latest of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s many extensive collaborations with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;other huge entertainment properties&lt;/a&gt;. Previous hits included the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/14/21020296/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-fortnite-jj-abrams-lightsabers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; lightsabers as a weapon&lt;/a&gt; and an entire season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;dedicated to Marvel characters and locations&lt;/a&gt;. While the current season isn’t tied to any existing brand — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;instead, it’s full of cubes&lt;/a&gt; — the introduction of &lt;em&gt;Naruto&lt;/em&gt; characters brings some anime ninja action to the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; island.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Balmuda Phone is a compact Android phone from a high-end toaster company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKeX3hdAWiaNxxPC4GogvZITY8w=/0x0:3339x2226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70148021/7ABABA5A_D83B_498D_9F33_08E0C80D8CE5.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pt1nF"&gt;Japanese design company Balmuda today announced its first smartphone at a press event in Tokyo. The straightforwardly titled Balmuda Phone is the debut product from Balmuda Technologies, a new division of the company previously known for stylish, premium home appliances like air purifiers and rice cookers. Balmuda’s toaster in particular has a cult following in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqEM2i"&gt;As you’d expect, the Balmuda Phone is quite a bit different to other phones on the market. CEO Gen Terao said on stage that he felt that smartphones have gotten too big and unwieldy in recent years, so the Balmuda Phone was designed with compactness and elegance as the primary goals. It has a very sharp 4.9-inch 16:9 1080p display and is roughly comparable to a 4.7-inch iPhone SE; the display is slightly bigger and the phone is 2mm wider, but the smaller bezels mean it’s 15mm shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN__psLPI6HAZ0JLLqx4FcYmkaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018299/913677DF_0F3E_4043_89E8_3AEDC7B09DF4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone is much thicker in the middle than on the edges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P0QexY"&gt;The Balmuda Phone is a full 13.7mm thick at its thickest point, but the back panel tapers down heavily toward the edges. There’s a single large camera with a 48-megapixel sensor in the top right corner, and a similar-looking cutout in the top left houses a fingerprint sensor. The 8-megapixel selfie camera is housed in a hole-punch cutout at the top right of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XHTgf"&gt;The phone’s specs are generally mid-range. The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 and there’s 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is just 2,500mAh, which will hopefully be offset somewhat by the lower-power processor, though we’ll have to test for ourselves to see. The phone does thankfully have wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arA421"&gt;Where Balmuda is really differentiating itself is with design. It’s a well-worn tech writing cliche to say that something “feels good in the hand,” but that was clearly Balmuda’s intent here with the compact size and curved back that nestles into your palm like a pebble. I have big hands, granted, but I think just about anyone would find this more comfortable to use than the hefty 6-inch slabs most of us carry around these days. While the case is plastic, build quality feels solid and there’s a nice contrast between the textured back panel and the glossy edges. All in all it’s a cute, attractive object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2rl_ANrYzkkReSjuhmQ1rPu8ur0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018298/1C8A4701_958F_4569_B34D_2A9B396E407A.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Balmuda Phone has a textured plastic back and comes in black or white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9QdLYwVGs4Ir1fsShFoeNDs55Ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23018304/IMG_0777.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Balmuda’s built-in calendar app, which syncs with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNb9Ee"&gt;The software, based on Android 11, is also very different to what you’d find on most Android phones today. There’s an interactive home screen with various elements of the wallpaper customizable for different shortcuts; for example, you could swipe on one of the lines to launch Google Maps. Horizontal swipes move you between some of the built-in software, like a calendar, a notes app, and a calculator. All of these had neat design touches, like the notes app’s visual timeline of photos and memos, or the calculator app’s built-in currency conversion and ability to handle large Japanese numbers that are counted in the 10,000s rather than the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEkgcb"&gt;The Balmuda Phone will be available in Japan on contract with SoftBank later this month, and Balmuda is selling an unlocked model itself for 104,800 yen (about $920). That might sound like a lot for a compact Android 11 phone with these specs, but then $329 probably sounds like a lot for a toaster, too. In both cases, you’re paying for the design and the user experience rather than the bill of materials, and this clearly isn’t aimed at anyone who wants a conventional Android flagship. As someone who does own Balmuda’s toaster, I’m looking forward to finding out how well the phone holds up under general use — because much as I like the toaster, a smartphone is a lot more important to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JPMorgan says Tesla owes the bank $162 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRd3uJAKHapevvd14e-KOI3f_AY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70147363/acastro_191204_1777_elon_legal_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YKoeUc"&gt;JPMorgan has sued Tesla, claiming that the electric car company owes the bank $162 million related to a 2014 stock warrant agreement. The dispute centers around adjustments the companies made to the agreement following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 “[f]unding secured” tweet and the resulting fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XO2MqN"&gt;The lawsuit was filed late Monday &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891/gov.uscourts.nysd.569891.1.0.pdf"&gt;in the Southern District of New York&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has disbanded its US press team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUbC4a"&gt;According to the suit, which was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/jpmorgan-sues-tesla-162-mln-related-warrants-2021-11-15/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, JPMorgan purchased a number of warrants from Tesla in 2014 — back when the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-28/tesla-raises-2-billion-with-convertible-debt-to-finance-factory"&gt;was still trying to fund the construction of the original Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmXzLm"&gt;Stock warrants give the buyer (JPMorgan, in this case) a right to purchase shares in a company (Tesla) at a set price within a certain window of time. The warrants JPMorgan bought from Tesla in 2014 were set to expire in June and July of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV2x4a"&gt;Initially, the companies agreed to a “strike price” of $560.6388. If the warrants expired and Tesla’s stock price was less than that strike price, neither company would owe the other anything. But if Tesla’s stock price was above the strike price at expiration, JPMorgan says Musk’s company was basically supposed to hand over stock equal to the difference in those prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xt0HaJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;JPMorgan could change the price of the warrants if Tesla announced a merger or acquisition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DIy5Qd"&gt;Being a massive, complicated financial transaction, JPMorgan made sure there were all sorts of legal protections in place. One was a hedge against any big announcements related to mergers or buyouts that could affect Tesla’s stock price. If something like that were to come along, the bank and the automaker were able to agree on a new strike price for the warrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJFqKc"&gt;Which brings us to the tweet. Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering"&gt;famously tweeted on August 7th, 2018&lt;/a&gt; that he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Later that day, Tesla’s chief financial officer, its head of communications, and its chief lawyer wrote an email attributed to Musk that was published on Tesla’s blog explaining his announcement. Musk also tweeted that “[i]nvestor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.” Tesla’s investor relations head also told some press that there was a “firm offer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3tkLk"&gt;Basically none of that was true, though, as everyone found out after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk and Tesla&lt;/a&gt; over the announcement. Musk had a cursory conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, but that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaEnO"&gt;Before that truth came out, though, JPMorgan saw the resulting volatility in Tesla’s stock price and decided to amend the strike price of its warrants. It lowered the price to $424.66 and notified Tesla. Tesla agreed to a conference call scheduled for August 24th, but backed out at the last minute, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5mcLY"&gt;That same day, Tesla and Musk announced that they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17780714/elon-musk-tesla-staying-public"&gt;abandoning the attempt to take Tesla private&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDxBkA"&gt;So JPMorgan once again decided to adjust the strike price of the warrants. It made new calculations based on the response to the decision by Tesla and Musk to do an about-face, and settled on a strike price of $484.35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="gKx0Dd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla allegedly ghosted JPMorgan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0pBCt"&gt;This time, Tesla “protested that no adjustment should be necessary at all because it had so quickly abandoned its going-private plans,” JPMorgan writes in its lawsuit. The bank gave Tesla its calculations and “held several conference calls” to explain them, and says Tesla “did not provide any specific objection” to those explanations. After that, JPMorgan says Tesla stopped talking to the bank for six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dc4PB"&gt;Tesla’s lawyers eventually sent a letter to JPMorgan in February 2019 claiming that the bank’s adjustments were “unreasonably swift and represented an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in Tesla’s stock.” JPMorgan wrote back, “rejecting all of [Tesla’s] allegations,” but then the two sides didn’t talk for two years. JPMorgan made another adjustment down to $96.87 in August 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364073/tesla-five-way-stock-split-august-21-plan-approved-shares-accessible-cheaper"&gt;account for Tesla’s stock split&lt;/a&gt;, and says Tesla never responded to that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1sLc0"&gt;By the time the expiration dates came around this year, Tesla’s stock was already on an incredible run and JPMorgan’s warrants were “‘in the money’ by a substantial amount,” according to the suit. When the bank contacted Tesla to cash out, Tesla “renewed its objections to the Adjustments.” Tesla did settle some shares with JPMorgan — the bank did not say how many — but “refused to settle in full,” the bank claims, so it triggered an “early termination” clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYF74U"&gt;JPMorgan says Tesla still owed 228,775 shares when it terminated the deal, and that those shares are worth $162,216,628.81 based on Tesla’s stock price at the time. (Potentially worse for JPMorgan, it had hedged its warrant agreement with Tesla by maintaining a short position against Tesla’s stock. When Tesla didn’t settle the remaining shares, the bank had to buy the same amount on the open market to cover that hedged bet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu6UZE"&gt;Shortly after the suit was filed on Monday, Musk was still actively tweeting in a thread he started Sunday in &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/tesla-ceo-elon-musks-twitter-fight-with-bernie-sanders-on-tax-policy.html"&gt;response to a Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) tweet&lt;/a&gt; about taxes. “I like to dig my grave real deep,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1460411507066425351"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IATSE members vote to ratify contracts that include better streaming pay</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNMnqt"&gt;A major Hollywood union has voted to ratify a pair of contracts to improve labor conditions for production workers — though narrowly — after previously voting to authorize a strike over stalled negotiations with major studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Evis"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) &lt;a href="https://iatse.net/iatse-members-ratify-contracts-with-producers-studios-and-streaming-services/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; its members narrowly voted to ratify both the Basic Agreement and the Area Standards Agreement, three-year contracts that included provisions for things like meal times and breaks, increased base pay for the union’s lowest-paid members, and better terms for productions from streaming services. Both votes were extraordinarily close, and the vote around the Basic Agreement, in particular, is contentious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJLX7d"&gt;IATSE uses an electoral college-like voting system (delegates are assigned to IATSE’s local unions based on their number of members). Delegate votes leaned yes for both contracts, and 52 percent of members voted in favor of the Area Standards Agreement (48 percent voted no). But the popular vote for the Basic Agreement shook out to 50.4 percent no to 49.6 percent yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MbKND"&gt;The union said that 72 percent of its 63,209 members, or 45,402 members total, participated in the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSg6rM"&gt;“Our goal was to achieve fair contracts that work for IATSE members in television and film—that address quality-of-life issues and conditions on the job like rest and meal breaks,” IATSE international president Matthew Loeb said in a statement. “We met our objectives for this round of bargaining and built a strong foundation for future agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9LGJ3"&gt;It was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749253/hollywood-union-itsea-amptp-vote-streaming-pay"&gt;high-stakes vote&lt;/a&gt; for the union, which previously voted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;authorize a strike&lt;/a&gt; when negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) — which represents studios like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Disney, among others — came to a standstill. That strike was narrowly avoided in October after the parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22731087/hollywood-union-reaches-contract-agreement-iatse-avoids-strike"&gt;reached agreements&lt;/a&gt; just days before the strike was scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl1kU0"&gt;“From start to finish, from preparation to ratification, this has been a democratic process to win the very best contracts,” Loeb said. “The vigorous debate, high turnout, and close election, indicates we have an unprecedented movement-building opportunity to educate members on our collective bargaining process and drive more participation in our union long-term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxIhwh"&gt;While streaming was a small part of a much larger push for better labor protections for production workers, the negotiations highlighted how rapidly the industry has evolved amid the streaming wars. The union argued that streamers were underpaying for production work, and part of the contract terms include provisions for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735892/iatses-tentative-basic-agreement-streaming-pay"&gt;higher rates&lt;/a&gt; primarily based on the type of content being created.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is suing its rivals over its on-demand classes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdlGa6"&gt;Peloton isn’t too happy with its rivals. The company has filed lawsuits against Echelon and iFit, claiming each company violated patents related to Peloton’s on-demand classes, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/peloton-sues-ifit-echelon-over-new-patent-for-on-demand-classes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aI2w24"&gt;The issue at hand is that Peloton says Echelon and iFit are gaining “free rides” from its technology. In court documents, the company specifically pointed to its leaderboards and the ability to participate in live classes with other users. In its case against iFit, Peloton says that before it came along, iFit “only allowed subscribers to follow along with pre-recorded exercise classes on their machines, without any sort of community engagement.” It also takes issue with iFit’s ActivePulse and SmartAdjust features, which automatically adjust things like workout speeds based on a specific class. Peloton introduced a similar feature on its Bike Plus called auto-follow, which adjusts the bike’s resistance during a workout without requiring you to fiddle with the resistance knob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzeKfz"&gt;Peloton claims that dozens of iFit and Echelon products have profited off Peloton’s technology. That includes stationary bikes, treadmills, rowers, and ellipticals sold under the NordicTrack, ProForm, and FreeMotion brands. In particular, Peloton called out the NordicTrack S22i Studio Cycle Bike (which, to be fair, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; pretty similar to the Bike Plus). As for Echelon, it called out the company’s connected bikes, rowers, and treadmills — all of which offer similar features but for significantly less. During the pandemic, Echelons wares were often referred to as “Peloton alternatives” by &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-peloton-alternatives"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/health/features/echelon-review-cheaper-spin-bike-good-peloton"&gt;consumer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/i-tried-echelons-1000-alternative-to-the-peloton-bike-heres-what-happened/"&gt;tech sites&lt;/a&gt;. Echelon also claimed to have developed a $500 Prime Bike for Amazon, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452145/amazon-prime-bike-500-disavow-echelon-fitness-peleton-competitor"&gt;Amazon later denied the partnership&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddR562"&gt;As for what Peloton ultimately wants, the company is asking for a court order that would prevent iFit and Echelon from infringing on its patents, as well as compensation. If granted, that could have a massive impact on the connected fitness space. Most, if not all, modern connected fitness hardware involves some form of on-demand classes and leaderboards. Similar gadgets, like Mirror, Tonal, the SoulCycle Bike, Hydrow, and dozens of other lesser-known brands have popped up in Peloton’s wake. Meanwhile, Apple launched its own Peloton competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
