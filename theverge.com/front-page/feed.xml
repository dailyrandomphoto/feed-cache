    <title>This Microsoft Flight Simulator mod features the cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obO0yn"&gt;The massive cargo ship Ever Given has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/28/world/suez-canal-stuck-ship"&gt;stuck for nearly a week in the Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;, captivating the internet and frustrating the teams responsible for dislodging it and the governments hardest hit by the shutdown of the maritime trade route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZzE3Y"&gt;The ship (and its trademark “Evergreen” lettering painted on the side) has become so iconic, in fact, that its become a destination within &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, at least for one virtual pilot who appears to have created a mod that places the grounded vessel within the virtual Earth of the game,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/cargo-ship-stuck-suez-canal-shows-microsoft-flight-simulator-fly/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRyt7i"&gt;Twitter user Mat Velloso shared a video from TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@donut_enforcement/video/6944600483172551942?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowSX0XeT49TfTRlIDWRxg3g6t2lg9Zihh9bHS2F0VG10uco6J7WK%2F%2FocE%2F4Ec141fbGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAoH-du_eBDSCPaOby3Ck_T66ABwJ_VscOKDlIeoJLquR5Ror5ty0YSOXNXMEQv34Z&amp;amp;share_item_id=6944600483172551942&amp;amp;share_link_id=7B412BF6-71E3-4D43-9C86-E068D390C32B&amp;amp;timestamp=1616955896&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=d639892k2h9402&amp;amp;user_id=6687206843449132038&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;source=h5_m"&gt;originally captured and uploaded by user “donut_enforcement,”&lt;/a&gt; showing off the the flyby of the cargo ship to a convincing-sounding pilot narration as the boat sits stuck between the banks of the canal. The scene looks shockingly realistic, which is a testament to the quality of the mod and also just the demanding visuals of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J5atmB"&gt;Of course, there’s nothing stopping developer Asobo from updating the game with newer satellite imagery to include the ship for all players — there’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/satellite-images-of-ship-ever-given-in-suez-canal-shows-work-underway.html"&gt;plenty of such photographs&lt;/a&gt; having been taken over the last six days. But considering the game sources its imagery from Bing Maps and doesn’t always refresh in a timely manner, that means your game won’t have the Ever Given in it unless you’re able to mod it like in the video above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRJ2Va"&gt;There is currently &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-africa-middle-east-suez-canal-d73d015ffde50c3ddcffe4549e97d6ca"&gt;no concrete timeline for freeing the ship&lt;/a&gt; from its unfortunately angled predicament, so it’s certainly possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Stowaway, Made for Love, The Suicide Squad, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RzePeb3jJ960IZDtHBPmhjrFyk=/262x0:1287x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69039079/stowaway.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_apvQkWsVY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCSxEu"&gt;I had to take a break from streaming &lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt; because I’m about halfway through season 3 and I don’t want it to end (also it’s just too intense for a binge watch, let’s be real). But I just watched the first episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331604/netflix-the-irregulars-sherlock-holmes-watson"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irregulars&lt;/em&gt; — loosely based on the Baker Street Irregulars from the Sherlock Holmes books&lt;/a&gt;— and so far it’s really good, especially if you are like me and appreciate seeing an established story retold from the point of view of another character (or in this case characters). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9x0pb"&gt;A good batch of trailers this week, with that James Gunn movie everyone’s talking about and a Netflix flick about a group of astronauts headed to Mars who — surprise!— have an extra person aboard their ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGDyEN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nr9Z7b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From the horribly beautiful mind of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@JamesGunn&lt;/a&gt;. Watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheSuicideSquad?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheSuicideSquad&lt;/a&gt; full trailer online now. In theaters and streaming on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; August 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Available on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; in the US only, for 31 days, at no extra cost to subscribers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/6wQNTtwDN8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6wQNTtwDN8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HBO Max (@hbomax) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1375477644431478786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="C2wIcc"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MJfbLo"&gt;Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Viola Davis, and Sylvester Stallone (seriously the cast is huge) star in &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1EbSXxrZ34&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures"&gt;The trailer is age-restricted&lt;/a&gt; (and the blank screen looked weird as an embed, which was why I went with a tweet of the video above instead) since the movie is rated R, so you’ll have to watch on YouTube after you verify you are old enough to watch a violent super villain movie trailer with a Steely Dan song playing in the background (which got the very old &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/suicide-squad-trailer-steely-dan-dirty-work-1234939275/"&gt;song trending&lt;/a&gt;). The much-ballyhooed, heavily anticipated &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters and HBO Max on August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h13oa5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_apvQkWsVY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lNONxG"&gt;Stowaway &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qS3dhZ"&gt;The three-person crew of a spaceship headed to Mars discovers an engineer unexpectedly (and unintentionally) has joined them. That’s problem one. Problem two: the ship’s life support system has been badly damaged and there’s only enough oxygen for three people. Dilemma! Anna Kendrick, Daniel Dae Kim, Toni Collette, and Shamier Anderson star in this space thriller (a bona fide genre now) that hits Netflix April 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ccO988"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvWgNSLIULw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EAuO9G"&gt;Made for Love&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LnPSQ2"&gt;This adaptation of Alissa Nutting’s novel tells the story of Hazel Green, whose controlling, creepy tech billionaire husband implanted a chip in her brain that lets him track her movements, feelings, and thoughts. Yes, I too shuddered to think how not-unlikely this scenario may be soon enough. Cristen Milioti stars as Hazel, and Billy Magnussen is husband Bryan, and (I guess for some comic levity?) Ray Romano plays Hazel’s father. &lt;em&gt;Made for Love&lt;/em&gt; premieres April 1st on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6YJK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pNObLJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gs-ODufnJ8Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iu17gS"&gt;The Nevers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CKp6PI"&gt;This is the first full trailer of the HBO Max series about a group of women in Victoria-era England who suddenly have unexpected super powers. If you’ve heard of it but aren’t sure why, it may be the off-screen problems with creator Joss Whedon.  He stepped away from the project six episodes in citing exhaustion (however, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/justice-league-ray-fisher-next-superhero-star-joss-whedon-snyder-2021-3"&gt;accusations of “abusive” behavior&lt;/a&gt; from actor Ray Fisher on the set of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;, several actresses from &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; have since come forward saying &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/charisma-carpenter-joss-whedon-buffy-angel-accusations/"&gt;Whedon created a toxic work environment&lt;/a&gt; on that show). HBO opted to move forward with at least the first six episodes under a new showrunner and executive producer. &lt;em&gt;The Nevers&lt;/em&gt; will debut April 11th on HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the Amazon union vote is bigger than Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XiHO3k5C0le4-T2aqU-ykg4U8tk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69038843/acastro_210208_4402_amazonVote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFX64V"&gt;For the last seven weeks, workers at an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, have been voting by mail on whether to unionize. Their ballots are due on Monday, March 29th, and counting will begin the next day. If the union wins, the warehouse employees would become the first members of Amazon’s US workforce to unionize, a momentous event at a company that has long aggressively resisted labor organizing, and one that could be a first step toward improving conditions at the country’s second-largest employer. Here is what’s happened so far and what might happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cMp3TD"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IaElX3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s voting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2vTQQ"&gt;The vote is taking place at an Amazon warehouse called BHM1 in Bessemer, Alabama, outside Birmingham. It opened recently, beginning operations last March, but by the summer workers had grown frustrated enough with conditions there that they reached out to the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, which had a presence at nearby poultry plants and other businesses. By November organizers had gathered sufficient signatures to petition the National Labor Relations Board for an election, which is being held by mail due to the pandemic. In total, nearly 6,000 workers are eligible to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LddPJN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whhVMJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are they unionizing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LqhUEt"&gt;Employees say Amazon’s demanding and automatically enforced productivity metrics make work grueling, stressful, and dehumanizing. Amazon tracks two metrics: the average rate at which workers perform a task, called “takt time,” and how much time they spend not scanning items, called “time off task.” If workers fail to maintain a fast pace, they get reprimanded or fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCbHWB"&gt;“It’s hard to do, especially when you have a lot of big products coming,” said Perry Connelly, a worker at BHM1 who supports the union. “It got to the point where people started complaining about going to the bathroom and coming back and something being said to them about their takt time going up.” This is a common complaint among workers at BHM1 and other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;Amazon facilities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NXnI3"&gt;In an emailed statement, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said that “like most companies, we have performance expectations for every Amazonian – be it a corporate employee or fulfillment center associate, and we measure actual performance against those expectations.” Knox said performance is “measured and evaluated over a long period of time” and that “we support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve.” Knox also said that workers “are allowed to grab a snack, water, or use the toilet whenever needed” but did not directly address workers’ complaints that they are penalized for doing so.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBAZ7H"&gt;Connelly and other workers hope a union can improve working conditions and create a process around dismissals that feels less arbitrary. “I just want the people to get treated with respect,” Darryl Richardson, one of the employees to initially reach out to the RWDSU previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7RdzT5"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “I just want the people to get treated with respect”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4aqQse"&gt;Workers also hope a union can negotiate higher pay. Many of the workers are acutely aware that Amazon has done stupendously well during the pandemic, with profits up 84 percent in 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2021/03/16/the-amazon-union-battle-in-bessemer-is-about-dignity-racial-justice-and-the-future-of-the-american-worker/"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ personal wealth&lt;/a&gt; rising by about $70 billion. Meanwhile, many BHM1 workers like Connelly have seen their wages drop: BHM1 opened in March, when Amazon had implemented $2 per hour in additional hazard pay, a program the company ended in June, dropping their pay to $15.30 an hour. “A lot of people are talking about the fact that he received billions of dollars in the pandemic from all his facilities, but he didn’t kick none of that money back to his employees who were actually working and in the trenches for him,” said Connelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2RGf5L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He didn’t kick none of that money back to his employees who were actually working and in the trenches for him”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HfFgDo"&gt;If the pandemic sharpened employees’ grievances, the Black Lives Matter protests last summer following the killing of George Floyd helped galvanize many to act. The majority of workers at BHM1 are Black, and many participated in the protests around Birmingham. The RWDSU has also &lt;a href="https://bamazonunion.org/why-rwdsu"&gt;framed the campaign&lt;/a&gt; as a matter of civil rights and racial justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btWldv"&gt;“A lot of the employees at Amazon are Black, and a lot are tired of being treated any kind of way, talked to any kind of way, and being treated like they’re less than anyone else,” said Connelly. “With Black Lives Matter coming in, it’s showing that you have a voice now — let’s do something with it. Right now, the union is another entity of that voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sah8m7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F2YbZN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this a big deal? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="By7rTb"&gt;Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the US, with 800,000 employees, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;fiercely resisted&lt;/a&gt; attempts at worker organizing. The only other unionization effort to make it to a vote was in &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-union/amazon-com-workers-reject-unionization-in-delaware-vote-idUKBREA0E1MM20140116"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, with a small group of repair technicians in Delaware, and it failed after an aggressive anti-union campaign. More recently, the NLRB found that Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-nlrb/u-s-labor-board-claims-amazon-illegally-fired-warehouse-worker-idUSKBN28R319"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; workers who &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; the company’s handling of COVID-19. While the Bessemer effort would only organize a single warehouse, it would show that it can be done. Already, employees at other Amazon facilities have expressed interest in following in BHM1’s footsteps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJG8sv"&gt;“There’s a basic principle of organizing work that success breeds success, and that organizing often happens in self-reinforcing cycles of victory,” said Benjamin Sachs, a professor at Harvard Law School. “Organizing requires workers taking a risk, and the workers are more likely to take a risk when they see that the risk is going to pay off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vx2MSI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Success breeds success”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lgaEKF"&gt;Such a chain reaction could do more than change the conditions that hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees work under. Because of its size and the sprawling geographic scope of its logistics network, the quality and pay of Amazon’s jobs have a powerful effect on the quality and pay of other jobs. Amazon itself has been touting this effect &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gj87/why-amazon-is-flooding-the-country-with-dollar15-minimum-wage-ads"&gt;in its ads&lt;/a&gt; lobbying for a $15 minimum wage, and indeed, a &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3793677"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that when Amazon raised its starting wage to $15 an hour in 2018, wages at nearby employers also rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ko95sx"&gt;But when Amazon jobs are compared to &lt;em&gt;similar types of work&lt;/em&gt;, they come off much worse. Logistics jobs were historically a path to the middle class, and unionized warehouses typically pay double what Amazon does. When Amazon opens a warehouse, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/amazon-amzn-job-pay-rate-leaves-some-warehouse-employees-homeless?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; analysis&lt;/a&gt; found, wages at other nearby warehouses often drop. Amazon’s methods for worker tracking and enforcing productivity — aspects of the job that prompted BHM1 to unionize — have also spread across the logistics industry and other sectors as companies attempt to compete with Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DI6wzt"&gt;Sachs calls Amazon a bellwether employer, for its outsize role in shaping the labor market and defining the future of work, similar to the role the auto industry played in the early 20th century. “The unionization of that industry, which had a lot to do with labor law reform, was a defining moment for the labor market for decades,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxdhaL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UaKp2w"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What’s been Amazon’s response this time?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wYblfC"&gt;Amazon has been waging an aggressive campaign against the union effort, sending workers multiple texts a day urging them to vote no. It ran Facebook ads directing to a website that warned workers they would have to pay union dues (Alabama is a right-to-work state, and an &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/business/2021/02/amazon-accused-of-anti-union-activities-through-website.html"&gt;NLRB complaint&lt;/a&gt; has been filed regarding the website.) Management put up banners on the walls and signs on the restroom stall doors with messages like “Where will your dues go?” and “Unions can’t, we can!” The company has brought in a high-priced &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/10/amazon-alabama-union-busting-koch/"&gt;union-busting firm&lt;/a&gt; and held mandatory meetings at the warehouse. “They call them training sessions, but all it was was union bashing,” said Connelly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Otywk"&gt;Knox, the Amazon spokesperson, defended the company’s response to the union effort. “It is important that all employees understand the facts of joining a union and the election process,” Knox wrote. “We hosted regular information sessions for all employees, which included an opportunity for employees to ask questions, and educated through other channels as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xxull"&gt;The company has also employed more unorthodox measures. After losing its fight to have the election held in-person, Amazon sent employees mailers with instructions on filling out their ballot with a “no” vote and messaged them to deposit their ballots in a new &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3anw9k/amazon-sends-vote-no-instructions-to-unionizing-employees-tells-them-to-use-new-mailbox"&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt; installed at the warehouse entrance, &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reported. (Knox said “the mailbox was installed by the USPS and an option for convenient mailing to and from work but never a mandate.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kDGWEZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They call them training sessions, but all it was was union bashing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxAFr9"&gt;Employers have extreme structural advantages over organizers under US labor law, like their ability to hold mandatory anti-union presentations on company time while restricting non-work conversations and barring non-employee organizers from the workplace. Consequently, organizers are often left to canvass employees on nearby streets and sidewalks — or, in the case of BHM1, the parking lot as departing employees waited for the light to change. Then, late last year, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;asked the county&lt;/a&gt; to change the timing on the traffic light. Knox said this was done to reduce congestion during shift changes, but organizers say it made their work harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py0VWg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CAL0Aj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do things look? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0dLtpE"&gt;It’s been a hard fought campaign on both sides. Organizers expect the vote to be close, though Connelly is optimistic. More than 3,000 workers had signed cards expressing interest in a union in the runup to the election, an organizer previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, more than enough to win if they all voted yes. However, given Amazon’s high rate of turnover, many of the workers who signed cards may no longer work there, and others may have been convinced by Amazon’s anti-union blitz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vl4oQw"&gt;In recent weeks, the union has been buoyed by a series of outside supporters, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/01/biden-amazon-union-video-472315"&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt;, who released a video message on Twitter last month alluding to the campaign. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and activist and rapper Killer Mike visited the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-visits-bessemer-to-cheer-on-amazon-workers-union-effort/"&gt;warehouse on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, the latest in a string of &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-amazon-labor/no-sense-of-job-security-amazon-union-organizers-tell-lawmakers-in-alabama-idUSKBN2AX19K"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/business/2021/02/actor-danny-glover-comes-to-bessemer-to-show-support-for-amazon-union-push.html"&gt;celebrity&lt;/a&gt; delegations to Bessemer. The high-profile support has changed some minds, Connelly said, but the lengthy voting period means that some had already sent in ballots and had to request new ones to change their votes. “I think it’s a big swing around in the last month and a half,” Connelly said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsMmVk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TaEtAd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens next? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2K2j3u"&gt;Ballots have to be received by the National Labor Relations Board regional office by the end of the business day on Monday, March 29th. Counting will begin Tuesday morning but it may be several days before we know the result as the NLRB adjudicates any challenges and objections brought by either side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGiiMw"&gt;If the union wins, its fight won’t be over. Companies often stonewall in negotiations over a first contract, requiring further public and political pressure from the union. “There are so many examples of where unions win elections, and eventually they walk away because they cannot get the company to bargain in good faith and to get to a first contract,” said Janice Fine, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EKyZr"&gt;If the union loses, attention will turn to seeds of activism the Bessemer campaign has sown across Amazon’s network. The fact that the workers at BHM1 have made it this far, Fine said, is already a victory, given the way US labor law and Amazon’s power puts organizers at a disadvantage. Getting to an election is a signal to unions that it can be worth the energy and expense of attempting to organize Amazon workers, and to workers that the risks they take might pay off. There are already signs that workers are taking that lesson from Bessemer. Since the campaign began, the RWDSU said it has already been contacted by over &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/amazon-workers-inspired-by-alabama-weigh-union-drives-elsewhere?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;1,000 Amazon workers&lt;/a&gt; interested in unionizing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A top Twitch streamer has been live for nearly two weeks straight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lCmmoX2vBAWqfdBrLsdiNX92-c=/108x0:1553x963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69038701/ludwig.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ludwig on stream during his weeks-long subathon. | Image: Ludwig&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LBZePt"&gt;On Friday, the Twitch streamer Ludwig slept in. He got up around 11AM PT and lay in bed, chatting with the more than 30,000 viewers of his stream. He’s spent a lot of time in that spot lately — in fact, he’s broadcast dozens of hours of himself curled up in a bright red race car bed since his stream first started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oll8Gc"&gt;As of this morning, Sunday, March 28th, Ludwig’s stream &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig"&gt;has now been live&lt;/a&gt; for nearly two weeks straight. His stream started around 2PM PT on Sunday, March 14th, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/style/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-livestream.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to stream 20 seconds for every new subscription purchased to his channel (subscriptions are $5 per month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4iTaUM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=961089748&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ra4hKX"&gt;It’s a bit like a telethon — he won’t stop so long as the money kept coming in. “We’re making this like a goddamn vending machine,” Ludwig said just a few hours into the first day of his stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzcSph"&gt;The stream has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338680/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-subathon"&gt;turned into an event for Twitch viewers&lt;/a&gt;. Ludwig was already a star on Twitch when the stream began (the unofficial site TwitchTracker ranks him as &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/ludwig"&gt;the 11th most popular&lt;/a&gt; English-language channel), and as the days have gone on, he’s become the most subscribed to streamer on the site. Twitch has promoted the stream prominently on its front page and even wished the streamer goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3e8Up"&gt;As he neared the two-week milestone on Saturday, Ludwig had to step away from the stream for the day and invited friends to take over. To make sure the marathon stream didn’t end while he was out, he ran a subscription promotion to run up the timer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9arytz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Goodnight, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LudwigAhgren&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1371732150714703875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9Vkrn"&gt;“Subathons” have been happening on Twitch for years, and some have even extended for days in the past. In April, the streamer LosPollosTV &lt;a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/twitch-streamer-lospollostv-sets-new-world-record-for-longest-livestream-1349629/"&gt;went for more than six days&lt;/a&gt;, setting what was believed to be a live streaming record at the time. (Other streams have gone for longer since, but without running subathons the entire time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2M3tA"&gt;As his stream showed no sign of stopping, Ludwig has added some constraints. Subscriptions now add only 10 seconds to the clock. Viewers are limited to purchasing 100 gift subscriptions each. He’s also set a 31 day cap before he’ll sign off no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzN4ws"&gt;It’s not clear if he’ll reach that point. Over the course of this week, subscriptions have been slowing. There were 37 hours left on the clock as of 8AM ET Wednesday morning, but only 22 hours left as of 8AM ET Friday morning. As of this publication, the timer has been hovering just above and then periodically below 12 hours for some time — with subs still coming in to keep the clock relatively static throughout Saturday night and into Sunday morning —  and now sits at roughly 11.5 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cozy Grove is like Animal Crossing, if it was haunted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XJKklIfiMRMdSCeg_riamLLdOzs=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69038717/Cozy_Grove_5.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SjSR5q"&gt;One of the things that makes &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; so special is it’s soothing. There aren’t a lot of other games like it; it’s laid-back and comforting in a way that most games aren’t. Sometimes it can feel less like a game and more like a relaxing space to hang out in. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-one-year-anniversary-nintendo-switch"&gt;now that &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; has been out for more than a year&lt;/a&gt;, you may be looking for something just a little different. &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; might be just the thing: it has much of what makes &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;so great but in a tighter package. Also, there are lots of ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H2sW2"&gt;Much like &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; drops you on a seemingly uninhabited island with the goal of turning it into a bustling town. The difference is that in &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove,&lt;/em&gt; the island &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be inhabited. And it still kind of is. When you first arrive, it’s mostly devoid of color and life. But eventually, you’ll meet a few ghosts, and as you help them out, life will slowly return. You’re helped out by a sentient campfire — reminiscent of Calcifer from &lt;em&gt;Howl’s Moving Castle&lt;/em&gt; — who constantly wants to eat something called spirit wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TDIFsd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uK7En100og0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSG2my"&gt;What you actually do in the game is very similar to &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. You can catch fish, gather fruit, collect seashells, and craft new tools and items to decorate your campsite. There are no time limits or penalties for failure. But &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; is a bit more structured. The ghosts, which are all adorable animals, will ask for very specific things, like finding some lost earmuffs or catching fish for dinner. You can do a handful of these tasks each day, which will earn you some spirit wood; feed enough to your fire, and the island will grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAEqeP"&gt;It’s a good system for those who need that extra bit of structure, and &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; also does something unexpected: it encourages you to log off. There are only a handful of quests each day, and they’ll probably take you less than 30 minutes to complete. After that you’re free to do what you want — fish, decorate, craft — but the game makes it clear that you can’t progress any further until the next day. It’s always nice when a game is respectful of your time. Just like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; has turned into a habit for me, a nice space to dip into for a brief period each day. It helps that its hand-drawn world is incredibly charming. There’s even some hilarious writing and lore to dig into if you really want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FlFui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; is available now through Apple Arcade, and I’ve found it to be a perfect fit for mobile. Once I get a notification that new quests are available, I hop into the game for 20 minutes, and then I’m done. It might be the most peaceful part of my day. For those who don’t subscribe to Apple’s gaming service, &lt;em&gt;Cozy Grove&lt;/em&gt; is also coming to the Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC on April 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 review: a ThinkPad with a twist</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A business laptop with an extreme screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U50owR"&gt;The ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 is a ThinkPad through and through. It’s got the keyboard nub, the discrete mouse buttons, and the all-black chassis with scattered dots of red. (If you’ve seen its predecessor, the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2, you’ll know what you’re getting — the models are identical, with different chips.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OMES8"&gt;But this ThinkPad has a unique feature you don’t see every day: an OLED screen. That, combined with its discrete GPU, puts the X1 Extreme Gen 3 out of the business laptop space that ThinkPads traditionally dominate and into the crowded market for ultraportable content-creation machines. Among those competitors, the X1 Extreme has some significant drawbacks that keep it from reaching the top of the pack. But it still includes the features that have made ThinkPads so dominant across the board, and that means there’s certainly an audience for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngyRwq"&gt;Like other ThinkPads, the X1 Extreme is customizable for a variety of price points. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-3%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1E3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22351156%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;All configurations&lt;/a&gt; have an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q. The base model is $2,734 (currently discounted to a much more reasonable $1,640) and includes a Core i5-10400H, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 1920 x 1080 non-touch display, and a standard 720p HD webcam. Among prebuilt models, you can go all the way up to a system with a Core i9-10885H, 64GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, a 3840 x 2160 OLED touchscreen, and an IR camera, all for — wait for it — $4,959 (currently listed at $2,974.40). My test configuration is in the middle; it includes a Core i7-10850H, 1TB of storage, 32GB of RAM, and the OLED touchscreen. It has an MSRP of $4,111 but is currently listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-3%2Fp%2F20TKCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22351156%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,466&lt;/a&gt;. You can tweak most of the specs to your liking, though some are dependent on others; for example, all models that don’t have the base display come with the IR camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LheQl6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10412807"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHbX8Z"&gt;This model has two absolutely standout features. The first is the keyboard. ThinkPads usually have great keyboards, and this one is no exception. It’s one of my favorite keyboards that I’ve tried on a workstation laptop this year, with the possible exception of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;. The keys have a comfortable texture and a heck of a lot of travel, without being too loud. The typing experience feels closer to that of a mechanical keyboard than to that of flatter laptop keys. I actually found myself eschewing my personal laptop during my testing period in favor of the ThinkPad because of how much I love typing on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y87H04"&gt;There’s a row of useful hotkeys on the top of the deck. New to the X1 Extreme are three buttons tailored to remote work: F9 brings up the notification center, F10 answers calls, and F11 ends calls. There are also keys to cut the volume and microphone, toggle airplane mode, and adjust volume and brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnYjjQjbDSScsYPLd8SrV8Qz0mU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395210/mchin_20190614_4484_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports include two USB 3.2 Gen 1, two Thunderbolt 3, one HDMI 2.0, one SD slot, one combo audio jack, and an optional Nano-SIM card slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBqHDr"&gt;One quick thing about the keyboard: the Fn and Ctrl keys are swapped from the locations where you’ll find them on most keyboards. This is how ThinkPad keyboards have been laid out since forever, and you can remap the keys through the BIOS or with Lenovo’s utility app if you prefer. But if you’re not a regular ThinkPad user, or you’ll be swapping between this machine and a personal laptop, it’s worth noting that it’ll take time to adjust (or you’ll be using mislabeled keys). I’ve been using the X1 Extreme for almost a week, and I’m still accidentally hitting Fn all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFD8dq"&gt;The second standout feature is the 15.6-inch 4K OLED panel. It covers 100 percent of the sRGB spectrum, 100 percent of Adobe RGB, and 100 percent of P3. (Basically, it maxed out our colorimeter.) The panel is sharp and vibrant with great contrast. You can watch streaming content that supports HDR and swap between various color profiles with Lenovo’s Display Optimizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcSXVr"&gt;Build quality is another strength. Like most of its ThinkPad siblings, the X1 Extreme feels quite durable. There’s no flex in the keyboard or lid, and Lenovo says it’s been tested against “12 military-grade certification methods and over 20 procedures” for resistance to vibrations, shocks, extreme temperatures, humidity, and the like. The laptop achieves this without sacrificing much portability. It’s on the thick side at 0.74 inches — but at four pounds, it’s lighter than many competitors including the Dell XPS 15 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 angled slightly to the right, open. The screen displays an outdoor nighttime scene with the Lenovo logo on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXDIGoXf3RedDTim02P3NoPSc-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395211/mchin_20190614_4484_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo says the multi-layered carbon fiber top cover “provides durability and weight advantages.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q088LS"&gt;The chassis has a black finish with a nice texture. The ThinkPad logo on the right palm rest and the X1 logo on the top cover add splashes of red. The lid has a unique carbon-fiber weave pattern, which looks and feels similar to the carbon-fiber palm rests on the Dell XPS 15. (This is only available on UHD models). Lenovo says this material is lighter and more durable than aluminum and other common chassis materials. It’s also likely part of the reason for the X1 Extreme’s lofty price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 angled to the left, open. The screen displays a nighttime outdoor scene with the Lenovo logo on the right side. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X0ZNpB3vWvxdThLDkc1CarEjAms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395209/mchin_20190614_4484_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are dual far-field microphones that work alongside Cortana.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GGfdae"&gt;One note on the build: the lid and chassis aren’t the worst fingerprint magnets I’ve ever seen, but they do pick them up. After a few days of use, the keyboard deck was pretty smudgy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhrsPp"&gt;Finally, the X1 Extreme comes with some helpful features for remote meetings. You can optimize the dual microphones for various settings (including voice recognition, solo calls, and conference calls) in Lenovo’s Vantage software. They didn’t have any trouble picking up my voice. And the stereo speakers are fine, delivering distortion-free audio with percussion and bass that are audible but not exceptional. You can create custom equalizer profiles in the preloaded Dolby Access software, and you can also toggle presets for scenarios like voice, music, movies, and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="c7YyMZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10412819"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fNB0Nw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The webcam was fairly color-accurate and delivered a decent picture in low-light environments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="acOAQg"&gt;The infrared webcam was also a pleasant surprise — while a bit grainy, it was fairly color-accurate and delivered a decent picture in low-light environments. There’s a physical privacy shutter that’s easy to click back and forth. You can sign into the X1 Extreme with Windows Hello facial recognition, as well as a match-on-sensor fingerprint reader on the side of the keyboard deck, which was quick to set up and didn’t usually have trouble recognizing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nveSkm"&gt;All of this stuff is similar to the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2 — there’s not much noticeable change. The Gen 3’s upgrades are on the inside. It has a six-core 10th Gen Intel processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q, where &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-2"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt; had a 9th Gen Intel processor and a GeForce GTX 1650 Max-Q. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrilqe"&gt;The Core i7-10850H isn’t the most monstrous processor around, especially compared to AMD’s recent H-series chips. But it does bring the business-specific benefits of Intel’s vPro platform, and it did a fine job with my piles of spreadsheets, emails, Slacking, and other general office work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YC0QAi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10412821"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ofgkp8"&gt;Similarly, the GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q is a midrange graphics card — it’s not what you’d want to use for serious gaming or high-throughput professional video editing. But for amateur creators and other artists, it can certainly lend a hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moEAAO"&gt;My test model scored a 386 on PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which tests its proficiency in real-world Premiere Pro tasks. That’s not a shameful score among top competitors, but it’s not great either. The system comes in under scores we’ve seen from the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=26551"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with the same GPU, and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=20668"&gt;six-core MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which has AMD Radeon Pro 5300M. And, of course, it loses out to creator machines with more powerful Nvidia chips, such as the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16834233375%3FDescription%3Dgigabyte%2520aero%252015%26cm_re%3Dgigabyte_aero%252015-_-34-233-375-_-Product" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower-priced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=29079"&gt;Gigabyte Aero 15&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 3060. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkGqvq"&gt;If you’re going to be doing intense content work, prepare to hear the fans. Even when I was just bouncing around in Chrome, they were audible quite often. On the plus side, they did their job: the laptop’s bottom, keyboard, touchpad, palm rests, and hinge all remained cold. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard and touchpad of the Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Va21heQbbg0100Dy8EB4qAzP0Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395213/mchin_20190614_4484_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo says the ThinkPad can charge up to 80 percent in 60 minutes with its “Rapid Charge” feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk4JEd"&gt;Another compromise you’re making here is battery life. I only averaged four hours and 59 minutes on our battery test, which involved using the ThinkPad for continuous office multitasking on the Battery Saver profile, with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. I ran a trial without using Chrome to see if that would make a difference; it didn’t. And this result actually seems to be a bit on the high side — &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; got an even pithier two hours and 19 minutes on a synthetic streaming benchmark.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlJKr7"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a machine with a 4K screen and a discrete GPU wouldn’t last all day. But I got more juice out of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255234/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Gigabyte Aero 15&lt;/a&gt;, which has both an OLED display and a heftier graphics card. And if you don’t need the high-resolution screen (which many people won’t), the Dell XPS 15 (which still has an exceptional display) lasted an hour longer with my workflow, while my colleague Dieter Bohn got up to eight hours out of the MacBook Pro. Folks who are interested in the X1 Extreme who would prefer not to have it plugged in all the time should consider an FHD (1080p) model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 open on an outdoor rock slab. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with the Lenovo logo on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IBMZiohOMt3SrXSbbzv2H3OqB5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395208/mchin_20190614_4484_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a ThinkPad through and through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DoCsu4"&gt;Ultimately, the decision between the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 and other 15-inch thin-and-light workstations really boils down to: do you want a ThinkPad? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdHcWN"&gt;This is to say that the X1 Extreme shares many of the strengths and weaknesses of Windows machines like the XPS 15. Both have dazzling displays, decent chips, sturdy build, boisterous fans, and mediocre battery life. Both have best-in-class keyboards and touchpads, with average webcams and speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkE3dd"&gt;But a ThinkPad and an XPS are still very different machines — and if you’ve used any member of either lineup before, you probably know which one you prefer. They have different looks and different feels. The ThinkPad is slightly lighter and slightly thicker, with more ports and larger bezels. The XPS is a bit more powerful, but the ThinkPad has extra business features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Jzszel"&gt;The XPS, due to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-15-touch-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9500-laptop%2Fxn9500cto212s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22351156%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower price&lt;/a&gt;, is a more accessible model for most consumers. And the X1 Extreme’s weaker chips and poor battery life, in particular, are tough pills to swallow at such a high price. But there’s still a market for the X1 Extreme — and if you’re willing to sacrifice a bit of power, a bit of money, and a bit of battery life for the unique advantages of a ThinkPad, you probably fall into it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comic-Con will hold an in-person event in San Diego over Thanksgiving weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="San Diego Comic Con" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPcMUKR9s45obNw9VjdHMlCUSjQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69038322/IMG_4309.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8W1k0x"&gt;Comic-Con won’t be hosting its regular in-person annual gathering this summer, as the organization behind the cosplay and fan gathering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;cancel the event for the second year in a row&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is now an in-person event on the books for the fall to compliment the limited online versions the organization is hosting in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya5Fny"&gt;Comic-Con International, the non-profit in charge of running the event and its companion conventions, &lt;a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci"&gt;announced on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to hold a three-day, in-person event in November. It will take place in San Diego, where Comic-Con typically holds its biggest annual summer event at the city’s convention center. Yet it’s not known right now what the size or scope of the event will be. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/comic-con-hold-person-thanksgiving-convention-n1262265"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC N&lt;/em&gt;ews reports&lt;/a&gt; the dates will be November 26th to November 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yERgMx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Comic-Con will have its first in-person event since the start of COVID-19 this November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3WxUs"&gt;“As the timing and scope of our larger event factored greatly into our decision to postpone, we believe that launching a smaller in-person event at a later time may be a safe alternative. For this reason, we are happy to announce that San Diego Comic Convention is planning to present a three-day in-person convention in San Diego in November,” reads the press release. “At this time, we are still working on specific details as to attendance capacity, badge cost, and related information, and those details will be forthcoming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9blKy"&gt;Comic-Con is among the US’s largest conventions, drawing more than 130,000 people to San Diego and generating hundreds of millions in revenue for the city on top of the tens of millions of dollars it generates for the organization itself. The organization says that if you purchased a ticket to Comic-Con 2020, your rolled over 2021 ticket is valid for the next in-person event in 2022. However, the organization is “working on an option for those wishing to transfer their badge or exhibitor deposits/payments as full or partial payment towards our 2021 November event,” reads the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbHBRu"&gt;Although it has maintained its roots as a cosplay and fan gathering, Comic-Con in recent years has provided a vital marketing function to Hollywood film and TV studios, comic publishers, production companies, and other arms of the entertainment industry. Celebrities often use the show to promote new and ongoing projects and studios use the visibility of the con and the exclusivity of being live in the audience to reveal new trailers and other teases that only later get uploaded to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon faces lawsuit over missed lunch breaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXWXrzWpFUyGrm0tJpCss4BHoeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69036607/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9BNCQ"&gt;A lawsuit that claims one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers in California failed to provide required meal breaks for employees has moved to federal court, as attorneys seek class-action status. First filed in San Francisco County Superior Court in February, the case was removed to US District Court California, Northern District on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGd8pF"&gt;Lovenia Scott, a former employee of the Vacaville, California warehouse, alleges that the company didn’t schedule the required 30-minute meal breaks for workers. When they did get their meal breaks, workers were expected to monitor their walkie-talkies in case of any problems on the floor, which sometimes cut into their break time, the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqBO3K"&gt;The matter of paying workers for time they spend waiting for employers while off the clock has come up in other cases as well. The &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-workers-fairpay-20141209-story.html"&gt;Supreme Court decided in 2014&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon workers at a Nevada warehouse weren’t entitled to pay for the time they spent waiting to have their bags searched after clocking out but before leaving the building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyK120"&gt;Earlier this month in a separate case, Amazon and an independent contractor it worked with in California were&lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/california-fines-delivery-service-and-amazon-6-4m-for-wage-theft"&gt; fined $6.4 million for wage theft&lt;/a&gt; by the California Labor Commission’s Office. The state investigation in that case found that Green Messengers, the subcontractor for Amazon, underpaid drivers, scheduling them 10-hour days but with a workload that forced drivers to skip meal and rest breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSbXBk"&gt;Due to the way the meal breaks were organized in Vacaville, Scott claims, many workers took their breaks at the same time. Lines would form at the computer system where employees swiped their badges to clock out for their break time, meaning those at the end of the line saw their breaks shortened as they waited their turn. Scott’s lawsuit also says shifts were “chronically understaffed,” which left some employees unable to take short 10-minute rest breaks in order to finish their work on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJzLJm"&gt;In addition, workers were not compensated for using their personal cell phones to perform work tasks, the lawsuit claims. Scott, who worked at the Vacaville warehouse from October 2016 to January 2019, also says Amazon failed to timely pay her final wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZoqTk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;Amazon has been bickering with US senators&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter the past few days via its @AmazonNews account, questioning— among other things— the accuracy of reports that some of its delivery drivers are so overworked that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;had to pee in bottles&lt;/a&gt; because they didn’t have time to take restroom breaks. Numerous &lt;a href="https://revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/"&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;support this claim&lt;/a&gt;, however. And Monday is the deadline for workers at Amazon’s plant in Bessemer, Alabama to vote whether to form the first-ever Amazon union in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAoONs"&gt;Amazon did not reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeep plans to install EV charging stations at US off-road trailheads over the next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BbdaD_-lBTK_z8Lv9vrk6QH02ok=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69036020/CN021_007JP9oc73s45m5h4169n1pcevs2dm9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stellantis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oikkM3"&gt;Jeep will install EV charging stations at off-road trailheads across the US as part of a partnership with Electrify America, the company &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jeep-brand-creates-jeep-4xe-charging-network-works-with-electrify-america-to-provide-ev-charging-at-off-road-trailheads-throughout-the-united-states-301256830.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. Chargers on the Jeep 4xe Charging Network will either be solar powered or connected to a power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E51tRv"&gt;The first of the stations will open this spring in Moab, Utah; the Rubicon Trail in Pollock Pines, California; and Big Bear, California. The chargers will have Level 2 (240 volt) charging, which Jeep notes will fully recharge the 17-kWh battery pack in its Wrangler 4xe in about two hours and provide 49 MPGe and 21 miles of electric range. The chargers will be available free to Jeep 4xe owners via a mobile app, and will be compatible with its future EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krRWdH"&gt;Over the next year, additional chargers will be added at Jeep Badge of Honor off-road trails across the US. The announcement comes a few days after Jeep unveiled its concept for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344578/jeep-wrangler-magneto-concept-ev-manual-transmission-stellantis"&gt;all-electric Wrangler, called the Magneto&lt;/a&gt;. Its design is based on the 2020 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, with an electric motor offering up to 273 pound-feet of torque and 285 horsepower, with an 800-volt system spread across four battery packs, &lt;a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22607&amp;amp;mid=1"&gt;according to Jeep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN0zsp"&gt;Rivian, the Amazon-backed electric vehicle startup, said last week it plans to install 10,000 fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341664/rivian-install-10000-ev-chargers-us-canada-2023"&gt;EV chargers across the US&lt;/a&gt; and Canada by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aT0Gn"&gt;Hulu’s Android TV apps can finally stream in 1080p on new Nvidia Shield TV set-top-boxes and Sony Bravia TVs, as spotted by users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShieldAndroidTV/comments/mcadwb/heads_up_the_hulu_app_has_finally_been_updated_to/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and written up by &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hulus-android-tv-app-finally-bumps-up-to-1080p-from-720-1846562065"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv-hulu-now-supports-1080p-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/25/hulu-android-tv-720p-limit-shield-tv-upgrade/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hApVfk"&gt;Users first noticed the change in the “App &amp;amp; Device Info” page in the Hulu app. After updating, the app lists the new max video resolution as “1920 x 1080”. It’s sort of a sneaky way to make the change. Looking at the update description on the Play Store, there’s no mention of it, so it’s possible something changed on Hulu’s server side as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hulu’s App &amp;amp; Device Info screen that shows the new max resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dvcnOI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; says it was able to confirm that at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;the Nvidia Shield from 2019&lt;/a&gt; and Bravia TVs received the 1080p bump on March 23rd, but the change hasn’t been reflected in &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality?language=en_US#svod"&gt;Hulu’s support pages&lt;/a&gt;, which were last updated in February. Hulu doesn’t seem to specifically list which devices stream in each resolution (outside of Live TV streaming) on its support site, but it does provide minimum bitrates for each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eNHqEC"&gt;Standard Definition (SD): 1.5 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0q1wNY"&gt;High Definition (HD) 720p: 3 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="szWWv7"&gt;High Definition (HD) 1080p: 6 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OOePMJ"&gt;4K Ultra HD: 16 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xxBhAg"&gt;For the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;, which runs a skinned version of Android TV, it’s not clear when 1080p Hulu support was added, or if it launched with it. I was able to check on my own Chromecast’s Hulu app and it does currently support 1080p. We’ve reached out to Hulu to confirm which other Android TV devices might have been affected by this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUMnVl"&gt;4K streaming is even more limited on Hulu. 4K content is primarily limited to Hulu’s original shows and movies, and according to Hulu’s likely out-of-date list, the devices that can actually stream in 4K are the 5th generation Apple TV, the Chromecast Ultra, Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, LG UHD TVs from 2017 onwards, Roku devices, Vizio TVs with SmartCast, and the Xbox One S and X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8M3nbR"&gt;It’s nice that more devices could theoretically stream in a higher resolution, especially for folks who’ve shelled out money for higher resolution displays. I do think it’s worth mentioning, however, that some of the Redditors who first found this change had no idea they’d been streaming in 720p all this time. &lt;/p&gt;
