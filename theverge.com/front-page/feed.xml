    <title>Taco Bell had beef with Beyond Meat’s fake carne asada</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2hUjQZ"&gt;Taco Bell, the restaurant known for having ground beef that's utterly indescribable, reportedly told Beyond Meat that its version of carne asada wasn’t good enough to serve. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/taco-bell-abandoned-plan-to-test-beyond-meat-s-carne-asada?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chain canceled a test product that featured Beyond’s plant-based steak after samples failed to live up to its standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiMfHU"&gt;Beyond Meat denies the report — Shira Zackai, head of communications at the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that “the test between Beyond Meat and Taco Bell was not canceled. Our partnership is strong, and we are actively working together to create a plant-based protein that’s completely new to the national QSR (quick serve restaurant) space. We look forward to sharing more details on what Beyond Meat and Taco Bell have planned in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx3q8s"&gt;The report doesn’t make it clear what the company wasn’t fond of — was it the texture? The taste? Was it just too high-end for Taco Bell, seeming more like something you’d find at a Chipotle rather than the restaurant known as the place you drunkenly get 2 AM takeout and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319868/taco-bell-nfts-gif-tacos-sell"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;? Whatever the case, people on Twitter have been having an absolute field day with the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="pTEtco"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That's a bummer but also wouldn't be that big of a deal if they actually subbed out the meat for black beans with 100% accuracy when I ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My good Taco Bell is at about 85% and my bad one is at about 50%. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NUO1IWUvoQ"&gt;https://t.co/NUO1IWUvoQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ring My Bell (@RingMyBellPod) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RingMyBellPod/status/1469067305300598787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cShyL2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the two companies are still planning on working together to add plant-based meat to the menu, promising that it’d be something “entirely new.” Taco Bell is also testing out its own plant-based protein similar to its ground beef at some restaurants, &lt;a href="https://thebeet.com/taco-bell-is-testing-vegan-meat-at-nearly-100-us-locations/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Beet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/review-taco-bell-new-plant-based-meat-cravetarian-2021-4"&gt;one writer from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described it as “very disappointing”) . Beyond Meat did, however, reportedly let go of two employees who worked on the carne asada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0OQRX"&gt;A few other restaurants are currently trialing Beyond Meat products — the most notable is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728805/mcdonalds-mcplant-beyond-meat-burger-test"&gt;the McPlant from McDonalds&lt;/a&gt;, but Panda Express and KFC are also working on chicken-like products with Beyond as well. While some may read Taco Bell’s trial cancelation as bad news for vegetarians, the chain already sells the perfect meatless fast-food dish: the spicy potato taco, which makes up a far larger percentage of my diet than I’d care to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhcnH1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 20th, 9:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Beyond Meat denying &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;em&gt;’s report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sen. Warren and AOC demand answers from Amazon after warehouse deaths</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roof Collapse At Amazon Facility Following Deadly Tornadoes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8EjehmIZruleslw5UorqUqA3l7s=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296648/1237190049.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Six people were killed when an Amazon warehouse in Illinois was struck by a tornado&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9HN3w"&gt;A group of progressive Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Reps. Cori Bush and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is demanding answers from Amazon after six people were killed in a tornado strike at one of its warehouses in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRpyq"&gt;A letter sent Monday to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos says the events that happened on December 10th at the Edwardsville facility “fit a larger pattern: Amazon puts worker safety at risk in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dO9Ugc"&gt;“As we work to ensure that tragedies such as this one are not repeated, we seek answers about what happened at your Edwardsville warehouse,” the letter continues, “and whether your policies may have contributed to this tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3C2iO"&gt;The tornado was part of a complex of extreme weather centered in western Kentucky on December 10th, leaving at least 58 dead over more than 150 miles. The path of destruction included Amazon’s fulfillment center in Edwardsville, which was entirely destroyed by the strike. In the aftermath of the building collapse, reports emerged that workers at the warehouse didn’t receive proper safety training, and an overall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"&gt;lack of preparedness by Amazon&lt;/a&gt; left workers in harm’s way, despite weather warnings that tornadoes were likely that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCrXQ8"&gt;Warren said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the circumstances in Edwardsville served as “another reminder that Amazon’s anti-worker and anti-union practices put their workers directly in harm’s way. Putting corporate profits above the health and safety of workers is unacceptable.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDUndC"&gt;In addition to Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), the letter is also signed by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Ed Markey (D-MA) and Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Jesus Garcia (D-IL), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Mondaire Jones (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jerry McNerny (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), Paul D. Tonko (D-NY), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), and Andy Levin (D-MI). It takes issue with a long list of problems at Amazon facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DO2MG5"&gt;The letter includes a list of questions for Amazon to answer by January 3rd. In particular, the lawmakers ask who was working at the Edwardsville warehouse on December 10th and what safety policies Amazon had in place, as well as whether Amazon required workers at the plant to remain at work despite the tornado warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSxRvl"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841667/amazon-delivery-driver-illinois-tornado-warehouse-destruction"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that a nearby driver was instructed to continue deliveries just 90 minutes before the tornado strike, being told by their dispatcher that the storm sirens were “just a warning.” Amazon is investigating the incident and has said that the dispatcher “should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QCk8hn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon warehouse policies put workers at risk","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22836393/amazon-warehouse-tornado-collapse-illinois-disaster"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LbYNR6"&gt;The lawmakers also write they are “deeply concerned” about reports that Amazon plans to reinstate its mobile phone ban, which it paused in 2020 because of COVID. However, Amazon spokesperson Alisa Carroll told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week that the company had updated its cell phone policy. “All reporting that it’s been rolled back to pre-COVID is simply not true and factually incorrect,” Carroll said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBN8it"&gt;Two of the people killed in the Edwardsville warehouse collapse were constituents of Rep. Bush, who represents a district in St. Louis. She said in a statement that “Amazon’s profits should never come at the cost of our community’s lives, health, and safety. This cannot become the cost of doing business in America.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How scientists decided what the most powerful space telescope ever will look at first</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEes6m2Zoe5ybbede1KCRdlDExQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296679/acastro_211217_4938_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Picking what the James Webb Space Telescope will do in its first year of life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VwXW2C"&gt;In late March, Grant Tremblay was sitting at his computer at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, listening in on a Zoom meeting, when he saw a string of emails pop up in his inbox. The title of each email read: “Cycle 1 JWST Notification Letter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oxNi6"&gt;He knew immediately that this was the day he and his colleagues in the astronomy community had been eagerly awaiting: it was Blacker Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUJSB6"&gt;Blacker Friday, to be clear, didn’t have anything to do with discounts, or Fridays. (It was a Tuesday.) It was the day that Tremblay, an astrophysicist at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and other astronomers around the world, would learn if they would receive a small amount of time to use the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, one of the most powerful space telescopes ever created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kgiKny"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to answer fundamental questions that cannot be answered any other way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mcZXvw"&gt;Blacker Friday is named after Brett Blacker, who co-runs the science policies group at the Space Telescope Science Institute, or STScI. Each year, the institute is responsible for selecting which astronomers will get time to use NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. And each year, after a lengthy decision-making process, Blacker would send out a flurry of emails to hopeful astronomers, all on the same day at the same time, informing them if their proposals to use the telescope had been accepted or rejected. Thus, Blacker Friday — also sometimes known as the Blacker Apocalypse — was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGCyi5"&gt;This year the stakes were even higher on Blacker Friday because, for the first time ever, astronomers were being informed if they would get time with JWST, a brand-new space observatory that is significantly larger and more powerful than Hubble. Set to launch to deep space at the end of December, the nearly $10 billion NASA-built telescope promises the ability to peer into the recesses of the Universe like never before. Ahead of JWST’s launch, STScI had the daunting task of figuring out which of the 1,173 proposals for the observatory’s first year of life — known as Cycle 1 — should get time with the telescope. How do you prioritize what the most advanced piece of space equipment in the world should do when it first turns on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7wDss"&gt;Well, the science has to be nothing short of revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJ4XJB"&gt;“What is deemed most interesting is science that is considered transformational — that will change our view of the universe,” Klaus Pontoppidan, an astronomer and JWST project scientist at STScI, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We don’t want the observatory to do things a little better than what has been done before. We wanted to answer fundamental questions that cannot be answered any other way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xLoMYk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of JWST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IsLFtu"&gt;NASA plans to launch JWST the day before Christmas. But for the astronomy community, the launch is the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; holiday. JWST is one of the most anticipated space science missions of the 21st century, as it has the ability to reshape astronomy and astrophysics as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oACDt9"&gt;That’s because the telescope is the closest thing we have to a time machine. Sporting a 21-foot-wide gold-plated mirror, JWST will be able to see in the infrared with incredible sensitivity. It’ll be able to see objects that are 10 to 100 times fainter than what the Hubble Space Telescope can see, and it’ll be capable of seeing things in 10 times better detail. It will gather light from stars and galaxies located up to 13.6 billion light-years away — light that has taken 13.6 billion years to reach the telescope’s mirrors. Since the Universe is thought to be roughly 13.8 billion years old, the galaxies that JWST will be observing likely formed just 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang. Our Universe was in its infancy then, and JWST will be providing us with the baby photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ua0sAD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nearly every area of astronomy that you can think of will be addressed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv9qov"&gt;In addition to peering back in time, the telescope will help us understand the large-scale structure of the Universe, and perhaps tell us if it will go on expanding forever. It will peer into the centers of galaxies, finding supermassive black holes and helping astronomers learn how these enigmatic objects have evolved over time. It will observe the births and deaths of stars. It will even look back at our own Solar System to study the faintest objects at the edge of our cosmic neighborhood. And it will be able to look at the edges of worlds orbiting around distant stars. “Nearly every area of astronomy that you can think of will be addressed,” Christine Chen, an associate astronomer at STScI, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJoUwoJjZT_8Dyyrv9j6nAP8bN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23109657/51412123217_ba966ac1c2_o.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of JWST completely unfurled in space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IVyi6p"&gt;The promise of JWST has always been just over the horizon. Since an iteration of the telescope was first conceived in 1989, the road to the launchpad has been paved with cost overruns and technical issues. Naively, NASA originally envisioned a launch &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-224.pdf"&gt;between 2007 and 2011&lt;/a&gt;, for a total cost between $1 billion and $3.5 billion. But JWST continued to miss one target launch date after next, &lt;a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/cost-of-the-jwst"&gt;while its total cost ballooned to $9.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyPLcz"&gt;As everyone waited for JWST to materialize, the world of astronomy blossomed. An entirely new field has emerged since the 1990s, one that revolves around the study of planets outside our Solar System, or exoplanets. Since the &lt;a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/historic-timeline/#first-planetary-disk-observed"&gt;first detection of an exoplanet was confirmed in 1992&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve discovered thousands of these far-off worlds orbiting alien stars. In 2017, astronomers shocked the world when they announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/22/14674088/7-planet-solar-system-discovered-conditions-for-life-water-nature-nasa"&gt;the discovery of an entire alien solar system&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of seven planets roughly the size of Earth all orbiting around a dwarf star. And three of the seven planets, known as the TRAPPIST-1 system, sit in the star’s habitable zone, where temperatures are thought to be just right so that water can pool on a planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzorTn"&gt;After discovering such a bounty of exoplanets, astronomers are now eager to find what is referred to as Earth 2.0: a planet that’s the size of our world, orbiting a star like our Sun at the right distance for liquid water to form. But exoplanets are incredibly faint, and traditional methods for detecting them — like watching stars dim ever so slightly as planets pass in front of them — can’t tell us what might be lurking on their surfaces. JWST, however, is powerful enough that it may be able to detect light passing directly through the atmospheres of some alien worlds and use that light to say what kinds of chemicals are present in the atmosphere. Perhaps, it could even detect signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NBJOqv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All of our transformational leaps in observational astronomy are enabled by making ever larger pieces of glass.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jKLch1"&gt;It’s a capability no one really envisioned when JWST was first being designed, but now it’s considered one of the more exciting areas of science that the telescope will touch upon. It also means there are even more people who are very eager to get just a few hours with the most advanced space telescope over built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4d6jv"&gt;“All of our transformational leaps in observational astronomy are enabled by making ever larger pieces of glass, right?” says Tremblay. “And when you make a damn piece of glass that’s large enough — and especially when you launch it into space — the discovery space for that observatory grows with time. It doesn’t diminish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6JJTyc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing the Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5yVfy"&gt;While JWST is ultimately a NASA mission, it’s the Space Telescope Science Institute’s job to determine what JWST actually &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;in space. “You can think of us as sort of the software part of the observatory,” Pontoppidan says, “whereas NASA is the hardware part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCDLXs"&gt;However, STScI had to wait a long time before figuring out the schedule for JWST’s first year, and there were a few false starts along the way. When it seemed like the telescope would be ready to launch in 2019, the Institute called on astronomers to submit their proposals by March 2018. Then just a week before the deadline, NASA announced that the telescope wouldn’t launch until 2020 at the earliest. STScI abruptly postponed the deadline until a more concrete launch date was determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1AHa1"&gt;Another postponement came again in March 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, astronomers turned in their proposals by November 24th, 2020, two days before Thanksgiving. Then it was time for STScI to sift through the more than 1,000 ideas that had been submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86Rc6F"&gt;STScI knew that it couldn’t handle this process alone. The Institute created a Time Allocation Committee including astronomers and astrophysicists from around the world. They were separated into 18 panels, each one consisting of about 10 people tasked with looking over proposals for different areas of space science and ranking them based on three important criteria: how much the proposal will impact knowledge within a subfield, how much it will advance astronomy in general, and whether the proposed idea requires the unique capabilities of JWST to be successful. Given just how many people want to use JWST, the Institute didn’t want to allot time to an observation that could be done with any of the other telescopes currently online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Blk2KZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We regret to inform you...” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCHgDW"&gt;With all of these benchmarks in mind, the committee got to work evaluating all of the proposals. To try to eliminate as much bias as possible from the selection process, the process was “dual anonymous.” That means that the people writing the proposals had no idea who would be evaluating them, and the people on the committee had no idea whose proposals they were analyzing. As a result, 30 percent of the winning proposals are helmed by women, and scientists studying for their PhDs also saw more success in getting their ideas approved. “Now since nobody knows who wrote the proposal, students can be just as successful as their mentors,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIeBSU"&gt;After roughly four months of painstaking debate, the committee selected the proposals it found to be the most transformative. It then gave each proposal a certain number of hours of observation time. Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news/jwst/2021/stsci-announces-the-jwst-cycle-1-general-observer-program#:~:text=The%20Cycle%201%20GO%20program,broad%2C%20worldwide%20community%20of%20observers."&gt;STScI selected a total of 266 proposals&lt;/a&gt;, submitted by scientists from 41 countries around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfbXX3"&gt;Tremblay, the Harvard astrophysicist, had submitted nine proposals for JWST’s first year. On Blacker Friday, nine new emails sat in his inbox. (The emails don’t come from Blacker anymore but from the Science Mission Office at STScI). He quickly clicked through them and read one after the next:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sPhyZ"&gt;“Dear Dr. Tremblay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fes324"&gt;We regret to inform you...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WyKQ1i"&gt;He read the phrase nine times in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYSVZ0"&gt;It was a disappointment but definitely not a shock. “I wasn’t broken up by not getting time this year,” Tremblay tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I knew it would be immensely, immensely competitive for Cycle 1, as it should be. And it’s okay. We’ll resubmit again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kauov3"&gt;Nearly 2,000 miles away, Caitlin Casey, an astronomer at the University of Texas, was having a very different kind of Blacker Friday. She was at home in Austin, holding her sleeping two-month-old baby in her lap, while scrolling her phone. That’s when she saw the email pop up in her inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Lxrq"&gt;“Dear Dr. Casey,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz85kM"&gt;We are pleased to inform you...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrSGk1"&gt;The ambitious project she had proposed, called Cosmos Webb, had just been approved. And the Institute was giving Casey a whopping 208 hours with JWST to fulfill her project, the most of anyone who had submitted proposals. The project will stare at a particularly large patch of sky the size of three full Moons, an area that spans up to 63 million light years across. Doing so will create a portrait of the young universe similar to the Hubble’s iconic Hubble Deep Field, which showcased some of the earliest galaxies we could observe at the time. With JWST’s enhanced capability, the team will be imaging galaxies that are even older at even greater levels of detail. “If the Hubble Deep Field were printed on an eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper, Cosmos Webb would be like a 16-foot by 16-foot mural on the side of a building,” says Casey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="02Q5rg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All I had to say was, ‘We got it.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OxiSui"&gt;Staying silent so as not to wake her sleeping child, Casey jubilantly logged into Slack and messaged her colleague on the project, Jeyhan Kartaltepe, an astrophysicist at the Rochester Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgFKFv"&gt;“All I had to say was, ‘We got it,’” Casey tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “She was dumbfounded, too. And I think for the rest of that day, both her and I, we could not even [focus]. It was a flurry of excitement and just overwhelmed with that news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzDtpeFO5N5Dt1xzG1j4FEmenCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114556/2981_PIA22093_NASA.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic illustration of what the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system could look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxMaJQ"&gt;Aside from Cosmos Webb, the seven-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will be getting a lot of attention during JWST’s first year, with up to seven different programs dedicated to studying this strange cluster of worlds. JWST will be looking in the atmospheres of these planets, as well as dozens more we’ve found throughout the Universe, hoping to determine if these places might be suitable for life as we know it. And there are hundreds more targets that JWST will observe, including galaxies, quasars, black holes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87foMl"&gt;While the committee tried to be as logical as possible with their final decisions, everyone agrees that serendipity does come into play. “Probably there were a lot of amazing programs similar to ours that were also up for consideration,” says Casey. “There’s always a little element of luck in the final selection process. Maybe someone on the panel just liked the specific way we presented some information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zgyYgI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NkyztC"&gt;Roughly 10,000 hours of observing time is allotted to different groups for JWST’s first year of life. About 6,000 hours were given to the scientists who submitted proposals around the world, while nearly 4,000 hours were already set aside for scientists who helped design and build JWST and its instruments. The STScI also has about 460 hours of discretionary time which have been allotted for what is known as “Early Release Observations.” Data from these hours, scheduled to be done in the first five months of science, will become public immediately, so that anyone — even those who did not get time with the telescope — can analyze the observations and write their own studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdmrrj"&gt;Anyone who does the math will realize that 10,000 hours is actually more than the number of hours in a calendar year. STScI purposefully overprescribed JWST’s time to account for any snafus. STScI will be scheduling JWST’s observations in two-week increments, during which time the observatory will point at its intended targets autonomously. However, it’s possible that JWST will fail to execute some commands properly from time to time. If that happens, JWST will simply go on to the next observation. And the Institute wants to make sure the telescope has fallback plans when such errors occur. “We don’t want to get to the end of the year, and then run out of observations,” Pontoppidan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t06tsCTbiHkEPGwXGsANicdycIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114561/52682_1536x1024.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope folded up ahead of encapsulation on top of its rocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPiBGM"&gt;STScI is also planning to carve out time for targets we don’t know about yet. These are events like the explosive destruction of a star, known as a supernova, or when two particularly dense stars come together in a cataclysmic merger, known as a kilonova. If astronomers spot a particularly juicy supernova occurring in the sky, JWST’s operators are prepared to reorient the schedule so that they can quickly observe the aftermath of the eruptive event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgB7KU"&gt;The prioritization of JWST’s observations will be determined by the time of the year, and where things are positioned in the sky. But as for the very first observation the telescope will do, NASA knows what it is — but won’t tell. It’s supposed to be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DcfL5"&gt;While flexibility is going to be key for JWST Cycle 1, STScI guarantees that all the proposals that have been approved &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; occur. Because each target in the sky is in JWST’s view twice a year, if for some reason a target is missed, there is a second opportunity to observe it six months later. If a target isn’t observed in the first year, it might simply bleed over into next year. “Basically, everything that gets through the committee — recommended and approved — will execute on the telescope,” Chen says, “as long as the telescope, you know, works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGur2"&gt;If everything goes well with the telescope’s launch, NASA plans to conduct at least five and a half years of science with it, and hopefully up to 10 years. Ultimately, the observatory’s lifetime is dictated by its limited fuel reserves, which are needed to help reorient JWST in space. Whenever that fuel runs out, JWST’s mission will end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MQiebM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the community has immense demand for the telescope. And I think it’s a great thing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3MWcA"&gt;That finality is still quite a ways off. First, JWST must launch and actually survive its trip through space. Once it reaches its final home 1 million miles from Earth, JWST will undergo six months of commissioning — when scientists meticulously test out the instruments on board — before the real science begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAh6Wn"&gt;And then, after a period of transformational science has passed, it’ll be time to submit another round of proposals. Though Tremblay will be involved with one JWST proposal for Cycle 1 as a collaborator rather than the principal investigator, he does plan to submit his ideas again for Cycle 2. And he’ll understand if it doesn’t get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RTu0r"&gt;“As an astronomer we get professionally used to rejections; I could wallpaper my hallway with rejections that I’ve received,” Tremblay says. “It’s just a reflection of the fact that the community has immense demand for the telescope. And I think it’s a great thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5w40dL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CT05Ui"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says he’ll pay over $11 billion in taxes this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TIME Person of the Year" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fV9UuHMaD1KBqyrD495_95xI9Is=/0x0:3648x2432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296341/1358939085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time Person of the Year 2021, Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Theo Wargo/Getty Images for TIME&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rs8zWG"&gt;Elon Musk expects to pay over $11 billion in taxes in 2021, the Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1472754632325795843"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The figure is roughly in line with &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/12/15/elon-musk-to-pay-record-high-12-billion-tax-bill.html"&gt;a report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt; last week, when it estimated that Musk has already paid $7 billion in state and federal taxes this year, and will pay a further $5 billion by January 1st. CNBC said the figures could represent “the single largest tax bill ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHGaiJ"&gt;The disclosure comes as Musk and other billionaires are facing increasing scrutiny over the amount of tax they pay. As &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/20/elon-musk-says-he-will-pay-over-11-billion-in-taxes-this-year.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, Musk doesn’t take a salary or cash bonus in his role as Tesla CEO, and instead is compensated in stock awards. When he needs money, he’s able to borrow it using his stock holdings as collateral, which doesn’t carry the same tax obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91GukE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For those wondering, I will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1472754632325795843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G5NBCj"&gt;The big difference this year is that in early November Musk started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775485/elon-musk-twitter-poll-tesla-stock-option-sold-taxes"&gt;selling off billions worth of Tesla shares&lt;/a&gt;, which involves paying a combined tax rate of over 53 percent &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/12/15/elon-musk-to-pay-record-high-12-billion-tax-bill.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was ostensibly the result of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088"&gt;Twitter poll conducted in November&lt;/a&gt;, in which users voted for Musk to sell off 10 percent of his Tesla stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBHlcd"&gt;But observers have noted that Musk would have had to pay a large tax bill on stock options expiring next year regardless. And by choosing to exercise the stock options now rather than waiting until August 2022, Musk might avoid higher tax rates introduced under Democrat’s Build Back Better bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8eD0v"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Musk paid zero federal income tax in 2018, and only paid $455 million in taxes in the previous four years despite his wealth growing by $13.9 billion. Speaking at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698563/elon-musk-code-conference-liveblog"&gt;this year’s Code Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said his taxes were zero in 2018 because he overpaid the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40bsCc"&gt;While Musk appears to be making good on his claim that he’ll pay “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470898920146542592"&gt;more taxes than any American in history&lt;/a&gt;” in 2021, this shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given that he’s reported to be the world’s richest person by quite some margin. Musk’s net wealth is currently estimated to sit at around $243 billion, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt;, almost $50 billion more than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with a reported $195 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s ‘first gaming laptop’ has an RTX 3080 and 11th Gen Intel CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t1nmexUaylYsa2wJQh-7QgRHy7M=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296146/LG_UltraGear_Gaming_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The laptop features an RGB keyboard.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yDZdI"&gt;LG has announced what it’s calling its “first gaming laptop,” the UltraGear 17G90Q. The 17-inch laptop is powered by a combination of an 11th Gen Intel Tiger Lake H CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics card, and can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqCALl"&gt;The company is no stranger to making laptops, but the focus of its previous models has generally been on office productivity rather than offering a top-of-the-line gaming experience. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; we reviewed earlier this year, for example, was a great lightweight work machine, but its lack of a beefy dedicated GPU meant it definitely wasn’t a gaming machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSVdkI4A_ebFvDUBEhDztGUksgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23114486/LG_UltraGear_Gaming_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four ports are hidden on the rear of the machine, including HDMI and Ethernet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gG4K88"&gt;LG lists two laptops on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Flaptops&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F20%2F22846139%2Flg-ultragear-17g90q-rtx-3080-gpu-11th-gen-intel-cpu-storage-gaming-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its site&lt;/a&gt; equipped with Nvidia GPUs, but both have the lower-powered GTX 1650. In contrast, the RTX 3080 found inside the new UltraGear 17G90Q is the fastest GPU Nvidia currently offers for laptops. Other specs include a 1080p IPS display with a 300Hz refresh rate, a 93Wh battery, an RGB keyboard, a fingerprint sensor on the power button, and a 1080p webcam. Its casing is made from aluminum, and the laptop comes in a fetching purple gray color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wg0amL"&gt;Although the LG UltraGear 17G90Q is meant for gaming, it’s still equipped with a bevy of physical ports. There are two USB-C ports (including one USB 4), two USB-A ports, a headphone jack, HDMI port, Ethernet, and there’s even a microSD card slot for good measure. Charging is handled via a dedicated DC input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HEPOl"&gt;Pricing for the 17G90Q is yet to be announced, but LG says it’ll be announcing more details at CES on January 4th. It’ll be released first in the US and South Korea starting in  early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Brady’s best throw of the night destroys Microsoft tablet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TyTgnOcUxWut3Ckn3bV8IYgUYts=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70296124/brady_vs_microsoft_surface.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Brady rage quitting Microsoft Surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3Er4z"&gt;After throwing a fourth-quarter interception to seal a 9-0 loss against the Saints on Sunday night, Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady managed to connect with a Microsoft Surface tablet, absolutely destroying it. The defeat was &lt;a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-gets-shut-out-for-first-time-in-15-years-vs-saints-keeping-a-drew-brees-nfl-record-safe/"&gt;Brady’s first shutout in 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, according to CBS Sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehReaz"&gt;Brady joins an illustrious group of Surface abusers that include &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/8/9693380/the-packers-are-terrible-aaron-rodgers-surface"&gt;Aaron Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SN_Ohio/status/691374430728130560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;Johnny Manziel&lt;/a&gt;, and former boss Bill “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13320664/bill-belichick-patriots-microsoft-surface-tablet-nfl"&gt;I just can’t take it anymore”&lt;/a&gt; Belichick, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0kiYq"&gt;Surface tablets have suffered regular abuse since &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7359503/microsoft-surface-nfl-demo-hands-on"&gt;their introduction in the 2014 NFL season&lt;/a&gt; after Microsoft became the official provider of tablet-based image reviews for teams during games, replacing the black-and-white photographs that had been in use for decades. The tablets were frequently called “iPads” in early post-game interviews despite Microsoft paying millions to the NFL for the exclusive advertising and equipment rights. And early &lt;a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-surface-tablets-blamed-after-nfl-breakdown/"&gt;technical and usability issues&lt;/a&gt; often caused the Surface tablets to become high-speed projectiles in the hands of athletes prone to favoring human growth hormone injections over vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ABg3IK"&gt;A trove of leaked images shows what Garmin’s upcoming 2022 smartwatch lineup may look like. A report by German technology site &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127058.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the supposed images of the Garmin Fenix 7 series, Venu 2 Plus, Epix Gen2, and Instinct 2 series smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKZCtR"&gt;The post shows that the Fenix 7 series may consist of three models: the standard Fenix 7, 7S, and 7X, all of which are rumored to be made of both reinforced plastic and stainless steel. At least one model will carry over the built-in solar panel from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;the top-end Fenix 6&lt;/a&gt; that charges the device while you’re wearing it, while others will include the familiar tracking features. It appears that the base model will only come in black, while the Fenix 7S may have an all-white variation, as well as an option that has a rose gold frame with an off-white band. &lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t provide any additional details on the rumored 7X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bd4Hta"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Epix Gen2 trades a square watch face for one that’s round and comes with new health tracking features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hlx7zk"&gt;Also included in the post is the Epix Gen2. Garmin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7486787/garmin-fenix-3-epix-vivoactive-smartwatch-connect-iq-ces-2015"&gt;originally debuted the Epix smartwatch in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and unlike its predecessor, the leaked images show that the Epix Gen2 trades a square watch face for one that’s round. The Epix Gen2 looks to have built-in GPS like the original, along with features new to the Epix line of watches, including a blood oxygen sensor, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qMK14"&gt;Images of the Instinct 2 and 2S show that the watches may have retained the same rugged look that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/11/17965748/garmin-instinct-rugged-smartwatch-outdoors-pricing-feautures"&gt;the original Instinct had&lt;/a&gt; when it was first released in 2018. &lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt; claims the watches use an e-ink display that allows the device to conserve battery life, and also comes with features that track your heart rate, steps, and sleep. The white variation of the base Instinct smartwatch appears to have an integrated solar panel. However, it remains unclear what the differences are between the 2 and 2S, but it’s possible that the 2S is the smaller of the two. The same can be said for the Fenix 7 and 7S, considering that the previously-released Fenix 6S and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/30/15113006/garmin-fenix-5-5s-5x-review-fitness-tracking-multisport-watch"&gt;Fenix 5S models&lt;/a&gt; have smaller displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6O8u0G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Venu 2 Plus seems to have an additional third button that the standard model doesn’t have&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MwO6bk"&gt;Lastly, &lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt; shows us more of what appears to be the Venu 2 Plus. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1471655765769433089"&gt;Leaked images of this smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; have already been floating around the internet, and the images here only corroborate what the initial leak shows. The device is rumored to have both black and white variations, as well as come with an OLED display. It also seems to have an additional third button that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review"&gt;standard Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have, but it’s unclear what it may be for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yswDEZ"&gt;We may not have to wait much longer for Garmin to officially announce the lineup. With CES 2022 just weeks away, Garmin may make the big reveal at the event. For now, you can see all of the leaked images on &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,127058.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winfuture&lt;/em&gt;’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney and YouTube TV cut a deal to bring back ESPN, FX, and other channels</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1kaPt"&gt;Disney and YouTube TV have reached a deal today to put more than a dozen Disney-owned channels back on Google’s internet TV streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDgJod"&gt;The news follows a previous announcement late Friday that the two had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;failed to reach an agreement&lt;/a&gt; before their contract expired, and users were informed they would no longer have access to the channels, which included ESPN, Disney, FX, and other Disney-owned properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYw0eS"&gt;“We are pleased to announce that after a brief disruption, we have reached a new distribution agreement with Google’s YouTube TV for continued carriage of our portfolio of networks,” Disney said in a statement. “We appreciate Google’s collaboration to reach fair terms that are consistent with the market, and we’re thrilled that our robust lineup of live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming is in the process of being restored to YouTube TV subscribers across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmTw1a"&gt;With the loss of channels, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 to $49.99 per month. In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the reinstated service, YouTube TV said it would return to its original $64.99-per-month service cost, but that it will “honor a one-time credit for all impacted members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1vDaH"&gt;“For active members who have not yet received that $15 discount on their monthly bill, you will automatically receive a one-time credit on your next bill with no action needed,” YouTube TV said. “For members who were impacted and have initiated the cancellation process, we would love to welcome you back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng2o9T"&gt;YouTube TV said that it has started to restore access to the Disney-owned properties on its service, including local ABC stations, which will return “over the course of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC settles with Verizon, AT&amp;T, and others over failed 911 calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhte_qzeEtWYvLvv25Tl4r2cKPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294725/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UFV1c"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/four-companies-settle-fcc-investigations-compliance-911-rules"&gt;has reached settlements&lt;/a&gt; with AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Intrado, and CenturyLink (which now goes by Lumen Technologies) over investigations into failed 911 calls that occurred during network outages in 2020. The companies will pay a total of $6 million combined and also agreed to ensure compliance with the FCC’s 911 availability rules going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOACx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T will pay $460,000 to settle two different investigations regarding network outages that took place on September 28th, 2020. Both Lumen Technologies and Intrado agreed to resolve investigations into outages that occurred on that same day, with Lumen Technologies paying $3.8 million and Intrado paying $1.7 million. Verizon settled with the FCC over an investigation of an outage that took place on May 7th, 2020, paying $274,000 as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JjexEM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5TA3d"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, Lumen Technologies, and Intrado weren’t just probed for failed 911 calls. The FCC also reports that it opened an investigation as to whether these companies alerted the affected 911 call centers of the outages in a timely manner. It also investigated AT&amp;amp;T for potentially failing to “deliver number and location information” during the outage, which is in violation of FCC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKjhfJ"&gt;“Sunny day outages can be especially troubling because they occur when the public and 911 call centers least expect it,” said FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. “It’s vital that phone companies prevent these outages wherever possible and provide prompt and sufficient notification to 911 call centers when they do occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX28cX"&gt;Just last month, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaches-195m-settlement-t-mobile-911-outage-investigation"&gt;T-Mobile agreed to pay $19.5 million&lt;/a&gt; to settle an investigation into whether T-Mobile violated the FCC’s 911 calling rules during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292024/t-mobile-verizon-att-calls-failing-down-phone-networks-us-carriers"&gt;the massive nationwide outage&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok Kitchens will bring viral culinary creations to fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLF8kEIrV3imKfWjxaKT9QUj5SQ=/0x480:2991x2474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70294485/tiktok_kitchens_food_samples.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Virtual Dining Concepts/TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RT8mTk"&gt;TikTok is partnering with Virtual Dining Concepts (VDC) to launch TikTok Kitchens, a delivery-only service that will cook up some of the trendiest recipes on the app, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-17/tiktok-viral-food-recipes-like-feta-pasta-available-in-virtual-restaurant-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok and VDC will reportedly open around 300 locations across the US to start, but plan on expanding to around 1,000 by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky3LwD"&gt;TikTok Kitchens will operate out of existing restaurants, including chains owned by VDC co-founder Robert Earl, such as Buca di Beppo and Bertucci’s. It’s essentially a ghost kitchen service, but unlike some companies in this niche, VDC’s kitchens don’t appear to operate out of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807607/go-read-ghost-kitchens-uber-eats-doordash"&gt;satellite, trailer-converted kitchens in parking lots&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href="https://www.virtualdiningconcepts.com/concepts/tiktok-kitchen/"&gt;VDC’s description of the service&lt;/a&gt; notes, TikTok Kitchens will make use of a restaurant's existing kitchen and employees but will provide the training, food packaging, and TikTok-sourced recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JyfNXp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The menu will initially feature the viral baked feta pasta, corn ribs, pasta chips, and the smash burger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2x7qCE"&gt;To keep things fresh, the menu will rotate quarterly, given how fast viral content comes and goes on the platform. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says that the menu will initially feature the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/02/11/baked-feta-pasta-recipe-tiktok/"&gt;viral baked feta pasta&lt;/a&gt; — which was apparently the &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2021/US/"&gt;most-searched recipe on Google&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 — air-fried strips of corn known as &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2021/8/5/22611324/what-is-the-tik-tok-corn-ribs-trend-momofuku-ssam"&gt;corn ribs&lt;/a&gt;, the crispy, cheese-covered &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/07/16/pasta-chips-tiktok/"&gt;pasta chips&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the smash burger. The creators who inspired the recipes on the menu will receive part of the proceeds, as noted by the &lt;a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/news/virtual-dining-concepts-launches-tiktok-kitchen-brand"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opLpcU"&gt;“Creators will be receiving credit for dishes within the menu and will be featured prominently throughout [the] promotion,” said TikTok spokesperson Elena Saavedra in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To be clear, this is a campaign to bring TikTok foods to fans, not a venture into the restaurant business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yufBTX"&gt;VDC has already seen success with &lt;a href="https://mrbeastburger.com/"&gt;MrBeast Burger&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual kitchen that the ultra-popular YouTuber, MrBeast, first launched towards the end of 2020. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes that MrBeast sold one million burgers in just three months, and that there are now 1,500 kitchens throughout the US, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zk7cO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
