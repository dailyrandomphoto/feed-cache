    <title>Lightyear’s new trailer turns a cute toy into a sci-fi hero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwauFOwRe83ATlwa3ZhAQpO5zwM=/0x67:4096x2798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051391/LIGHTYEAR_ONLINE_USE_b030_38_pub.pub16.2145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PIXAR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stoxfp"&gt;Have you ever really wondered about Buzz Lightyear’s origin story? Not the action figure, which helped make &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; so beloved, but the actual space ranger? Well, Disney and Pixar sure are hoping so with the upcoming feature &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as “the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear” and the first trailer makes it look like a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-style sci-fi adventure, complete with cool spaceships and futuristic alien worlds. The movie even casts an action movie star, with Chris Evans handling Buzz’s voice. Angus MacLane, who co-directed &lt;em&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/em&gt;, is serving as director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxfJT2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; was actually first announced last year, but you’d be forgiven for forgetting about it: the reveal was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;a massive wave of more than 50 updates from Disney&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly marks a shift in tone for both Pixar and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Disney says the movie will be coming out on June 17th, 2022, though it’s not clear if it will be exclusive to theaters or available on Disney Plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI announces compact, modular, and magnetic Action 2 camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/071PhW5aKdiG-483cx9Uyb6t6t4=/399x23:1573x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051273/DJI_Action_2_KV___Studio_05__Front_touchscreen_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yPkdh6"&gt;DJI has announced a follow-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20751772/dji-osmo-action-camera-gopro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;its Osmo Action camera&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s got a completely new design — the Action 2 drops the Osmo name and focuses on modularity with a suite of additional parts and accessories that attach to the camera magnetically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv5eV7"&gt;The camera module itself is small (it's 39mm square and 22mm deep) and includes a 12MP sensor capable of 4K recording, a lens that provides a 155-degree field of view, and a 1.76-inch OLED touchscreen covered by Gorilla Glass. Using magnets, you can attach another touchscreen (which also boosts the battery life and adds an array of microphones), an extra battery, or a variety of mounts that let you attach it to tripods or GoPro mounts, or even wear the camera as a necklace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muAws1fM7O7lhhVH_TZ77UWUsCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954848/DJI_Action_2___Power_Module__back_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modules, like the one that adds extra battery power, attach with both magnets and physical clips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T8eDmf"&gt;Speaking of GoPro, any action cam is going to face comparisons, and the Action 2’s specs fall short when put side by side with those of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;the recent Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;: it can do 4K at 120 frames per second like the Hero10 but lacks any higher-resolution options (the Hero10 can do 5.3K60), and its 240fps super slow-motion runs at 1080p instead of the GoPro’s 2.7K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6bhzA"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that the Action 2 is &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; in comparison — it weighs just 53 grams, which is almost exactly a third the weight of the Hero10. DJI also includes 32GB of built-in storage (expandable with a microSD card), something the GoPro lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbzL8q"&gt;There’s also the system of magnetic accessories DJI is working on, which lets you customize your camera in a way that’s not really possible with the GoPro. If you need a second screen or more battery, you can just snap them on — and then take them off when you want a compact or discreet camera. Other accessories, like a headband or magnetic ball-mount adapter that can be attached to tripods, are similar to GoPro accessories but will (in theory) be easier to attach to and detach from the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhLIOxY8OyUT8qEVXVoasWo8dME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954849/DJI_Action_2___Camera_Unit___Front_Touchscreen_Module__back_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Action 2 has a touchscreen on the back, and the front screen module lets you add another one, as well as augmenting the camera’s single microphone with three others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQFXUf"&gt;The Action 2 also has action cam table-stakes features like electronic stabilization, horizon leveling, and the ability to livestream or be used as a webcam, as well as some neat tricks like a color temperature sensor that DJI says will help produce better colors in complicated lighting situations or underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilyFmF"&gt;Comparing the Action 2’s price with GoPro’s isn’t straightforward, due to GoPro’s pricing model and the DJI’s modularity. You can get the Hero10 for $400, but that requires having a $50-a-year subscription — otherwise, the camera is $500. The Action 2 power bundle costs $399 and includes the camera, power module (which extends your record time to 180 minutes versus the camera’s 70 and adds an extra microSD card slot), a mount, and a lanyard. DJI tells me you can’t buy the camera by itself, which seems like a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjFKBN"&gt;If you want to replicate the Hero10’s built-in front-facing screen, you’ll have to go for the $519 dual-screen bundle, which includes the same things as the power bundle (but swaps out the battery module with the screen one) and adds a ball-joint adapter as well. While that’s technically more than the GoPro’s non-subscriber asking price, the Hero10’s lack of built-in storage means that you’d probably make up the price difference buying a microSD card anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FH7JUD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="DJI Action Cam 2|104515" data-volume-uuid="77a6c6aa5" data-volume-id="104515" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-616" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ZquG"&gt;DJI says that the dual-screen bundle will be coming on November 2nd, and the power combo, along with most other accessories, will be coming in “mid-November.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is my Alexa flashing green, red, orange, and yellow?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Wr_Bs7JZBoIDYkC8N8yzcnu-KA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051319/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your Echo speaker is flashing, Alexa is either listening or trying to tell you something.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IBNLLC"&gt;You’ve got one of Amazon’s Echo smart speakers set up and it’s super handy for playing music, checking the weather, setting an egg timer — all hands-free. But then it starts flashing different colors at random times: red, green, yellow, orange... it’s almost like it’s trying to communicate with you. Which, in fact, it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQbVIZ"&gt;When your Echo speaker is flashing its LED at you, there is a really easy way to figure out what it wants. Just say, “Alexa, what does your light mean?” But that would be a really short blog. So, for those of us who don’t like talking to our smart speakers, I’ve made this quick cheat sheet to explain what all those flashing lights mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JQtIY"&gt;The LED light is Alexa’s status and notification indicator. Depending on which device you have, the LED light will be in a different location. For example, on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;new Echo&lt;/a&gt; and Echo Dot, it’s a ring at the bottom; on the Echo Studio, it’s a ring up top; and on the Echo Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;smart displays&lt;/a&gt;, it appears as a line on the bottom of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZxsu8"&gt;Wherever it’s situated, most of the time it’s hanging out doing nothing. But when you see it pulsing, circling, or swirling, Alexa is either listening to you or trying to tell you something. Here’s what it wants you to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nteD6p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEBJfP"&gt;A slow yellow “burst” every few seconds means your Alexa voice assistant has something to tell you. Ask, “Alexa, what are my notifications? Or “Alexa, what are my messages?” and all will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdmng"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing blue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wkBMKJ"&gt;A cyan spotlight on a blue ring means Alexa heard you — the cyan spotlight will actually point in the direction it heard your voice. It will then spin as it processes your request. If it’s spinning while you’re not talking to it, it means the device is starting up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vox4qKFfg95XIGT4cIJqbQl0ufo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989899/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cyan blue point on a blue light ring shows that the Echo smart speaker is listening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6DFHeT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZhNHc"&gt;If the ring is solid red, it means the speaker’s microphone is muted and can’t hear you. Hit the unmute button to open up those mics again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WL0zFQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JRDVn9"&gt;A swirling orange light means the Echo speaker is in setup mode or is trying to connect to the internet. An orange line on a smart display like an Echo Show means it’s trying to connect to the internet but is currently offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MkYzPP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nkt8he"&gt;Pulsing green on an Echo tells you someone is calling you. It should be accompanied by an announcement of who is calling. Say “Alexa, answer” to connect to the call (assuming you want to answer it). While on the call, the green light starts spinning until the call ends. A spinning green light will also appear if you are in a “Drop-In” with another speaker on your network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JmTtMVEQ180G8pHq0-CKbBwUEMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641649/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LED light bar on the Echo Show smart displays will appear at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CpSFa2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing purple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tTQs8w"&gt;A purple ring or line means you’ve got Do Not Disturb enabled on the speaker. This blocks notifications, calls, and messages, but not alarms, timers, or reminders. It will flash purple when you ask it to do something. You can ask Alexa to turn Do Not Disturb off or do it manually in the Alexa app. If it goes purple while you are setting up the device, it couldn’t connect to Wi-Fi during setup (as opposed to &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to connect, which is represented by orange).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSwnat"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing white&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WTirRF"&gt;A white light moving up or down (or around) indicates you’re adjusting the volume either on the device or in the app. A spinning white light means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622968/alexa-guard-amazon-echo-security-how-to-get"&gt;Alexa Guard&lt;/a&gt; is turned on and set in Away Mode. You can go to the app and change it to Home Mode or say, “Alexa, I’m home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lsyc5G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to stop Alexa from flashing (as much)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0AieF1"&gt;If the constant flashing is bothering you (which is quite likely if you’re using the device as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727055/alexa-google-smart-speaker-alarm-clocks-backup-battery"&gt;smart alarm clock by your bed&lt;/a&gt;), you can turn off all but essential notifications: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5hbd1m"&gt;Go to the Alexa app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wqhwB2"&gt;Tap on More &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Device Settings &amp;gt; [your speaker name] &amp;gt; Communications &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KI9CR2"&gt;Toggle Communications off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0HFmZE"&gt;This will only stop the yellow and green rings from flashing — which are also the most likely to flash. But it will also disable Drop In and Announcements (where you can speak to one Echo in your house and every other one will relay the message), and it will still flash if there’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft ramps up plans to make its data centers less thirsty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boiling liquid carries away heat generated by computer servers at a Microsoft datacenter. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PohV-1JZgasKHf2ZBpjA9Go9mas=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051260/datacenter_liquid_cooling_server_blade_immersion_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Boiling liquid carries away heat generated by computer servers at a Microsoft datacenter.  | Image: Gene Twedt for Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zh84m8"&gt;Microsoft ramped up its commitments today to conserve water and energy in its data centers, laying out new cooling tech and strategies that could push &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abfba1"&gt;notoriously thirsty and energy hungry&lt;/a&gt; servers past their current limits. The company’s latest environmental pledge comes as it plans to dramatically expand the number of data centers it operates around the world, a move that could put more stress on drought-stricken communities unless the company finds ways to use less water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VddZip"&gt;Microsoft plans to slash the amount of water its data centers use by 95 percent by 2024, with the goal of “eventually” eliminating water use. That builds on a commitment it made last year to become “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448896/microsoft-environmental-pledge-water-scarcity-data-centers"&gt;water positive&lt;/a&gt;” by the end of the decade, meaning it would replenish more water than it uses for its operations. In 2020, Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;committed to becoming carbon negative&lt;/a&gt; by the same deadline, meaning it plans to draw down and store more planet-heating CO2 than it releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="oLTB5U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plans to dramatically expand the number of data centers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJ7Z99"&gt;Microsoft also announced other &lt;a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/uncategorized/2021/10/14/5-reasons-to-attend-the-digital-event-whats-next-for-sustainability/"&gt;sustainability efforts&lt;/a&gt; today that could lower greenhouse gas emissions inside and outside the company. It’s looking for building materials for its data centers that are less carbon-intensive, including research into bricks made with algae and structural tubes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22257120/mushroom-bricks-mycelium-sustainable-building-materials"&gt;made with mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. It also previewed a new tool called Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, which can help organizations track their carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDmYTs"&gt;But the big commitment involves the data centers. Data centers like Microsoft’s are packed with servers which enable people to store files, send messages, and shop and game online. All of that activity uses up a lot of energy and generates heat. Overheating can affect servers’ performance and reliability, but blasting them with air conditioning drives up electricity use and greenhouse gas emissions. It’s possible to use water to cool down servers, but water has become an increasingly scarce resource in many of the arid places where data centers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaBuw7"&gt;A typical data center uses about as much water as a city with a population of about 30,000 to 40,000 people, or about 3 to 5 million gallons of water a day, says Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University. Microsoft tells&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its data centers use less water than that, although it varies across different regions and climates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PWWwz"&gt;Microsoft’s data centers currently use adiabatic cooling, which relies on outside air to cool down temperatures inside. It’s a system that uses less electricity than air conditioning and less water than cooling towers. But when temperatures rise above 85 degrees Celsius, outside air isn’t very helpful. At that point, an evaporative cooling system kicks in, which uses water. It works like a “swamp cooler” — cooling the air by pushing it over or through water-soaked screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJJoHN"&gt;Microsoft today revealed two main strategies it plans to lean on to meet its water conservation goals. First: it researched how its servers perform under higher temperatures, and found that it can set higher limits for when the centers’ evaporative cooling systems kick in. In cooler parts of the world — including Amsterdam, Dublin, Virginia, and Chicago — those higher set points could, over the next few years, get rid of the need for water completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j492pC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data centers in desert regions, where water scarcity is a bigger problem, will likely continue to guzzle water&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVJ1LW"&gt;But Microsoft’s data centers in desert regions, where water scarcity is a bigger problem, will likely continue to guzzle water for years longer. Microsoft says the same strategy that might eliminate water use in Amsterdam and Dublin would only reduce water consumption in desert regions by as much as 60 percent by 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3cjUJ"&gt;That’s where the second part of Microsoft’s plan comes in. To get its water footprint down to zero in those hot and dry climates, Microsoft plans to turn to a new way to cool servers: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369609/microsoft-server-cooling-liquid-immersion-cloud-racks-data-centers"&gt;submerging them in fluorocarbon-based liquid baths&lt;/a&gt;. As the servers work away, the heat they generate causes the liquid to boil when it reaches 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius). The boiling liquid moves heat away from the servers and then turns into a vapor that rises. The vapor hits a cooled tank lid, condenses, and rains back into the tub. The process, called two-phase liquid immersion, creates a closed-loop cooling system that cuts down on water and electricity use while getting rid of heat. It’s a strategy that the company says was inspired by cryptocurrency miners, who also use huge amounts of energy and have turned to liquid immersion cooling for computing equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPKglo"&gt;While experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke to say the technology is promising, they say getting it to work at scale will be another challenge. Microsoft just announced its first trial run with immersion cooling in April and says this technology is still in the research and development stage. Very few data centers — probably fewer than 2 percent — rely on immersion cooling, according to Lucas Beran, principal analyst at the market research firm Dell’Oro Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iSWgLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A massive operation switch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QBsSl"&gt;“You also think about the scale of someone like Microsoft deploying the amount of data centers that they are building and the amount of compute they’re deploying — that’s a massive supply chain switch. That’s a massive operation switch,” Beran says. Microsoft will have to study and plan for how that change will affect data center performance and train staff to work in new environments, he points out. “It’s a very large undertaking, but one that has some extremely positive potential outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knk6g6"&gt;Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will take a phased approach to rolling out its new cooling strategies for data centers. Immersion cooling will require new, specially designed servers, and Microsoft will wait for its server configurations to age out before replacing them in existing data centers. Even the plethora of new data centers the company has planned will likely first be built with hybrid cooling systems as it transitions to new immersion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDOQYG"&gt;Microsoft plans to build 50 to 100 new data centers a year to keep up with demand for its cloud services. Global internet traffic is expected to double by next year, it says. That’s a huge opportunity for the company, but also a big challenge to the company’s new sustainability goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXhxTB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pay special attention to places under more water stress&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1BCYI"&gt;Tensions have risen, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/drought-stricken-communities-push-back-against-data-centers-n1271344"&gt;around data centers in Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, where Microsoft opened up a new one this year. After federal authorities declared the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; on the Colorado River in August, Arizona faces imminent cuts to its water supply. The cuts, so far, will primarily limit water for agriculture, but some residents are worried that new data centers in the region will only intensify competition for already scarce water resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRFvbN"&gt;The company will need to address issues unique to each location where it builds a data center and pay special attention to places under more water stress. “There is no one-size-fits all type of solution,” says Uddameri. “You can become water positive as a company, but it’s not useful if you save all the water in one location, as an extreme case, and you create bigger deficits elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon updates Echo Frames to make it easier to save battery and make calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aVcjm42wjRUbtZWChmyn24uXgM=/0x1:1997x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051348/Modern_Tortoise__Sunglasses.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The existing tortoiseshell color is also getting new lens options, like sunglass.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0OYKtN"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Frames, the Alexa-enabled eyeglasses equipped with tiny speakers and microphones, are getting updated with new quality-of-life features like an automatic power-saving sleep mode and a shortcut to quickly phone a contact of your choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXytVt"&gt;There are also new gray and blue colors releasing November 10th for $249.99 which, along with the existing tortoiseshell frames, will be available with new lens options for polarized sunglass and blue-light filters for $269.99. These lens options &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441187/amazon-echo-frames-sunglasses-blue-light-filter"&gt;launched earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but until now they’ve only been available with the black frame option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azZ3VK"&gt;The new sleep mode could be particularly helpful given one of our key concerns when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;reviewed the Echo Frames last year&lt;/a&gt; was their middling battery life, which amounts to around three hours of playback from the speakers. Now, Amazon says you’ll be able to put the frames into a low-power mode by turning them upside down, and they’ll turn on automatically when worn. It’s a feature that could help minimize wasted battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mSKzFK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hands-free SMS messaging is coming to iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxtgn0"&gt;Other new features include the ability to call a priority contact with a simple long-press of the Echo Frames’ touchpad and the ability to change the Frames’ wake word from “Alexa” to “Echo.” The glasses’ automatic volume feature is also being updated so that it adjusts throughout a listening session to overcome loud ambient noise, rather than just at the start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISZMnk"&gt;Finally, the hands-free text messaging feature that’s already available on Android is expanding to iOS “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2v1mK"&gt;Amazon says the new features are coming to both new and existing Frames owners, though it hasn’t provided an exact timeframe for when they’ll be available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a damn good superhero video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sYllc1MDjdkSRn5cWnOF9Xdpoig=/239x0:3479x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051176/FCp5Ql3X0AgqKru.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A tracklist of ’80s mega-hits isn’t the only thing Guardians has going for it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CHMfgp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687700/guardians-of-the-galaxy-square-enix-action-rpg-preview"&gt;surprised the hell outta me&lt;/a&gt;. I expected standard, blockbuster action-RPG fare painted with an ’80s nostalgic gloss that would never elicit an emotion more meaningful than, “cool, they got the rights to Blondie!” And while the developers at Eidos Montreal did indeed get the rights to Blondie and an impressive host of other ’80s mainstays, I was shocked to discover a game that had so much heart and emotional depth that on several occasions, I caught myself whispering a reverent “damn” at the screen. Though combat can be a bit of a slog, every Guardian and just about every non-Guardian are so well written and voiced, you don’t mind toughing it out to get at the juicy character development bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFVvM1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; has absolutely nothing to do with the Marvel cinematic universe and just barely kisses comic continuity, though some of the characters’ backstory introduced in the movies still applies. Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, is still a man plucked from Earth in the ’80s to live a ne’er do well life in space before cleaning up his act. Gamora is the face-turned adopted daughter of Thanos. Drax is a widowed warrior from the planet Katath who is incapable of understanding sarcasm. Rocket is a space experiment gone wrong or right depending on perspective, and Groot is still the tri-syllabic tree creature whom only Rocket understands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tGsmfOSLbZjSMsSVz6QcjHVJPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957816/MGG_2021_06_14_scr_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FG0zPS"&gt;We catch up with the Guardians 12 years after the end of an intergalactic war that saw Thanos and the ruthless Chitauri empire defeated. You play as Peter Quill, pilot of the spaceship Milano and leader of the newfound Guardians of the Galaxy — a mercenary group that will do literally anything for money. Peter’s friends and colleagues are prickly, egotistical people who are still getting to know each other, and it’s your job to keep them in line as best you can as you bumble your way through ruining and then saving the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrGWgu"&gt;The characters in this game are amazing, and I love every one of them, even the ones I didn’t really care for in the movies. To avoid infringing on actors’ likenesses, all the characters look like Wal-Mart brand versions of their movie counterparts. It was off-putting at first, but I came to prefer the uncanny valley Guardian look-alikes. Drax the Destroyer never moved my needle, if you know what I mean. Dave Bautista is a good-looking guy, but I just wasn’t attracted to his Drax. And though game-Drax has the same incredibly dry personality and (mostly) the same look as movie-Drax, there’s a tenderness to him that we just didn’t see in the movies. His extreme aggression and violence are just a smokescreen hiding a man still quietly mourning the murder of his wife and child by Thanos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3glr3"&gt;Early in the game, you frequently have to defend Gamora (his family’s murderer’s daughter) against him, correcting him when he calls her “assassin” instead of her name. By the end of the game, when all the Guardians have broken down their toughest, prickliest bits, Drax starts calling Gamora by her name all on his own, and he says one of the sweetest lines I’ve ever heard in a video game — saying that if they die on their quest, he’ll ask his god if there’s room for his friends in his heaven. Naturally, I fell instantly in love. It also doesn’t hurt that Drax is a physically competent himbo who is always moving or chucking heavy objects while shirtless. Let’s just say Drax could destroy me at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgQFKjYp6AqnLfZsTH8cHLhxFbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957830/FCp60zEXoAMv8Vx.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRyPtO"&gt;Rocket Raccoon was another surprise for me. Early in the game, you have the option to throw Rocket like a football across a chasm so he can hack a panel that will create a bridge the party can use to get across. Rocket, naturally, objects to this treatment. If you choose the throw option (like I did), Rocket is furious — not because of the bodily harm, but because you violated his autonomy. Rocket Raccoon is a Looney Toon; he’s a foul-mouthed raccoon that makes things explode. Ha, ha, very funny. It’s easy to dismiss him as a joke — which is exactly how he’s treated in the movie — and it would have been very easy, expected even, for the game to continue to lean into that characterization without examining how Rocket feels about it. Though he has the appearance of a tiny, garbage-eating woodland creature, game-Rocket refuses to let people treat him as less than human. The moment is a really good example of the game’s choice / consequence system because when you throw him, Rocket won’t let you forget it, and he makes you feel like a piece of shit, which, if you do throw him, you kinda are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6jyg5"&gt;Choice in this game is really well done. The game treats your decisions with enough weight to make them feel like they matter while also throwing in cool change-ups in choice presentation. Like most games with a choice mechanic, options are presented as a dialogue box on a timer. The game pauses, and you have so many seconds to make your choice before action resumes with a little “Character will remember that” box ala the Telltale games of yore. Late in the game, in the middle of combat, Gamora says she’s going to chase after the escaping bad guy. In this situation, there was no stoppage and no dialogue box; therefore, I didn’t know there was a choice to be made at the time. The battle arena was set up such that you can follow after Gamora, or you can continue the fight with Rocket, Groot, and Drax. Wanting to back up my friend, I chased after her. The platform I was running on exploded, throwing me into what would have been a fall to my death, but Gamora rushed in to save me, thus denying her the chase. Then a box popped, “Gamora is furious you didn’t let her chase the bad guy.” I was stunned, unaware I was making a decision there, impressed with the way Eidos Montreal switched up how choice was presented, changing it from the expected piece of text you select like picking off a list to something you make your character do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1CiG5Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When you throw him, Rocket won’t let you forget it, and he makes you feel like a piece of shit, which, if you do throw him, you kinda are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ppk0l"&gt;The characters are alive in &lt;em&gt;Guardians,&lt;/em&gt; and it makes them the game’s biggest appeal. They react to what you do and the choices you make. Gamora frequently brought up me not trusting her to go after the bad guy alone, and if you wander off to explore some hidden nook or cranny looking for one of the game’s many collectibles, they call you out on it, chiding you for wasting time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zB3To"&gt;Combat is the least enjoyable part of the game, but it isn’t too big of a deal-breaker. As Peter, you’re equipped with pistols that shoot elemental bullets, and you can also command your Guardians, having them execute one of three standard abilities or a special super-move. Once you’ve mastered the stagger system, elemental properties, and issuing commands, combat becomes a rote experience to largely endure rather than enjoy. There’s just enough variety in enemy weaknesses, environmental hazards, and abilities that stringing together successful combos isn’t terribly repetitive, but combat just isn’t where this game shines. Enemies aren’t difficult, they’re time-consuming, and when the game chains battle sections back to back that are filled with the biggest, beefiest monster types, it gets to be a slog. There’s a particularly unforgivable sequence toward the end that was a never-ending corridor of battle arenas with no platforming sections interspersed to break up the action. It was the most tedious part of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUh1ffglllqXGGFbVZbeAnzhbmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957840/combat.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4FA6tM"&gt;I also did not love the controls. It was too easy to get my wires crossed, triggering a huddle when I meant to direct Rocket to throw a grenade. Huddles are an ultimate ability that buffs either you or all of your party, depending on the dialogue choice you make. They started out as a cute, little treat but quickly became very stale. In a game that is extremely good with how characters respond to events in their context, huddles are a strange aberration. The Guardian’s comments are never appropriate to the battle, and if you trigger one during a boss fight, they don’t even mention who you’re fighting. Huddles are also an unexpected source of hilarity. In addition to providing a buff and a heal for party members, a huddle will also play a song from the aforementioned ’80s hit list totally at random. I don’t know about you, but when I think of an ’80s, hotblooded, pick-me-up song, I’m not thinking of “Bad Reputation;” I’m thinking of “Wake Me Up Before you Go-Go.” The game agreed... &lt;em&gt;frequently&lt;/em&gt;. In my entire playthrough, I never once got Bonnie Tyler’s “Holding Out For A Hero” after a huddle, even though that song was played during every one of the game’s promotional videos. I held out for a hero, and nobody came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ1MEY"&gt;Like many, I enjoyed the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; movie duology more than I thought I would. It’s the same for &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;. It would have been easy to stretch the skin of a typical superhero movie plot over the bones of a standard action game and call it a day — kinda like most of &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers.&lt;/em&gt; But &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; defied being a lifeless, flesh hulk to instead be a living, breathing creature with a heart that beats and bleeds all over the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRzDer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is bringing its One UI design to its Windows laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Q8PGWmzdgxKqy-QpsOz82DPxls=/227x0:2653x1617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051028/990Suet.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MK5qA8"&gt;Samsung is bringing its One UI 4 mobile interface design to its Galaxy Book series of Windows laptops. The new design changes will appear inside Samsung’s Windows apps like Samsung Notes, Samsung Gallery, and Samsung Settings. The changes are designed to match the mobile interface that Samsung’s bringing to its latest Android phones, to make it easier to switch between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqXsI4"&gt;The main Samsung Settings app has been overhauled to better fit the design changes in Windows 11, with new app icons, menu layouts, and more. Samsung’s Notes app also has a new menu layout, updated icons, and refreshed folders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RX_WwIo1JFbNJ0QCcF7GuI9oiQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959055/990Suet.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new One UI 4 changes in Samsung’s Notes app for Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zelXuwg1t4OK_jJ2UtSWH6HE4HA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959058/PILWMcw.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Gallery includes a dark mode on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="udsdVS"&gt;The Samsung Gallery app is the final app that has been updated with One UI 4 changes, and it includes a dark mode to match Windows 11’s themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dmr25"&gt;While Microsoft has also overhauled its design language with Windows 11, Samsung’s changes here bring a more mobile-like UI to its Windows apps. Samsung is calling this One UI Book 4, and it will be available on the Galaxy Book Pro 360, Galaxy Book Pro, Galaxy Book Flex2, Galaxy Book, and Galaxy Book Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jA3Qz2"&gt;Samsung’s design effort on Windows comes after years of a close partnership between Microsoft and Samsung. The pair originally partnered to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20756647/microsoft-samsung-android-apps-partnership-galaxy-note-10-unpacked-event"&gt;bring Android and Windows closer together&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a lot of exclusive Your Phone integration for Samsung devices. Samsung has also integrated OneDrive support into its mobile apps, and Microsoft has optimized its own Office apps for Samsung’s Galaxy Fold devices. Microsoft and Samsung also have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354079/microsoft-samsung-xbox-game-pass-partnership-android-galaxy-note-20"&gt;special partnership for Xbox Game Pass on Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="W2SxyM"&gt;The move comes as car companies and transportation providers around the world are coming under regulatory pressure to phase out gas-powered vehicles in favor of those that produce zero emissions. California, the largest auto market in the US, set in place rules for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, requiring that 90 percent of their fleets be electric by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7Sn5T"&gt;Uber has long offered discounts on car rentals to drivers who don’t own their own vehicle, with Uber and Hertz working together on such a program since 2016. But they have never collaborated to rent out one specific vehicle to drivers until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTToV9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber drivers will pay $334 a week to rent a Tesla Model 3 from Hertz&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bq22S1"&gt;Starting November 1st, Uber drivers who live in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Washington, DC can rent a Tesla Model 3 through Hertz at a rate of $334 a week, including maintenance and insurance. The weekly rate will fall to $299 or lower as the program gets underway, Uber says. And the program will expand nationwide in the weeks to come — with the goal of having all 50,000 Teslas on Uber’s platform by 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKx7Ar"&gt;It may be difficult to attract drivers to the program with a weekly rate of $334, but Uber is confident that drivers will see the benefit in fuel savings and less maintenance. Also, drivers who use hybrid or electric vehicles to pick up passengers receive an extra 50 cents per ride, while drivers using specifically battery-electric vehicles get another dollar on top of that — for a total of $1.50 extra per ride. The average weekly cost for a Hertz rental car ranges from about $150 up to about $325, &lt;a href="https://www.autos.com/car-rentals/average-weekly-cost-of-a-hertz-rental-car"&gt;according to Autos.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5pmvT"&gt;Initially, drivers must have at least a 4.7-star rating and have completed at least 150 trips to be eligible to rent a Tesla. For recharging, drivers will have access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, as well as discounts at participating EVgo charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccRiyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Uber pledges to shift to ‘100 percent’ electric vehicles by 2030","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VOHlpX"&gt;Last year, Uber made the ambitious pledge to go “100 percent electric” by 2030 in the US, Canada, and Europe and by 2040 for the rest of the world. The company also said it would spend $800 million to help “hundreds of thousands of drivers in the US, Canada, and Europe transition to battery EVs by 2025” — though a spokesperson wouldn’t disclose the financial aspects of the company’s deal with Hertz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PT4Tnu"&gt;Uber’s track record with car rentals and leases isn’t exactly spotless. The company &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1125601/uber-has-ended-its-subprime-car-leasing-program-for-new-york-drivers/"&gt;shuttered a subprime auto lending program&lt;/a&gt; after drivers complained about racking up debt to pay exorbitant rates. Uber notes that this new program is designed to appeal to drivers who rent specifically, not get drivers to switch from owning to renting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFa24B"&gt;Ride-hailing was originally pitched to the public as a more environmentally friendly way to get around compared to private car ownership. But it turns out the opposite was true. Numerous studies have shown that the &lt;a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/don-anair/electrifying-ride-hailing-part-1-six-reasons-why-uber-and-lyft-must-go-electric"&gt;average ride-hailing trip creates about 50 percent more pollution than the average traditional car trip&lt;/a&gt;. Even worse, over half of all ride-hailing trips in major cities are made by people who would have &lt;a href="http://www.schallerconsult.com/rideservices/automobility.htm"&gt;otherwise used cleaner means of transit to get to their destination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGHTYv"&gt;Today, however, fewer than 1 percent of ride-hailing vehicles in the US are electric, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/california-sets-green-car-goals-for-ride-hailers-like-lyft-uber"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The auto industry is in the midst of a massive transition to electric vehicles, even though EVs still only compromise less than 5 percent of annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvZ1ic"&gt;Uber isn’t the first company to use Teslas as a ride-hailing vehicle. Earlier this year, moped rental company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405539/revel-ride-share-nyc-tesla-model-y-moped-uber"&gt;Revel announced its own Uber-esque ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; in New York City with 50 bright blue Tesla Model Y vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Police arrest 150 suspects after closure of dark web’s largest illegal marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1tZias3x7qmEwb3zjxZisjCga7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050887/acastro_180109_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcshw6"&gt;A 10-month investigation following the closure of the dark web’s largest illegal marketplace, DarkMarket, has resulted in the arrest of 150 suspected drug vendors and buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSF4DU"&gt;DarkMarket was taken offline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227929/darkmarket-shutdown-europol-worlds-largest-illegal-marketplace"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as part of an international operation. The site boasted some 500,000 users and facilitated around 320,000 transactions, reports the EU’s law enforcement agency, Europol, with clientele buying and selling everything from malware and stolen credit card information, to weapons and drugs. When German authorities arrested the site’s alleged operator in January this year, they also seized valuable evidence of transactions which led to this week’s arrest of key players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DChyqU"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-law-enforcement-operation-targeting-opioid-traffickers-darknet-results-150"&gt;US Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/150-arrested-in-dark-web-drug-bust-police-seize-%E2%82%AC26-million"&gt;Europol&lt;/a&gt;, Operation Dark HunTor saw law enforcement make numerous arrests in the United States (65), Germany (47), the United Kingdom (24), Italy (4), the Netherlands (4), France, (3), Switzerland (2), and Bulgaria (1). More than $31.6 million in cash and cryptocurrencies were seized during the arrests, as well 45 firearms and roughly 234 kilograms of drugs including cocaine, opioids, amphetamine, MDMA, and fentanyl. According to the DoJ: “A number of investigations are still ongoing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tggEmu"&gt;As part of the operation, Italian authorities also shut down two other dark web marketplaces — DeepSea and Berlusconi — arresting four alleged administrators and seizing €3.6 million ($4.17 million) in cryptocurrency. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJXxBBoYynM15_64l-m264yxI1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959037/darkhuntor_social_media_map.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Europol&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The operation was conducted across the US, Europe, and Australia.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UtvYr9"&gt;Although the dark web was once considered to be a relatively safe haven for those selling and buying drugs, international operations like Dark HunTor have seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;regular arrests of suspects and speedy closure of marketplaces&lt;/a&gt;. The list of dark web markets closed just in recent years is extensive, including Dream, WallStreet, White House, DeepSea, and Dark Market. Although law enforcement certainly have to play Whac-A-Mole with such sites, with new markets springing up as soon as established ones are closed, doing so makes it harder for buyers and sellers to build steady businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VTvI3"&gt;“The point of operations such as the one today is to put criminals operating on the dark web on notice: the law enforcement community has the means and global partnerships to unmask them and hold them accountable for their illegal activities, even in areas of the dark web,” said Europol’s Deputy Executive Director of Operations, Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, in a &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-law-enforcement-operation-targeting-opioid-traffickers-darknet-results-150"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to get the Google Play Store running on Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAeQobD1JWnJusncAuCgFIr_MP0=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050875/Hdh35Ti.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Play Store running on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOm0Dj"&gt;A developer and design student has managed to get the Google Play Store working on Windows 11. Google’s Android app store is fully functional within Windows 11 using this method, allowing you to install a game or app and run it alongside traditional Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCVfpn"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737102/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-feature-hands-on"&gt;started testing Windows 11 Android app support&lt;/a&gt; last week, but the official implementation is limited to the Amazon Appstore and less than 50 apps during the preview phase. Getting the Google Play Store installed opens Windows 11 up to every Android app or game you’d want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQbJkp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ADeltaXForce"&gt;ADeltaX&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian UX design student, has successfully installed the Google Play Store on Windows 11, and detailed all the steps required to get it working. If you’re not familiar with Linux commands or command prompts, then the install process won’t be the most straightforward, but ADeltaX &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIt00xDp0tM"&gt;has created a video guide&lt;/a&gt; for those who really want to get this running.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MbraUscY8eA6o1PTn0OJm5zwhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959042/aAxYUbo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gmail Android app running alongside a mobile Android game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QNZ6wk"&gt;I managed to get the Google Play Store up and running on Windows 11 in about 30 minutes, after downloading all the necessary tools, enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and installing Ubuntu. The result is a fully functional Play Store that you can use to install any Android app on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPVrLm"&gt;The full instructions for the install process are &lt;a href="https://github.com/ADeltaX/WSAGAScript"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or through the YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIt00xDp0tM"&gt;walkthrough video&lt;/a&gt;. We’re expecting Microsoft to make the Windows Subsystem for Android available to all Windows 11 users in the coming months, alongside Amazon Appstore support.&lt;/p&gt;
