    <title>You can get a PS5 at GameStop right now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s8fCEl"&gt;GameStop has released some precious stock of the PS5 consoles, both for the $499.99 disc-based version and the disc-less model that costs $100 less. However, it’s offering them in bundles, as GameStop has been wont to do since the console launched late last year. Stock is coming in and out, as usual, so stay on the page if you want to ensure the best chance that you’ll get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cj0S3"&gt;You can get the disc-based console with &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt;, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-mlb-the-show-21-and-returnal-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $729.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fUp5OE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UauFSn"&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171U.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the disc-less model comes in a $599.99 bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a second DualSense controller, a $20 GameStop gift card, a $50 credit for the PlayStation Store, and a one-year subscription to PS Plus for online gaming and complimentary downloads each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jOKl1L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8HQ6j"&gt;If you want some extra games and accessories for your (hopefully) new PS5, check out some suggestions below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yxm7hx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s Anker’s apology after 712 Eufy customers had camera feeds exposed to strangers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qn69jZgQxCRLhfiFXhrwiKd2eKk=/824x0:1814x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312547/191106_165716_9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker/Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wMQrSX"&gt;Eufy has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EufyOfficial/status/1395064482804731907"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; apologizing for a glitch that occurred two days ago, allowing some Eufy home security camera users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440298/eufy-privacy-glitch-server-error-camera-feed-exposed"&gt;to see video from other users’ homes&lt;/a&gt;. The statement explains that it happened during a software update, but the company claims it only affected a small number of users: just 712 people across the US, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Eufy says that the issue was fixed with an emergency update less than two hours after it was identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW8k7P"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Eufy confirmed that “users were able to access video feeds from other users’ cameras.” However, in its official statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EufyOfficial/status/1395064482804731907"&gt;posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (which can be viewed in full below), Eufy doesn’t explain what the bug actually was. It does say it’s working to keep this from happening again in the future, by upgrading its network and the authentication mechanisms between the cameras, servers, and app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7wezI"&gt;The initial reports of the bug &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;came from Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, with users reporting that they were able to see and control the live feeds from all the Eufy cameras in someone else’s home, as well as see any previously recorded footage and the other user’s email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ1vq9"&gt;Eufy suggests that that users in the affected countries (listed above) should unplug then replug their security home base, then log out of the Eufy security app before logging back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRijJ9"&gt;The full statement is below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dYJfOC"&gt;During a software update performed on our server in the United States on May 17th at 4:50 AM EDT, a bug occurred affecting a limited number of users in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Users in Europe and other regions remain unaffected. Our engineering team identified the issue at 5:30 AM EDT and immediately rolled back the server version and deployed an emergency update. The incident was fixed at 6:30 AM EDT. We have confirmed that a total of 712 users were affected in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Oe4M8"&gt;Although the issue has been resolved, we recommend users in the affected countries (US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and Cuba) to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9au7fl"&gt;- Please unplug and then reconnect the eufy security home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z39RaK"&gt;- Log out of the eufy security app and log in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PojYd"&gt;All of our user video data is stored locally on the users’ devices. As a service provider, eufy provides account management, device management, and remote P2P access for users through AWS servers. All stored data and account information is encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNDzFS"&gt;In order to avoid this happening in the future, we are taking the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCfptt"&gt;- We are upgrading our network architecture and strengthening our two-way authentication mechanism between the servers, devices, and the eufy Security app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjfd36"&gt;- We are upgrading our servers to improve their processing capacity in order to eliminate potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teVTKM"&gt;- We are also in the process of obtaining the TUV and BSI Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) certifications which will further improve our product security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koFQwB"&gt;We understand that we need to build trust again with our customers. Thank you for trusting us with your security and our team is available 24/7 at &lt;a href="mailto:support@eufylife.com"&gt;support@eufylife.com&lt;/a&gt; and Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM (PT) through our online chat on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Feufylife.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444164%2Feufy-security-camera-glitch-privacy-feed-exposed-statement-details" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eufylife.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 things we know about the new smartwatch OS from Google and Samsung — and some we don’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESs1F_Zl_AyG-xjOgNOkUM36xkg=/23x0:1592x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312329/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_1.48.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJLmvt"&gt;Yesterday brought the momentous news that Google and Samsung will merge together their Wear OS and Tizen-based smartwatch platforms into a single operating system. The new software is currently being referred to as Wear, but that name could change as we get closer to the first devices that will ship with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkqJBd"&gt;The unified platform is intended to give Android smartwatches a huge boost and much simpler strategy. It will also allow developers to create apps and widgets for a single OS instead of splitting their efforts between Wear OS and Tizen. A lot of this is spelled out in more detail in the below video, but let’s also focus on the big highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3d2POI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYIb9g1r4lw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PCl44B"&gt;It’s going to be faster than Wear OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6mEUO8"&gt;Speed and responsiveness were one of the major talking points when Google and Samsung made this announcement during the I/O 2021 keynote. The companies are claiming that apps open up to 30 percent faster than they currently do on Wear OS. Google also promises “smooth user interface animations and motion,” which hasn’t always been a strength of Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V5mrLs"&gt;Battery life will be a step up, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Ap1m"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches were already routinely outlasting Wear OS products, so this doesn’t come as a surprise. The company is lending Google some hardware expertise to ensure better stamina. “Samsung implemented our best technology to provide optimized performances, and advanced sensor batching and low power display technology to ensure an efficient and long-lasting battery,” &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here/"&gt;Samsung’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Janghyun Yoon wrote&lt;/a&gt; after Tuesday’s news. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/wear-io21/"&gt;Google’s Bjorn Kilburn said&lt;/a&gt; customers can expect “handy optimizations like the ability to run the heart rate sensor continuously during the day, track your sleep overnight and still have battery for the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s57RXPu8xV8gdBssRwTANsqbDbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523438/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U7FD3y"&gt;The next Samsung Galaxy Watch will run Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1vPwBI"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that its next smartwatch — and all others in the pipeline — will run the unified Wear platform. But the company made sure to note that it will bring over some of its popular hardware elements, like the rotating bezel mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eSi1MG"&gt;A standalone Google Maps app will do turn-by-turn directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USphat"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-wear-os-io-samsung-fitbit-partnership/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we learned that there are plans for a Google Maps app on Wear that features “a new user interface that will also work even if your phone is not with you.” That hints at cellular data support on the new unified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7HbPmQ"&gt;Spotify and YouTube Music apps will support offline downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KJQ7bt"&gt;Spotify already allows owners of Samsung smartwatches to download songs for offline listening, and now that same convenience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;will be extended to Wear&lt;/a&gt;. That’s one thing Spotify for the Apple Watch still doesn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN1lTr"&gt;Google also confirmed that YouTube Music will be available on Wear. Like Spotify, it’ll include full support for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dj07Co"&gt;Fitbit activity tracking will be built into the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gLK3qO"&gt;Having completed its acquisition of Fitbit at the start of this year, Google will now integrate some of the brand’s health and activity tracking features into Wear. Future premium Fitbit wearables will also run the unified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gccHxx"&gt;Device makers will be able to customize the look and feel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7v57H"&gt;Google tried to emphasize on Tuesday that this platform isn’t just intended for itself and Samsung. “All device makers will be able to add a customized user experience on top of the platform,” Kilburn said. That’s going to prove important if Google wants to keep companies like Garmin on board with the new platform. And we can’t forget about the many traditional watchmakers — Fossil, Citizen, TAG Heuer, and others — that have gotten behind Wear OS in recent years in the absence of a flagship smartwatch from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j0uZLt"&gt;Apps should be faster and easier to develop with new APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chEw9f"&gt;Wear’s apps will use the latest Android development techniques like Jetpack and Kotlin to help reach the best possible performance. Google is also promising to make life easier for app makers with new APIs that cover Tiles, health services, watchfaces, complications, and more. And an activity indicator will show when certain functions are running in the background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XyPTaD"&gt;Some Wear OS smartwatches might get upgraded to Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q2OdZD"&gt;There aren’t any firm promises yet, but Google at least didn’t outright say existing products &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be updated to the new OS. The company told &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/wear-os-revamp-current-models/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “we will have more updates to share on timelines once the new version launches later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qPkD6H"&gt;Samsung will not update Galaxy Watch models to Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8uudYx"&gt;Samsung will not be updating its Galaxy Watch line to Wear, but says it has no intention of leaving its current customers in the dust once it starts releasing Wear hardware. “For customers who already own the Tizen OS based Galaxy smartwatches, we are continuing to provide at least three years of software support after the product launch,” the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;company said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. However, it seems plausible there will be more than a few features and new Wear tricks that will never make their way to older Galaxy smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjuRQV"&gt;Samsung will bring over its watchface designer tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cupd81"&gt;Some people out there really care about having a good watchface selection on a pricey smartwatch. Google and Samsung are promising a wide mix of styles, and Samsung told Wired its design tool — and many of the company’s own signature watchfaces — will be available on Wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71558Q"&gt;The unknowns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ekd1iU"&gt;Google and Samsung shared a decent chunk of information on day one, but we’re still left without answers to a few important questions. We should learn more details over the summer as we head into fall hardware season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PhmIyB"&gt;When will the first Wear smartwatch be available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sVmmhq"&gt;Is the underlying operating system closer to Wear OS or closer to Tizen? (Considering that developers will be using Android tools to build apps, it seems like the former.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNbgne"&gt;Will there be required helper apps like some of Samsung’s watches have needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kwdrOg"&gt;Is Wear going to continue offering some semblance of iOS support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eglWmQ"&gt;What’s going to happen to Samsung Pay and Bixby? Are they both goners on the wrist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is getting new animated Batman and Superman shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LSHw-Vvq6qCX8PHFxbbZ1xsS8NQ=/0x35:696x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312306/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YhjVg8"&gt;HBO Max is getting a pair of new animated DC shows: &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-and-cartoon-network-make-series-commitment-batman-caped-crusader"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: The Caped Crusader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/cartoon-network-9/hbo-max-and-cartoon-network-take-flight-series-commitment-my-adventures-superman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Adventures with Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXofpd"&gt;The two shows appear pretty different in tone. &lt;em&gt;The Caped Crusader&lt;/em&gt;, coming from a team that includes J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves (the director of the upcoming &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;), and Bruce Timm (one of the co-creators of the fan-favorite &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;) promises a noir-ish “reimagining” of the character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXO5Ov"&gt;“The series will be thrilling, cinematic and evocative of Batman’s noir roots, while diving deeper into the psychology of these iconic characters,” Abrams, Reeves, and Timm commented in a joint announcement. The teaser poster showcasing the art style for the series seems to back up the darker tone, with a grim-looking Batman (with an old-school pointed ear cowl) staring down at Gotham City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAwGbLPKkJsvryswR9QkjddiRZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526037/Batman_Caped_Crusader_Promo_Poster_May_2021_01.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpSIC7"&gt;On the flip side of the thematic coin is &lt;em&gt;My Adventures with Superman&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which will follow the 20-something lives of Clark Kent (Jack Quaid), Lois Lane (Alice Lee), and Jimmy Olsen as they collectively start their journalism careers, fall in love, and for Clark, start his burgeoning career as the Man of Steel. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiHdXVai8CgqqaGrYrq_wOkCwu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526046/WBA_Superman_Image_copy.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UAptqG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Adventures with Superman &lt;/em&gt;has already been ordered for two seasons and will be executive produced by Sam Register (&lt;em&gt;Teen Titans Go!&lt;/em&gt;), Jake Wyatt (&lt;em&gt;Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus&lt;/em&gt;), and Brendan Clogher (&lt;em&gt;Voltron: Legendary Defender&lt;/em&gt;). And based on the promotional image, expect it to fit in the mode of those more family-friendly animated shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O17csq"&gt;The fact that WarnerMedia is looking to expand its animated superhero portfolio isn’t a surprise: the streaming company has already found success with shows like &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;(which, like &lt;em&gt;Caped Crusader&lt;/em&gt;, is co-created by Bruce Timm), originally on DC Universe and then later on HBO Max after the company consolidated content there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s Discovery deal is about taking on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8uraA"&gt;Early Monday morning, AT&amp;amp;T announced a sudden change in direction: it reached an agreement to spin off WarnerMedia — the conglomerate of Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, DC Comics, and more — into a new company to be merged with Discovery. While Discovery’s roster of the Cooking Channel, Travel Channel, and Food Network is a whole lot less exciting than WarnerMedia’s lineup of &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, the combined company brings together the components needed to build a new streaming giant. And it’s already clear that this new Discovery-Warner hybrid has Disney in its sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCK6GL"&gt;“It’s a combination of bulking up both sides of the business, creating a more compelling direct-to-consumer offering for HBO Max or Discovery Plus,” Neil Macker, an equity analyst at Morningstar, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w5GCNf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WarnerMedia emerges as the biggest winner&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dM9zBO"&gt;WarnerMedia has done well so far. Its streaming platform, HBO Max, hit 64 million subscribers a year after it launched. But it’s only around half the size of Disney Plus (which is about a year and a half old) and a third the size of Netflix. And AT&amp;amp;T, it seemed, didn’t have the sustained interest to see it overtake them. AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkStreet/status/1394297818723016710"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Squawk on the Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that WarnerMedia needed a home where shareholders would be willing to “take that ride” to see the company grow as big as it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM4jOO"&gt;The basics of the deal make sense for AT&amp;amp;T. A telecom company was never going to do a stellar job running a media arm (see: Verizon and Yahoo, AOL and Time Warner, the Snyder Cut), and it can use cash from the sale to help build out its still very-much-in-the-works 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCeuCV"&gt;But WarnerMedia may be the bigger winner. It gets out from under the &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/richard-plepler-leaving-hbo-27-years-cable-giant-1191494/"&gt;rocky leadership&lt;/a&gt; of AT&amp;amp;T, and it becomes the star of the new business. It’s a far bigger company than Discovery, with $30.4 billion in 2020 in revenue to Discovery’s $10.7 billion. And Discovery is ready to spend big on content to let WarnerMedia match its rivals: it’s planning to put $20 billion per year toward content, a number rivaling Netflix ($17 billion) and exceeding Disney (which plans to hit $14–16 billion by 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zruxtx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aiming to double Netflix in subscribers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8Tesj"&gt;Even before the new investment, the companies’ combined content library offers advantages for both sides. The new company will bring together WarnerMedia’s roster of pop culture phenomena — the types of major shows and movies known to drive signups — with Discovery’s deep well of reality shows, which “do well on streaming platforms,” Macker says, and tend to be useful for retaining subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4knLjk"&gt;In interview after interview this week, Discovery CEO David Zaslav mentioned WarnerMedia’s big properties — &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/em&gt;came up a lot — and praised the fact that the company had the rights to show those titles themselves. The combined company won’t be entirely at the whims of ever-shifting content deals that can make top titles vanish from streaming services month to month, and it can guarantee a steady roster of hits, much like Disney Plus offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P6607"&gt;“The other thing we have that some of those companies don’t have,” Zaslav &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1394305919299751947"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, is “great, great IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TEqkxb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Discovery still needs to sell investors on its plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGANFm"&gt;That’s a significant leg up on Netflix, which doesn’t have a long list of iconic properties. And it’s hard not to hear Zaslav taking aim at Disney when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1394380620567035907"&gt;he tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the acquisition “makes us a real formidable global IP business to compete with the best in the business.” (Already, the former head of Disney Plus has been &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/ex-tiktok-ceo-seen-as-contender-for-discovery-warnermedia-streaming/"&gt;rumored as a contender&lt;/a&gt; to run the combined company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fuwijm"&gt;Zaslav’s goals are big. On CNBC, he discussed hitting “2-, 3-, 400 million homes over the long term,” a number that would double what Netflix has today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpBmsX"&gt;There’s more to that plan than just building an enormous Disney Plus competitor. Across the TV and film industry, revenues are starting to shift to streaming. But Discovery still has a huge TV business that it plans to keep growing. The company has been working to expand its news and sports channels throughout Europe (Zaslav suggested CNN could play a part in that), and the addition of WarnerMedia’s shows and channels will let Discovery “super-serve advertisers” and sell its content as a bundle on cable, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hy7vzR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the same strategy, just bigger than before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKQuDS"&gt;Macker says that’s the same strategy Disney is taking: using its existing successful businesses — in Disney’s case, ESPN, movie studios, and soon, theme parks once again — to build out its next area of growth. “All those parts generate cash,” he says. “You’re investing in direct-to-consumer for long term growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WPFlz"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery still face serious challenges. Most immediately, it seems likely that WarnerMedia could face a leadership vacuum while the deal is under review, with the company’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/business/jason-kilar-warnermedia.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;reportedly seeking an exit&lt;/a&gt;. And while Discovery is eager to build a streaming giant, it ultimately won’t be up to Discovery’s current leadership and shareholders. AT&amp;amp;T shareholders will own most of the combined company, so Zaslav will need to sell them on this investment — an investment that Stankey suggested AT&amp;amp;T investors weren’t sure about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddAars"&gt;Mostly, combining the two companies seems to be a bet that the current streaming landscape — with an assortment of large and small streamers — isn’t going to last much longer. Combining WarnerMedia and Discovery is about surviving the crash that may destroy smaller services and emerging stronger on the other side. The two companies aren’t promising to do anything special or unique: they’re just going to do what they’re already doing — but together and bigger. That’s good news if you want to subscribe to fewer services at once, though it’ll be some time before we know if it’ll lead to better shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning announcement: how to watch the electric pickup truck’s debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQLXBw-FcFtKmBUezm5njyOyt4o=/590x0:6961x4247/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312135/Lightning_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6tXBf"&gt;Ford is getting ready to pull the curtain back on its latest electric vehicle. The F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the automaker’s bestselling pickup truck, will take center stage at Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn, MI, at 9:30PM ET on Wednesday, May 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYskvW"&gt;Ford says there will be “30+ ways to watch across physical and digital destinations,” including live streams on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjisj5T0VqE"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1390749496494022657"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ford/posts/10159043571770049"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The event will also be broadcast in several public locations like Times Square in New York City and Las Vegas Boulevard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B4xdiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“30+ ways to watch across physical and digital destinations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZRjPe"&gt;It’s a lot of hoopla for a truck that’s been in the works for over four years and has already been seen publicly, with and without camouflage. We got our first real look at the F-150 Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442415/ford-f150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-images"&gt;during President Joe Biden’s visit&lt;/a&gt; to the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsSUTV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yjisj5T0VqE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmwl97"&gt;Still, most of the relevant specs are being kept under wraps (although Biden let slip that he believed the 0-60mph time to be a little more than four seconds). Details like battery size, range, trim levels, and price should be on the bill for the Wednesday evening event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAnwzh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441793/ford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details"&gt;Ford has a lot riding on the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the company’s second major mass-market EV, after the Mustang Mach-E, and its first battery-powered pickup truck. Ford has said it would spend $22 billion over the next five years on electric vehicles — or a little more than half of what the company makes in revenue in one year of F-series sales. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Dark Patterns tip line lets you report evil tech company menus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xf7dkgSOnfety0SB438wexivZcY=/0x0:1221x814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311898/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_9.40.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Consumer Reports&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqIJld"&gt;If you’re ever annoyed by a website or app trying to trick you by using small text, brightly colored buttons, or tricky toggles, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CRAdvocacy/status/1395031496671567875?s=20"&gt;there’s a new tip line&lt;/a&gt; you can use to report the bad behavior, run by Consumer Reports Advocacy. The &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org"&gt;Dark Patterns Tip Line&lt;/a&gt; aims to collect various examples of dark patterns, defined by the website as “design tactics used in websites and apps to persuade you into doing things you probably would not do otherwise,” and use those examples to fight back against the companies that are behaving poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek59iR"&gt;Even if you’ve never heard the term “dark pattern” before, you’ve likely come across one. Consumer Reports provides a list of examples in a tweet, and on the tip line’s site, but there are entire websites (like &lt;a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org"&gt;darkpatterns.org&lt;/a&gt;) and subreddits dedicated to showing examples from across the internet. Former president Donald Trump’s campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365952/trump-dark-patterns-trick-supporters-recurring-donation-winred-gary-coby"&gt;even used them to trick supporters&lt;/a&gt; into donating way more than they intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gwHDut"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DarkPattern?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DarkPattern&lt;/a&gt; examples:&lt;br&gt;-You can’t exit an ad because the “X” is so small&lt;br&gt;-You try to buy something and a site sneaks an extra item into your cart &lt;br&gt;-You’re forced to provide your phone number to register a new account&lt;br&gt;-You’re silently charged for a subscription after a trial ends&lt;/p&gt;— Consumer Reports Advocacy (@CRAdvocacy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CRAdvocacy/status/1395031498584215556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ju2Lo"&gt;There has been some legislation around dark patterns, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333506/california-bans-dark-patterns-opt-out-selling-data"&gt;California banning ones&lt;/a&gt; that trick users into giving away private information earlier this year, but it’s still an area where government has been slow to step in. Consumer Reports hopes to, in part, use the submissions from the tip line as evidence when speaking to lawmakers. It also hopes the site will help inform consumers about how to avoid the unscrupulous designs, and hold companies accountable for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk65Bt"&gt;If you want to see other people’s submissions to the tip line, you can go to its &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/sightings"&gt;Sightings page&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have a submission yourself, you can go to &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/report"&gt;the Report page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline CEO confirms company paid $4.4 million ransom it wasn’t supposed to pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Colonial Pipeline Resumes Operations After Hack Causing Gas Shortages" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V82hlLH0bPQktnPPaBLn_OBbj-c=/0x0:4164x2776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311812/1232866318.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3PFwWL"&gt;Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount has confirmed that his company did in fact pay $4.4 million to the hackers responsible for the ransomware attack on the pipeline system that transports around 45 percent of fuel used on the East Coast, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-why-he-paid-hackers-a-4-4-million-ransom-11621435636?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier reporting estimated Colonial Pipeline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;paid a ransom of nearly $5 million&lt;/a&gt;, news that was surprising — not for the amount of money that was paid, but because paying ransoms to cybercriminals is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/"&gt;frowned upon by law enforcement agencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmLYa0"&gt;The situation with Colonial Pipeline is further complicated by the fact that the Colonial Pipeline Company itself was responsible for the shutdown. Blount tells the&lt;em&gt; Journal&lt;/em&gt; that its operational systems weren’t directly impacted, but it shut down the critical energy infrastructure so that it could determine how far hackers reached into its system. Before today’s confirmation, both &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and cybersecurity reporter &lt;a href="https://zetter.substack.com/p/ransomware-infection-on-colonial"&gt;Kim Zetter&lt;/a&gt; suggested hackers specifically had access to the company’s billing system, rather than direct control over the pipeline itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXvTOu"&gt;DarkSide, the hackers responsible for the attack, were also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;oddly apologetic&lt;/a&gt; that their ransomware caused so much trouble, even though they ultimately got what they wanted. “Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,” the group wrote in a statement. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/15/colonial-pipeline-resumes-normal-operations-after-hack.html"&gt;fuel shortages&lt;/a&gt; followed, and Colonial Pipeline said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437730/colonial-pipeline-normal-ransomware-attack-fuel"&gt;just got back to normal operations&lt;/a&gt; on May 15th. Blount tells &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;the work to rebuild its business system is ongoing, though — it’s still unable to bill customers after the outage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android phones can finally tap to pay for public transit in the SF Bay Area</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A train approaches MacArthur BART Station on Friday, November 2, 2018 in Oakland, Calif." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVA_fv5OIgAgDSECrj-1tp6t7iQ=/0x0:2691x1794/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69311786/1298602323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Osborne/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ct3tGu"&gt;In 2010, the San Francisco Bay Area introduced a single tap-to-pay NFC card for practically all its public transit — and Google introduced &lt;a href="https://www.nfcw.com/2010/12/07/35385/google-unveils-first-android-nfc-phone-but-nexus-s-is-limited-to-tag-reading-only-for-now/"&gt;the first NFC-equipped Android smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. Now, over a decade later, the two ideas are finally compatible. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/google-pay"&gt;you can finally digitize a Clipper card into most Android phones&lt;/a&gt;, or buy one there to start, then tap it to ride 24 different transit systems in SF and the greater Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZ4bgQ"&gt;Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386692/bart-caltrain-muni-ferry-apple-pay-clipper-card-sf-bay-area-iphone-watch"&gt;added the same functionality to iPhones and Apple Watches last month&lt;/a&gt;, and here’s how I described it at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nYXTjU"&gt;You can now use almost any recent iPhone or Apple Watch to board BART (which serves the East Bay and San Francisco), Muni (San Francisco’s bus and light rail system), Caltrain (which connects San Francisco to the peninsula and South Bay), VTA (South Bay buses and light rail), and even the ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLkQEk"&gt;That means travel across practically the entire urban and suburban Bay Area without pulling a wallet out of your purse or pocket — particularly since many of those vehicles also fit bikes on board. It’s not quite as significant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13401092/apple-pay-japan-suica-felica-nfc"&gt;as when Apple Pay came to Japan’s Suica in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, since that rail network spans an entire country, but it’s a big deal for tech workers and natives like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0IG1mS"&gt;With Google Pay, most NFC-equipped phones with Android 5.0 or higher are compatible — but not Motorola devices due to “inconsistent experiences” — and Samsung users will have to set Google Pay as their default wallet app, &lt;a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/clipper-on-your-phone"&gt;according to this FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. It also doesn’t work for bikeshare or a few specific types of passes. Importantly, Google says if you load a Clipper card into Google Pay, you won’t be able to use the physical card anymore.

&lt;p id="EMI88h"&gt;While the SF Bay Area may be home to many Google (and Apple) employees, it’s just one of the metros where Google is planning to ingest these cards — Google says Chicago and Washington, DC are both coming soon, and there’s a transit shortcut on the home screen of the Google Pay app that’ll also let you pay for parking in 400 cities and transit in “70+ smaller towns and cities,” according to Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M51KOF"&gt;A Google rep also tells us that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287043/google-maps-pay-parking-public-transportation-cities"&gt;the previously announced ability to buy train tickets directly from Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; is still coming later on. That could come in handy for those who &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; regular commuters but discover that a quick public transit ride can get them from A to B. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to truly wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are best for you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant have better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. You can get a new pair for $190 at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-pro-29%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;, or for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163118618412109#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; also have them in stock for $230 and $220, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$113 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939592542498948" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, they are $140 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939709636141261" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are a couple of deals going on right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-black%2F-%2FA-82026965&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are offering the Galaxy Buds Pro for $180. Other retailers, specifically &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939849926817180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, are selling the Buds Pro as well, however, at their normal retail price ($200).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. You can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus at MSRP for $150 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163658038651288#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163599620332399#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;If you don’t mind picking up a refurbished model, you can get the Galaxy Buds Live for $80 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168432735464332#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now. If you prefer a new pair, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163822566645183#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1739163884892789421#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; all currently offer the Buds Live for $170, the usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740940140202691153" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-85t?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_campaign=100084481&amp;amp;cjevent=d1b5f6f7b81f11eb80a000a90a1c0e0c#/donotlink#100-99190700-98" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the discounted, $180 price tag is still intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. We consider the Jabra 75t the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available right now for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Best Buy for $160 in either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773015236913845" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EyyuGg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;The 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a tremendous value at $120, however, if the price remains a factor and you don’t mind opting for their last-gen counterpart, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1512892-REG%2Famazon_b07f6vm1s3_echo_buds.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is currently offering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Buds for $100&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t sound as satisfying, nor are they as comfortable, but they still provide effective noise reduction and easy access to Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
