    <title>DoorDash adds in-app safety features, but couriers need more protection</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wMt3Ur"&gt;DoorDash is &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/11/03/doordash-launches-safedash/"&gt;adding a set of tools for its delivery workers called “SafeDash,”&lt;/a&gt; which includes a way to contact an agent from the ADT security company or to call 911 through ADT. The company is first launching the tool in major cities like Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, but says it’ll roll out to all its US couriers by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYPydm"&gt;While it’s good that DoorDash is acknowledging the dangers its delivery workers face, some advocates say that SafeDash won’t help solve the problems of thieves targeting them for their money or bikes, and the apps giving them routes that put them in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UXgXK"&gt;According to DoorDash, SafeDash will give delivery workers a button that will have an ADT agent call them if they feel unsafe. That ADT agent will also be able to contact the authorities if the driver is unresponsive, or if something obviously goes wrong. Delivery workers will also be able to skip the call in an emergency situation and have ADT contact 911 for them. The security company will be able to give the Dasher’s GPS location to the police and will communicate with the delivery worker through text so they can relay information to authorities without having to actually talk out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZywcoDMSfXN3s25krWkCm-W3NM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22986431/SOS2__1_.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can either connect with an ADT agent or have them contact 911 for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9ZJI2"&gt;Those who work for DoorDash and other services like it face a variety of dangers posed by inattentive drivers, poor infrastructure, the weather, and other people. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed the danger bike delivery workers in New York City can face when their route includes going over bridges or through tunnels where they’re often ambushed by people looking to steal the expensive e-bikes they need to stay competitive. Through it all, they’re expected to complete deliveries on time — otherwise, they worry they might be downgraded and get fewer gig offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Iytj6F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hzxfdl"&gt;One of DoorDash’s competitors, Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us"&gt;also has a panic button&lt;/a&gt; that works in a similar way for drivers, couriers, and riders. But some delivery workers, whose work puts them at risk of injury and robbery, feel like a technology-based solution isn’t going to fix the issue. “We don’t need an app to call 911,” Hildalyn Colón-Hernández from the Worker’s Justice Project told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, she says, workers need to be able to choose areas that they feel safe working, and not face penalties for prioritizing their safety over a completed delivery. While New York City &lt;a href="https://www.romanolaw.com/2021/09/30/special-delivery-new-yorks-new-protections-for-food-delivery-workers/"&gt;is working on legislation&lt;/a&gt; to codify those kinds of protections into law, protections will still be needed for workers in other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w324tY"&gt;Hernández says that by adding the SafeDash feature, DoorDash is signaling that it knows it has a responsibility to keep its workers safe, which it hasn’t necessarily done enough in the past. The dangers delivery workers face have been shown in reports by both advocacy organizations like &lt;a href="https://losdeliveristasunidos.org/ldu-report"&gt;the WJP and Los Deliveristas Unidos&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;media outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but until recently they haven’t been faced head-on by companies, legislators, or &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/storm-ida-food-delivery-drivers-wade-through-waist-high-floods-2021-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;even customers&lt;/a&gt;. They’re still an everyday reality for delivery workers, though — Hernández says that 19 NYC Deliveristas have died on the job in the past 18 months alone, and there &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/doordash-adds-safety-features-protect-drivers-80949644"&gt;have been other incidents throughout the country&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSsCQp"&gt;While delivery apps may be beginning to acknowledge that they have a role to play in keeping their workers safe, society is still grappling with how gig workers should be treated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;California voters passed Proposition 22&lt;/a&gt; almost exactly a year ago, which made it legal for companies like DoorDash, Lyft, and Uber to classify their workers as contractors instead of employees (and therefore exempt them from benefits like company-provided health insurance). The law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;has since been ruled as unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>League of Legends and Valorant are now available in the Epic Games Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKd1pGg-vSimAYNHbw7Bv1HDup4=/54x0:1217x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70095071/FDXPMHBUYAITXEz.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Riot games are now available on the Epic Games Store.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9yY9yT"&gt;Riot Games’ &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Teamfight Tactics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/em&gt; are now available to download from the Epic Games Store, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/riot-games-brings-league-of-legends-valorant-and-more-to-epic-games-store"&gt;the two companies announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. They’re free to download and play, just like they are from Riot. When you get them from the Epic Games Store, your computer will install the Riot Client, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679479/riot-games-new-client-pc-launcher-library"&gt;Riot’s new unified launcher&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you can actually install and launch the individual games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yVeeO"&gt;This isn’t the first time Epic has offered a way to get another company’s launcher; you’ve been able to download the Itch.io launcher from the Epic Games Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;since April&lt;/a&gt;. Epic’s willingness to include apps with other launchers is in line with CEO Tim Sweeney’s long-standing support for more open app distribution models. It’s something Sweeney directly emailed Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419618/tim-sweeney-email-tim-cook-wwdc-2015-ios-open-platform-antitrust"&gt;to advocate for on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and Epic is also locked in legal battles with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687968/fortnite-ios-epic-apple-appeal-verdict-antitrust"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; after it added a direct payment system to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in violation of the two companies’ rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHpEaK"&gt;Adding Riot titles brings games in the hugely popular &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; franchise to the Epic Games Store, and they could see an added boost by being available on Epic’s platform. But I’m not kidding when I say the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; franchise is already huge: Riot shared this week that 180 million players played games set in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; universe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1455172784938651649"&gt;&lt;em&gt;just in October&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kkNu50"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you to our global community for helping Runeterra reach new heights! 180 million players in October and still growing! &lt;a href="https://t.co/7w9goYBeBM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7w9goYBeBM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Riot Games #RiotXArcane   (@riotgames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1455172784938651649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v3PaG0"&gt;That number isn’t exactly what it seems, as Riot is including the mobile hit &lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift &lt;/em&gt;and counting a single person who plays two of its games as two separate players, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/with-180-million-players-league-of-legends-games-have-more-active-users-than-steam/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still a gigantic number of players, though, and Riot is making a big push to grow that number even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S339Ah"&gt;Epic and Riot teamed up on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22760266/league-of-legends-jinx-fortnite-netflix-arcane"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin for the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; character Jinx&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available from the game’s item shop on Thursday. And the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skin and the Riot titles on the Epic Games Store arrive ahead of &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; TV show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688837/netflix-arcane-league-of-legends-trailer-show-riot-games-release-date"&gt;premiering November 6th on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surprise! Facebook’s climate denial problem got worse this year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activists bring iceberg to have it melt in front of the US Capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Thlg23qr0q6Q33EX0BNAZa70vEw=/0x0:6699x4466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094955/1236343298.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z3ZvcR"&gt;As world leaders scramble to forge global agreements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; this month in a last-ditch effort to avert the worst of the climate crisis, there’s a threat to meaningful climate action lurking on social media. Climate denial on Facebook has gotten even worse this year, according to a new &lt;a href="https://stopfundingheat.info/facebook-in-denial/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by climate advocacy group Stop Funding Heat and the Real Facebook Oversight Board, a watchdog group made up of academics, journalists, and activists. It’s evidence that Facebook’s efforts to stomp out lies about climate change are failing, the study’s authors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJd5V2"&gt;Reactions, comments, and shares per post from Facebook pages and groups dedicated to spreading climate misinformation jumped a whopping 77 percent since January, the report found. Each day, it found, climate misinformation on the platform gets between 818,000 and 1.36 million views. Less than 4 percent of the posts it analyzed had been fact-checked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5xRVYJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook is the Big Tobacco of our generation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Ykr2F"&gt;“Facebook is the Big Tobacco of our generation, greenwashing to avoid responsibility and sewing [sic] confusion and doubt about climate change in the global conversation,” Real Facebook Oversight Board wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNcd3p"&gt;The authors analyzed a dataset of 195 pages and groups and 48,700 posts written in English between January and August. That included 41 accounts focused entirely on climate misinformation, like a page called ‘Friends of Science’ that today posted a photo of a cake with icing that says “COP26 Much Ado About Nothing”— a reference to COP26 the high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. Other pages and groups also have a history of posting false information about climate change. Fox News, Breitbart, and Sean Hannity were the three most prolific spreaders of climate misinformation identified in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv5ERZ"&gt;The study also scrutinized advertising on the platform and found 113 instances of Facebook making money from ads pushing climate misinformation. More than three-quarters of the spending came from just seven pages, all of which had previously been flagged in an &lt;a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Change-and-Digital-Advertising-86222daed29c6f49ab2da76b0df15f76#"&gt;October 2020 investigation&lt;/a&gt; of disinformation ads on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxo1At"&gt;“Facebook has been told over and over, through public reports and in private meetings, that its platform is a breeding ground for climate misinformation. Either they don’t care or they don’t know how to fix it,” Sean Buchan, chief researcher for Stop Funding Heat, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kam0a6"&gt;Facing pressure from activists, Facebook launched a “Climate Science Center” last year that shares information, videos, and quizzes about climate change and is now available in more than 100 countries. But environmental activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677376/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-fossil-fuel-advertising"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it’s a paltry effort that doesn’t stop the spread of climate lies in the first place. Facebook says that its Science Center gets more than 100,000 visits daily, far less than the number of views garnered by misleading climate posts analyzed in the new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FsPciO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either they don’t care or they don’t know how to fix it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhovRL"&gt;The company, which recently rebranded itself as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;, has faced even more heat recently with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;massive document leak&lt;/a&gt; that revealed failures to stop harmful content related to everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22754046/facebook-tighter-restrictions-vaccine-misinformation-children"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpNLjf"&gt;The study adds to a steady stream of damning findings on Facebook’s handling of misleading climate information. Earlier this week, a separate &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; traced 69 percent of all interactions with content denying climate change back to just 10 publishers. In September, an &lt;a href="http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Texas_Disinfo_Report_final_v4.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; into misinformation around this year’s &lt;a href="https://windommedia.com/blog/2021/05/27/go-read-this-investigation-into-the-real-death-toll-from-the-texas-freeze-justine-calma/"&gt;deadly cold snap&lt;/a&gt; in Texas found that less than 1 percent of interactions with the “highest-performing” content that falsely blamed wind turbines for blackouts were with posts that carried Facebook’s fact-checking labels. And in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063436369"&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/em&gt; published&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into a de facto loophole for opinion content in Facebook’s fact-checking practices that triggered an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368136/facebook-climate-change-fact-check-senators-warren"&gt;inquiry from Democratic senators&lt;/a&gt;. The company works with independent fact-checkers to review and rate how accurate content is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV8Alz"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the new report uses “flawed methodology” to inflate the number of posts and ads containing climate misinformation. “It’s really just posts these groups disagree with politically,” the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPYwlg"&gt;But while the report authors acknowledge that their definition of climate misinformation included content which has no overt factual inaccuracies but is misleadingly packaged, the report also flagged many outright lies. For example, the study found a quote from botanist and climate denier &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/david-bellamy-obituary"&gt;David Bellamy&lt;/a&gt; that says, “Global warming is part of a natural cycle and there’s nothing we can actually do to stop these cycles.” The quote from 2008, “does not reflect scientific consensus” that &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/"&gt;humans are to blame&lt;/a&gt; for climate change, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/03/viral-image/2008-quote-does-not-reflect-scientific-consensus-h/"&gt;Politifact&lt;/a&gt;, one of the independent fact-checking groups with which Facebook partners. While some Facebook posts sharing the quote have been taken down or labeled as “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/198600623557681/posts/4541752425909124"&gt;false information&lt;/a&gt;,” the viral quote can still be found in other posts without the fact-checking label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yK5vTY"&gt;“Clearly Facebook’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, and its Climate Science Center, has failed,” Buchan said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbp8AX"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji4qUe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSUhRk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Flex drivers will start getting checks for $60 million in withheld tips</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EeD01z"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission will send out more than $60 million to drivers for Amazon’s Flex program, representing tip money that the commission says was illegally withheld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2rVe4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/11/ftc-returns-nearly-60-million-drivers-whose-tips-were-illegally"&gt;According to the official announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC is preparing 139,501 checks and 1,621 PayPal payments to drivers who had more than $5 in withheld tips. The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000, while the average repayment is $422. Nearly 20,000 drivers will receive checks for more than $600, the FTC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSmweo"&gt;Drivers are expected to receive their tips before January 7th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2cn6OU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The highest back payout going to a single driver is more than $28,000”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WHn8N1"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;the FTC sued Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for withholding tips in its Flex program between the years 2016 and 2019. Amazon continued to collect portions of the drivers’ tips up until the government filed its lawsuit outlining the alleged illegal behavior in 2019, according to the FTC’s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABkrRY"&gt;“Rather than passing along 100 percent of customers’ tips to drivers, as it had promised to do, Amazon used the money itself,” said Daniel Kaufman, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqIVrq"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-somehttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some"&gt;Amazon agreed to settle the case&lt;/a&gt; and surrender all of the tip money, totaling more than $60 million, to the FTC. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raka46"&gt;Amazon Flex contracts with individual drivers to deliver packages in their own vehicles, primarily delivering Prime Now and Amazon Fresh goods. In its February lawsuit, the FTC said that customers and drivers were told by Amazon that the drivers would receive 100 percent of any tips paid. This practice ended in 2016 after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;Amazon allegedly lowered the minimum hourly pay&lt;/a&gt; for drivers and made up the difference with their tip money. The FTC said drivers were not notified of this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQgolv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0s8mE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve South’s new Apple Watch sweatband doesn’t work with every watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTIdoD-N7yRTXXZsd_ECb5hiYwQ=/40x0:1510x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094331/Header_Image_Alt_1920x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve South’s new ActionBand for Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twelve South&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CZRMxW"&gt;One of the defining features of the Apple Watch is the vast number of bands you can buy to make it fit your needs and style. That can be particularly useful for workouts. You might not want to wear a leather band during a long run, but you can easily swap in bands made of other materials that can better withstand sweat. If you’ve been looking for a full-on wrist sweatband to use alongside your Apple Watch, though, accessories maker Twelve South now has you covered with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ActionBand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch%3Futm_source%3DKlaviyo%26utm_medium%3Dcampaign-email%26utm_campaign%3DActionBand%2520Apple%2520Watch%2520Launch%2520%25282021-11-04%2529%26utm_content%3DProduct%2520Launch%26_kx%3DWNYk2ScXZZeZl25hceRvBiPt-VjkAjdGEPkerJ_q6N-dP4mjJhn-rRC0jGSKN8OD.MWj2bN&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; for Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PglZr"&gt;The ActionBand is a terry cotton band that sits tight on your wrist and has a frame for you to slot in the watch part of your Apple Watch. The frame is designed in such a way to let you access the Digital Crown and the watch’s side button, so you won’t have to rely entirely on the touchscreen if you need to navigate around your watch while working out. To clean a pair of the sweatbands (when you buy the ActionBand, you get one with an Apple Watch cradle and one without), Twelve South says you can just toss them in the washing machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F0E9BK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQAEPFe7-FU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGnFJA"&gt;While the ActionBand does seem well-designed and comfortable, if you’re not already someone who uses sweatbands, I don’t know if it’s worth picking up. In my experience, Apple’s standard Sport Band is already quite comfortable for long workouts, so switching to a sweatband wouldn’t have a benefit for me there. I’d argue that the Sport Band is easier to clean than the ActionBand; just run it under some water. And if I used the ActionBand while doing yoga, I’d worry that the sweatbands could make poses where I have to grab my wrist more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lN3EIu"&gt;The ActionBand also has a big catch: unlike Apple’s own watch bands, the ActionBand isn’t compatible with every Apple Watch. Right now, only the Apple Watch Series 4, 5, 6, and SE can be slotted into the ActionBand, though Twelve South says Apple Watch Series 7 compatibility is “coming soon.” Unfortunately, the Apple Watch Series 3 isn’t compatible with the ActionBand at all, which presumably means older models with a largely similar design aren’t, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Nig36"&gt;If you are interested in the ActionBand, though, you can pick one up now for $30 from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Factionband-for-apple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22763533%2Fapple-watch-twelve-south-actionband-wrist-sweatband" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Twelve South’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft warns Windows 11 features are failing due to its expired certificate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user types on the Surface Pro 8 from behind. The screen displays the Windows 11 start menu on a white and blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLkkl78LmA1JaVWadijxDFb2jDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094217/bfarsace_211004_4777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pZHyn0"&gt;Microsoft has started warning Windows 11 users that certain features in the operating system are failing to load due to an expired certificate. The certificate expired on October 31st, and Microsoft warns that some Windows 11 users aren’t able to open apps like the Snipping Tool, touch keyboard, or emoji panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imJv8p"&gt;A patch is available to fix some of the issues, but it’s currently in preview, meaning you have to install it manually from Windows Update. The patch, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;KB4006746&lt;/a&gt;, will fix the touch keyboard, voice typing, emoji panel, and issues with the getting started and tips sections of Windows 11. You’ll be able to find this patch by checking for updates in the Windows Update section of Settings in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z84dE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft still needs to fix the Snipping Tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u40ii1"&gt;Microsoft’s patch doesn’t address the problems with the Snipping Tool app, though. “To mitigate the issue with Snipping Tool, use the Print Screen key on your keyboard and paste the screenshot into your document,” &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-21h2#2739msgdesc"&gt;recommends Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “You can also paste it into Paint to select and copy the section you want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFWsMW"&gt;It’s not clear how many Windows 11 users are affected by these issues, and we haven’t been able to replicate the Snipping Tool problems on multiple patched systems. If you are having issues, some &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers have reported being able to change the system date back to October 30th, and then launching Snipping Tool to get it working again. You can then change the system date back once the app has loaded ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJrSqy"&gt;The expired certificate is also causing issues with the accounts page in the settings section of Windows 11 with S mode enabled and the input method editor UI. It’s not clear when the Snipping Tool and S mode issues will be addressed. “We are working on a resolution for Snipping tool and the S mode only issues and will provide an update when more information is available,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siGlD0"&gt;Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 issues come just two weeks after the company had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22732336/microsoft-windows-11-amd-cpu-performance-issues-fix-release"&gt;issue a patch to fix AMD CPU performance in the OS&lt;/a&gt;. A bug was slowing performance on Ryzen processors by up to 15 percent in certain games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnlZ40"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, November 4th 1:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Snipping Tool workaround.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is launching a company that uses AI for drug discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fvTWcIK-44RTqVs2-txzT6ervE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094150/msingleton_180612_2663_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Micah Singleton / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X7ReMi"&gt;A new Alphabet company will use artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery, Google’s parent company &lt;a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/blog"&gt;announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll build off of the work done by DeepMind, another Alphabet subsidiary that has done groundbreaking work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;using AI to predict the structure of proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81Rhb0"&gt;The new company, called Isomorphic Laboratories, will leverage that success to build tools that can help identify new pharmaceuticals. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis will also serve as the CEO for Isomorphic, but the two companies will stay separate and collaborate occasionally, a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mS2A8"&gt;For years, experts have pointed to AI as a way to make it faster and cheaper to find new medications to treat various conditions. AI could help scan through databases of potential molecules to find some that best fit a particular biological target, for example, or to fine-tune proposed compounds. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in companies building AI tools over &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-021-00045-7"&gt;the past two years&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6obUf"&gt;Isomorphic will try to build models that can predict how drugs will interact with the body, Hassabis &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/11/04/alphabet-launches-drug-discovery-company-building-on-deepmind/?utm_content=buffer1a72c&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter_organic"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It could leverage DeepMind’s work on protein structure to figure out how multiple proteins might interact with each other. The company may not develop its own drugs but instead sell its models. It will focus on developing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, a spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIvcw"&gt;Developing and testing drugs, though, could be a steeper challenge than figuring out protein structure. For example, even if two proteins have structures that fit together physically, it’s hard to tell &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-021-00161-0"&gt;how well they’ll actually stick&lt;/a&gt;. A drug candidate that looks promising based on how it works at a chemical level also &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/blogs/the-drug-discoverer/page-details/reflecting-on-deepmind-s-alphafold-artificial-intelligence-success-what-s-the-real-significance-for-protein-folding-research-and-drug-discovery"&gt;might not always work&lt;/a&gt; when it’s given to an animal or a person. Over 90 percent of drugs that make it to a clinical trial end up not working, as chemist and writer Derek Lowe &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-protein-folding-progress---what-s-it-mean"&gt;pointed out in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;this summer&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the problems aren’t because there was something wrong at the molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43Kgc7"&gt;The work done at DeepMind and the proposed work at Isomorphic could help bust through some research bottlenecks but aren’t a quick fix for the the countless challenges of drug development. “The laborious, resource-draining work of doing the biochemistry and biological evaluation of, for example, drug functions” will remain, as Helen Walden, a professor of structural biology at the University of Glasgow, previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586578/deepmind-alphafold-ai-protein-folding-human-proteome-released-for-free"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square is letting the teens use Cash App</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilG83eC4cQslWnp2eT1FnlsKHpI=/329x0:2321x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70094118/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_18.29.40.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Cash App&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0PF6tG"&gt;Square &lt;a href="https://cash.app/13+"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that people over 13 years old can use Cash App to deposit and spend money or send it to friends. The app was previously only available to people aged 18 or older, and while minors will have to get their parent or guardians’ permission to use the app (and that parent-figure will have significant oversight), they’ll still be able to use some of the app’s most popular features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic8Dyc"&gt;Teens won’t be able to do just &lt;em&gt;anything &lt;/em&gt;with Cash App, though — they won’t have access to the investing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1455944391604850689"&gt;or Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; features, despite Jack Dorsey’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617551/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-unite-country-world-peace-cryptocurrency"&gt;passion for crypto&lt;/a&gt;, and Square says they won’t be able to deposit checks. That last one really feels like a missed trick, as I remember getting a lot of checks as gifts or payments for odd jobs as a teen. However, the app will give them access to the peer-to-peer transactions that made the app famous, as well as a customizable debit card they can use at real-life locations and support for Apple and Google Pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CGHQcp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not yet...&lt;/p&gt;— jack⚡️ (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1455944391604850689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LafSOl"&gt;One of Square’s biggest competitors, Venmo, doesn’t allow people under 18 to use its service, though it’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/venmo-teen-debit-card/"&gt;reportedly testing a similar teen-oriented debit card&lt;/a&gt;. Cash App is far from the first to offer online banking or payment services to 13-year-olds, though: &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211324"&gt;Apple Cash has a family option&lt;/a&gt; that you can use with Apple Pay (though there’s no physical debit card option), and there are a host of online banks that offer checking accounts to teens, complete with parental supervision. Child accounts are also often &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/teen-checking-accounts"&gt;offered by more traditional banks&lt;/a&gt; and credit unions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV9dSM"&gt;Still, Cash App’s popularity (especially on Twitter, also founded by Jack Dorsey) could help make it the choice for teens. Of course, teens aren’t the only people Square has to convince — minors still need their parent or guardian’s permission to use Cash App. After they get it, the parent or guardian will &lt;a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6486-authorized-users-under-18"&gt;technically be the legal owner of the account&lt;/a&gt; (the teen will be an authorized user), and they’ll be able to see any transactions made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cBNlyf"&gt;The two companies planned to light up new 5G networks that use so-called “C-band” frequencies on December 5th. That rollout will now be delayed until at least January 5th, the companies said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQLr73"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T still currently offer ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies. But the two companies have been banking on using the C-band — which covers midrange frequencies with good-to-great speed — to dramatically expand access to 5G across the country. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;collectively spent nearly $70 billion earlier this year to gain access to a bunch of C-band spectrum&lt;/a&gt; that was up for auction. T-Mobile, the other major player in the wireless market, already has a lot of mid-band spectrum that doesn’t operate in the C-band (though it will in a few years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="inoXgW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T need this spectrum to keep pace with T-Mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k7AlJO"&gt;The aviation industry has voiced concerns over C-band interference for a while now. In an &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;August meeting&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Communications Commission, for instance, industry reps said that “major disruptions to use of the National Airspace System can be expected” with the rollout of C-band 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDKp1g"&gt;Those concerns &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-faa-warns-potential-interference-new-5g-technology-2021-11-02/"&gt;came to a head this week&lt;/a&gt; when the FAA released a “&lt;a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/(LookupSAIBs)/AIR-21-18?OpenDocument"&gt;special information bulletin&lt;/a&gt;” about potential interference issues with safety equipment that relies on radio altimeters. While the agency said that there have been no documented incidents of “harmful interference” in other countries to date, it nonetheless warned aircraft operators that they “should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5QOcq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said Thursday that it is working with the FAA and FCC to better understand the aviation industry’s concerns. “It is critical that these discussions be informed by the science and the data,” the company said in a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “That is the only path to enabling experts and engineers to assess whether any legitimate co-existence issues exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfFHfJ"&gt;The major wireless trade group, the CTIA, said last week that companies should be able to use C-band 5G “without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-has-deep-concern-about-5g-network-plan-aviation-safety-letter-2021-10-29/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The group pointed to the many successful C-band deployments in other countries as evidence. “Any delay in activating this spectrum risks America’s competitiveness,” the group wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
