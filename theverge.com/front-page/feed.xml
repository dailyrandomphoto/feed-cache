  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DsiiFD"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a brilliant gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop for video editing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HfyKBe"&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly is a great business laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kanye West’s new Donda Stem Player will apparently let you ‘customize any song’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1mpUXDLc66m0xLthQiZTj_EHrug=/5x0:635x420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774596/Aug_25_2021_08_45_35.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CrosY"&gt;Kanye West revealed a new music gadget called the Donda Stem Player that will let you “customize any song,” &lt;a href="http://STEMPLAYER.COM"&gt;according to the device’s website&lt;/a&gt;. It’s available for preorder now for $200 with a vague “summer” release date, though the website says it will ship “with Donda,” West’s upcoming album. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbddcT"&gt;Let’s get some of the gadget-y stuff out of the way first. The device, which West’s Yeezy Tech brand developed with &lt;a href="https://kano.me/us"&gt;electronics company Kano&lt;/a&gt;, looks like a little tan puck, and it’s apparently made of a “soft silicone blended skin.” It’s equipped with a headphone jack and Bluetooth support (and can do simultaneous Bluetooth and audio jack playback), a USB-C port, volume buttons, speakers, a haptic engine, and 8GB of storage. The four light bars are “touch sensitive light sliders,” which presumably let you control the device to customize songs. And it supports a wide range of music formats: .AIFF, .AIF, .FLAC, .M4A, .MP3, .WAV, .WAVE, .AAC, .ALAC, and .MP4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e_xpnBTX5a5Y1GPy_3sWbdaOfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804843/Aug_25_2021_08_45_35.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7su29M"&gt;As for what you can actually do with the Donda Stem Player, the website says you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1yYr"&gt;Control vocals, drums, bass, and samples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iKN4c"&gt;Isolate parts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0SRH4"&gt;Add effects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EMTQc"&gt;Split any song into stems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PXFs50"&gt;The site also says it offers the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dyz3qL"&gt;4-channel lossless audio mixing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJbPOw"&gt;Realtime loop and speed control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4nX0S"&gt;Tactile effects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYzFyF"&gt;One hits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2airE"&gt;Live samples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9TEmj"&gt;Save, playback, and share mixes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCTTdN"&gt;Customize colors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHXL7U"&gt;Content and software updates from your browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="APv7Qo"&gt;It seems like the Donda Stem Player could be a powerful music creation tool packed into a tiny device, and it’s one that’s been rumored for a while: an alleged prototype of another West-affiliated stem player &lt;a href="https://lindynews.org/10131/entertainment/new-kanye-west-stem-players-leaked-online/"&gt;surfaced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WestSubEver/status/1377131400436928515"&gt;leaked promotional video posted in March&lt;/a&gt; seemingly showed off the device announced on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NeZYKf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;News*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new video has emerged of the Yeezy Tech x Kano Stem Player. We promise it's real this time  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think of the device  ❓ &lt;a href="https://t.co/jbIUkQN79R"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jbIUkQN79R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— West Sub Ever (@WestSubEver) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WestSubEver/status/1377131400436928515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n5OpDx"&gt;But without trying it out for ourselves, we just don’t know how easy it will be to customize “any song,” as promised. If you’re on the fence, you might want to wait for reviews until you buy one for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQ6WxX"&gt;The announcement of the Donda Stem Player arrives as West has spent weeks promoting &lt;em&gt;Donda&lt;/em&gt;, which is currently has an August 29th release date on the iTunes Store. He’s already hosted two stadium listening parties for the album, and he will be hosting a third &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/8/24/22640219/kanye-west-donda-soldier-field-no-proof-of-vax-negative-covid-tests"&gt;on Thursday at Soldier Field&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago. Fans won’t be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to gain entry, &lt;a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/8/24/22640219/kanye-west-donda-soldier-field-no-proof-of-vax-negative-covid-tests"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Like the previous two events, the show will be livestreamed on Apple Music, &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9616438/kanye-west-announces-third-donda-event-chicago/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTTUkG"&gt;On Tuesday, West filed court documents asking to legally change his name to Ye, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-arts-and-entertainment-courts-hip-hop-and-rap-2322f3f9f8b118334e3eb4149de4010f"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A judge will have to approve the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuUqX7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JFA9O7"&gt;As people ventured out from their pandemic cocoons this year, they gobbled up more electricity than they did before COVID-19 shut the world down. But there still isn’t enough clean energy to meet rising demand, so coal is making a comeback. Global electricity demand climbed 5 percent above pre-pandemic levels in the first six months of 2021, according to an &lt;a href="https://ember-climate.org/project/global-electricity-review-h1-2021/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; published today by London think tank Ember. Electricity grids turned to more coal to meet that demand, and power sector carbon pollution rose 5 percent compared to the first half of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="c08SO1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are building back badly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JZJoJL"&gt;“Catapulting emissions in 2021 should send alarm bells across the world. We are not building back better, we are building back badly,” Dave Jones, global program lead at Ember, said in a statement today. “The electricity transition is happening but with little urgency: emissions are going in the wrong direction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rukuWc"&gt;China drove 90 percent of the rise in electricity demand and most of the uptick in coal. While China is already the biggest carbon emitter in the world, that’s been mitigated by the fact that its &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions"&gt;per capita emissions&lt;/a&gt; are less than half that of the US, which is currently the second biggest climate polluter. But China’s per capita electricity demand is also rising rapidly,  Ember’s report shows. That highlights how important it will be for the planet for China to get its emissions in check. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKDQ3p"&gt;None of the 63 countries Ember analyzed, which account for 87 percent of the global electricity production, saw a “green recovery” in the first half of 2021. Ember’s criteria for “green recovery” included lower power sector emissions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; higher electricity demand, a sign that more electricity was being generated by clean energy sources like solar and wind. Some countries like the US had slightly cleaner power sectors compared to 2019 as electricity demand stayed relatively flat, but their emissions are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;expected to rise again with demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1psVwg"&gt;Renewable energy did have a growth spurt in the early part of 2021. Together, wind and solar generated more than a tenth of the world’s electricity — doubling their share in 2015 and surpassing nuclear power plants for the first time this year. But solar panels and wind turbines were still only able to meet 57 percent of the rise in electricity demand, leaving coal — the dirtiest-burning fossil fuel — to provide the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KmWOPI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A clean power sector is one of the most crucial steps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QIEGWP"&gt;A clean power sector is one of the most crucial steps to achieving global climate goals. Countries are working together under the framework of the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to about 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures, which could significantly limit the damage we’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;already beginning to see&lt;/a&gt; as a result of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGQZIC"&gt;Planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector need to fall by 57 percent this decade to meet that goal, regardless of a rise in electricity demand, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the International Energy Agency. Much of that reduction could come from completely cutting out coal — but the Ember analysis shows that the opposite is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BlQCm"&gt;In the future, clean power grids could also translate to clean transportation, housing, and building sectors. All-electric vehicles, homes, and buildings are one way city planners and policymakers have sought to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. But the power sector has a long way to go to provide them all with carbon pollution-free energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxRnCL"&gt;During the height of the pandemic last year, carbon dioxide emissions fell across the board for electricity, transportation, and other energy-hungry industries. That clearly hasn’t been enough to stave off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;climate change-fueled disasters&lt;/a&gt; like worsening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;droughts&lt;/a&gt;, explosive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22612874/wildfires-worse-night-hot-dry-california-us-west"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, record-smashing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;heatwaves&lt;/a&gt;, and severe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22607996/flood-risk-satellite-data-nature-study"&gt;storms&lt;/a&gt;. Moving forward, CO2 cuts will have to come from intentional changes to how the world does business — not because a pandemic put things on pause.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controversial crypto rules remain in infrastructure bill after House vote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LyeQOZPp5QTdI7qw2hQ9dvaMsIc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774393/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y0fJ9o"&gt;Controversial new cryptocurrency tax requirements are likely to become law through the bipartisan infrastructure bill. The cryptocurrency community rallied to fix the language, but the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/amid-turmoil-democrats-delay-house-vote-infrastructure-budget-bills-n1277516"&gt;House voted to proceed&lt;/a&gt; with the bill as is on Tuesday, moving forward without any new amendments or opportunities to change it.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETvE60"&gt;On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and a group of moderate Democrats reached a deal to approve a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, schedule floor action on the bipartisan infrastructure deal by September 27th, and advance voting rights legislation. The agreement comes after a group of moderate Democrats pledged to vote down the multitrillion-dollar social safety net package if it was approved before the bipartisan infrastructure bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ONRR0Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re disappointed but not surprised”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOV2cG"&gt;However, the deal also prohibits any new amendments from being considered to the infrastructure package unless the House approves a new rule that would allow them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cBcGK"&gt;The deal strikes a devastating blow to the cryptocurrency community that spent the last few weeks working to remove language from the infrastructure package that could extend burdensome tax reporting requirements to wallet developers and miners. Several amendments were proposed in the Senate earlier this month, but they ultimately failed, leaving the problematic language in the final bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEt0Bo"&gt;“We’re disappointed but not surprised,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center communications director, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It was always a long shot. That said, we have opportunities over the coming months to get this fixed in legislation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNxWVr"&gt;Several House lawmakers, like Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Anna Eshoo (D-CA), opposed the bill’s broad definition of “broker” and the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus sent a letter to members of Congress calling for a fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY5Roh"&gt;Still, cryptocurrency advocates may have a chance to influence how the rules are applied. The Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/house-moves-to-consider-unamended-infrastructure-bill"&gt;has reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that it would issue new guidance on the rules once they’re passed, ensuring that it would provide exemptions to firms that do not operate as brokers. But it’s unclear if Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would support more industry-friendly rules. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/yellen-sounds-warning-about-extremely-inefficient-bitcoin.html"&gt;In an interview with CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year, Yellen called Bitcoin an “extremely inefficient” asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FXuocG"&gt;She continued, “It is a highly speculative asset and you know I think people should be aware it can be extremely volatile and I do worry about potential losses that investors can suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKCuOO"&gt;The Treasury Department has sought to calm cryptocurrency advocates, telling reporters that it would not interpret the “broker” language as including miners or developers. Still, many cryptocurrency advocates argue that the promise is not enough and that future administrations could reinterpret the bill’s underlying definition more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coqtvP"&gt;“I appreciate that it seems to be Treasury’s intention to get this right, and we look forward to engaging in any regulatory process in the years to come,” Jerry Brito, Coin Center executive director, said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1430234583572832257?s=20"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. “But please don’t accept the narrative that folks in crypto are overreacting about this provision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4W3F7f"&gt;As the House moves forward on the infrastructure package, national security officials are raising the alarm that the cryptocurrency language could force illicit cryptocurrency transactions underground, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/infrastructure-bills-cryptocurrency-measures-risk-pushing-criminals-further-underground-11629883800"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Wednesday. More regulation could “push illicit use and criminal actors deeper into anonymizing methods and corners of the internet that would make it more difficult for law enforcement,” Jeremy Sheridan, US Secret Service investigations office assistant director, told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;.     &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are available from Walmart (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 25th, 1:06PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Walmart appears to have sold out of the Xbox Series X and both iterations of the PS5 for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPXyjm"&gt;Walmart is offering gamers a chance to get a PS5 and Xbox Series X today, Wednesday, August 25th, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. That’s when the first wave of consoles will be made available, but the retailer has been known to release a few consecutive waves every ten minutes (12:10PM, 12:20PM, etc.) As always, try to sign in before things get started and enter your address and payment info to make the checkout process as speedy as possible. You may have better luck getting a console if you load up the site, and simultaneously have the page open within Walmart’s mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCxCfF"&gt;If you’re searching for the Sony PS5, Walmart has &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $499.99 version&lt;/a&gt; that has a Blu-ray disc drive for game discs and movies, as well as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the $399.99 digital version&lt;/a&gt; that lacks a disc drive and, as a result, is cheaper and a bit lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z49lVf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="b7gFNX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="0tUI1W"&gt;Whether you’d rather have an Xbox Series X, or heck, you’re trying your luck at getting two consoles today, Walmart will have it in stock at 12PM ET alongside the PS5. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F141335186&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This model costs $499.99&lt;/a&gt; and, like the PS5, it features a Blu-ray drive for game discs and movies. It also features a larger 1TB SSD compared to the Series S that ships with 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AM19yE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKVPrQ"&gt;We recommend picking up a second controller while you’re at it, like this &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-Shock-Blue%2F265882360%3FfindingMethod%3Dwpa&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shock blue-colored wireless model&lt;/a&gt; that costs $59. Otherwise, your next purchase should be an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which gives you instant access to download a dizzying amount of games. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;New subscribers can get their first month for just $1&lt;/a&gt;, then it’s $14.99 per month to get online multiplayer, as well as access to Game Pass on both PC and console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60P10G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;A solid wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt; might also be something that’ll make your time gaming more enjoyable. Good luck today!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s ‘Tudum’ fan event will bring trailers, interviews, and announcements for its originals on September 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/La3pqAs8_J8YujDfx4nkTlW_zHU=/197x0:2201x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773698/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_10.17.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JoKu4R"&gt;Netflix is hosting its own online fan event for the first time on September 25h. The event is called “&lt;a href="https://www.tudum.com/?lang=en"&gt;Tudum&lt;/a&gt;” (as in the onomatopoeia of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV3HUDMQ-F8"&gt;Netflix’s iconic logo sound&lt;/a&gt;), and promises an “exciting day full of exclusives and first looks,” for some of its most popular series and movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQOJZG"&gt;The three-hour event (which starts at 12PM ET) will include “breaking news and ... first looks, new trailers and exclusive clips during interactive panels and conversations with the creators and stars from Netflix,” and feature over 70 shows and movies on Netflix, including &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Old Guard&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Umbrella Academy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rAetFs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0aoURo_eMI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OFiuxE"&gt;Additionally, Netflix will be hosting three pre-show events before the main stream starting at 8AM ET: one for Korean series and films, one for Indian movies and shows, and one for anime content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzNk9t"&gt;The shift toward major, branded fan events like this has started to become increasingly common, helped along by the uptick in online events caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Events like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399490/dcs-fandome-virtual-event-convention-digital-batman-justice-league-film-gaming"&gt;DC’s FanDome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465657/netflix-geeked-week-how-to-watch"&gt;Netflix’s Geeked Week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1263077012299628545"&gt;Disney Plus’ National Streaming Day programming&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570627/the-witcher-season-two-teaser-trailer-netflix-henry-cavill"&gt;livestreamed WitcherCon event&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly becoming the home for the kinds of creator and cast interviews, trailer reveals, and announcements that would have been commonplace at events like San Diego Comic-Con. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViD7Bd"&gt;Tudum marks the latest move in that direction; after all, with Netflix already offering so much content, why would it want to risk sharing the stage when it has enough news and trailers to fuel an entire event just for its own shows and movies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKju9P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to remove (but not delete) unneeded Google contacts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pOC2zmwnQESflY6HUe54ro0zMXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773668/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MTu3gm"&gt;My friend (and occasional writer for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.androidintel.net/about/#jr"&gt;JR Raphael&lt;/a&gt; has a newsletter in which he recently wrote about cleaning up your Google Contacts list by deleting old and no-longer-wanted entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A92iBc"&gt;What a good idea, I thought. But. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRztD1"&gt;Unfortunately, I am something of a hoarder when it comes to contacts. After years as a tech journalist, I have who-knows-how-many business contact listings, many of which are completely out of date. But although it’s likely that a lot of these people have moved to different companies and different email addresses, I feel I should keep the entries — what if I come across them at some point and want to check where I knew them from? Or what if they still work there even though it’s been several years and I want to say hi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2bcJT4"&gt;There is another reason that I am reluctant to delete certain contacts — an unfortunate one. As the years go by, my contact list has begun to include friends and relatives who are no longer with us — and I find that I am loath to remove those names from my list. It’s not logical, or reasonable, but to me it feels like a sort of rejection. In 2015, in an article titled “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/opinion/sunday/my-digital-cemetery.html"&gt;My Digital Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; writer Rob Walker expressed it this way: “The convenient-by-design act of deleting the name of a dead friend with a simple tap or click can feel like overtly participating in removing that person from the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPxDWY"&gt;The result of all this is a Google contacts list that has several hundred names in it, many of which belong to people I haven’t contacted in a long time, or whose entries I simply don’t want to delete. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJA5PN"&gt;I’ve found a couple of ways to bring some order to Google Contacts without permanently losing the names, numbers, and other information from people. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CjtTac"&gt;Hide your excess contacts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MMYkRd"&gt;Google has a weird way of getting names off your main contact list: you “hide” them. I put “hide” in quotes because what you are essentially doing is moving that entry from your main contacts list to an “Other contacts” list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bl7Je4"&gt;“Other contacts” contains entries from all the various people to whom you’ve sent emails or from whom you’ve received them. For that reason, it can be a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; list — but since it isn’t usually in view, if you move your older contacts there, they won’t clutter up your main contacts list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qA7dRB"&gt;You can find your “Other contacts” on &lt;a href="https://contacts.google.com/"&gt;the desktop version of Google Contacts&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the left-hand list of labels. (On the mobile version of Contacts, you can’t see your “Other contacts” list, but if you search for a specific contact who is in that list, they will come up in that search.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FCgXf"&gt;Here’s how to move one or more contacts to the “Other contacts” list using the Google Contacts web app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Xyqm4o"&gt;Hide a single contact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="40Qdhz"&gt;Cursor over the contact listing so that it’s highlighted, then click on the three dots to the right of the entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WZkWJL"&gt;Select “Hide from contacts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Hide from contacts” will put an entry in the “Other contacts” list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MkDoo2lSy8eV6LW_6qJ4x_kPTtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803255/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_3.29.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hide from contacts” will put an entry in the “Other contacts” list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7CsxK"&gt;Hide several contacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8mIy90"&gt;Click the icon for each contact you want to hide; the icon will turn into a checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZVcqK"&gt;When you’ve selected all the contacts you want to hide, click on the three dots at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="99Jzq4"&gt;Click on “Hide from contacts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To hide several entries, check them off and click on the label icon above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uBSU0NknyKUZweIdneMwamLVy9U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803257/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_3.29.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To hide several entries, check them off and click on the label icon above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8gtNyb"&gt;Incidentally, if your “Other contacts” list is in itself too unwieldy, you can stop Gmail from adding names to it every time you send or receive an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s4FkMe"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TGjOho"&gt;In the “General” tab, scroll down to “Create contacts for auto-complete:” and check “I’ll add contacts myself.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WtyIeG"&gt;Export and delete your excess contacts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jNsZYg"&gt;If you want to really clean up your contacts list, but don’t want to lose the info for those contacts, you can export them into a separate CSV or vCard file. Once they’re safely stored, you can delete them from your Google contacts list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qcV10"&gt;If you’re like me, you probably have more excess contacts than you want to deal with in one sitting. So here’s the way I found to handle it. (Again, this is using the web interface for Google Contacts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1Cn5Zz"&gt;In the left-hand column, scroll down to and click on “Create label.” Choose a suitable name (I named mine “Bye bye”).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Create a label to identify the contacts you want to export." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxqdr68FaT3N5Pok0prG7WRuQUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803220/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_4.00.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create a label to identify the contacts you want to export.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="DZJtoa"&gt;Spend as much time as you need going through your contacts list. Add that label to any entry that you want to move out of the list. The fastest way is to check off any entries you want to label, click on the label symbol above, select the label you created for this purpose from the pop-up, and then click on “Apply.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you haven’t culled your contacts list for a while, you may have a lot of entries to label." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJon9P4utwmhyZ-t-eNjJaewOFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803227/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_4.17.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you haven’t culled your contacts list for a while, you may have a lot of entries to label.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NMEsge"&gt;When you’re ready to export everything you’ve put under that label, click on the label on the left side of the app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aJeFHY"&gt;Scroll down the same left-hand column and click on “Export.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can export your contacts as part of a CSV file or as vCards." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkvTTNirfe4BFYy6aJiP6ta7vxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803229/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_4.23.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can export your contacts as part of a CSV file or as vCards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IdVkMx"&gt;The label that you chose should be at the top of the pop-up window. If it isn’t, you can click on the small arrow to the right of the label and select the correct one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lf28oc"&gt;You can export your contacts as CSV files formatted for either Google or Microsoft Outlook, or as iCards (if you are importing to iOS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1bZexi"&gt;Once you’ve got CSV or iCards files, import them into a spreadsheet or other app where you can have access to them if you need to. For example, I imported mine into a Google Sheets file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iMIRPM"&gt;Once you’re happy with your export, go back to Google Contacts and click on the label you created for your exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ll3vhO"&gt;Click on the delete button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once they’ve been exported, you can delete all your excess contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dh_sSy64QTLQ5YwZDpfqvdpV9r0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22803233/Screen_Shot_2021_08_24_at_11.51.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once they’ve been exported, you can delete all your excess contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="eQQZPp"&gt;You have a choice to delete just the label (in which case, all those entries will still be there) or delete both the label and all entries that have the label. Select the latter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="M1yWVh"&gt;Now you have cleaned up (at least somewhat) your contacts list — and all the contacts that you still wanted to hold onto are safe and secure in another file where you can find them if you ever need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J24Rx9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52Uoh3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Best Buy stores will have Nvidia RTX 30-series GPUs available tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F0mOZtCg6t48LqyNszLtbwcbHmM=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773568/twarren_20210601_4611_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W2PB3g"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics cards are next to impossible to find in stock, but Best Buy is offering PC gamers an opportunity to buy one on Thursday, August 26th. Select store locations will have stock, and if you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750089234402385290" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;find your local store on this page&lt;/a&gt; by using the drop-down options, it’ll be among the locations getting some GPUs for Thursday’s restock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cdHtS"&gt;You can’t just show up at any time of the day and pick one up. In order to be eligible to buy one, you’ll need to arrive at your store before 7:30AM local time and queue up. That’s the time when Best Buy employees will give one ticket to each person in line until there are no more tickets. If you get a ticket, Best Buy says it guarantees that you can purchase one graphics card, so be early to ensure you get a ticket and that you can get the GPU you want. If you miss out this time, Best Buy seems to do these restock events every month or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD5Wjy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/a-massive-restock-of-nvidia-rtx-30-series-gpus-is-happening-at-best-buy-tomorrow/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GPURestock/status/1430292215365050372" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@GPURestock&lt;/a&gt; claims to have internal information that lays out the exact GPU models that will be available at each of the participating Best Buy locations, and how many each will have on hand. However, some replies to the tweet linked above dispute that the information is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fom2G"&gt;So, just arrive as early as you can and there’s a decent chance that you’ll get the graphics card you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest August Wi-Fi Smart Lock is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An August Wi-Fi Smart Lock being used to lock the door." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOhWdGMo9pQ0UU9fAFAzCeClcpY=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773450/August_Wi_Fi_Smart_Lock_Silver_trex5942_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The latest version of August’s lock is smaller and more discreet.  | Photo: August&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Dc1F4p"&gt;August’s latest Wi-Fi Smart Lock is on a special discount today through &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Faugust%2Dsmart%2Dlock%2Dwi%2Dfi%2D4th%2Dgen&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeDailyDeal082521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;. This small, discreet smart lock is on sale in both black and gray colorways for $199, and you can use promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE20&lt;/strong&gt; to take an additional $20 off the sale price while supplies last. This brings the Alexa-enabled August lock down to a new historic low price of $179, which is an exceptional deal for an app-connected smart lock that can be easily retrofitted to your existing deadbolt without the need for a locksmith. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WlwTdO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9758101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IU4NYr"&gt;Continuing our run of great smart home deals, the Eufy Wi-Fi Video Doorbell 2K is at its all-time low price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R3WY95C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This wired doorbell is great if you’re looking to step into the smart home waters without diving too deep into your wallet, as it does not need a monthly subscription of any kind. The Alexa-ready Eufy also records 2560 x 1920 resolution video and provides some basics that other companies often charge for, including notifications and prerecorded responses, rendering it a great entry-level device. It’s currently on sale for $110, but after you clip the on-page coupon, the price sinks to $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0pCPyF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10717224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xDRnPr"&gt;One of the best deals on the newest pieces of tech has made a return. &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13527013?sid=vergedailydeals082521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot once again&lt;/a&gt; has the recently-released Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 for $25 off. You have all the color options of white, graphite, olive, and lavender available to choose from for $125. The only caveat to keep in mind is that these have a 90-day warranty from Woot in lieu of a warranty directly from Samsung. This is a great value for active noise-canceling earbuds — the Galaxy Buds 2 offer great sound, wireless charging, and ANC in a discreet package — and you rarely get the chance for a nice discount on gear that just dropped.  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l5JII8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1nxzXr"&gt;If you’re looking for a cheap tablet, Amazon’s recently released Fire HD 10 is available right now as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet-productivity-bundle/dp/B08XMBMW3H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a Bluetooth keyboard case and a 12-month subscription to Microsoft Office 365. This effectively gives you the keyboard case and Office 365 subscription for just $20 over what the ad-supported, 32GB base tablet would normally cost, regardless of which of the four colorways you choose. It’s not exactly a productivity powerhouse — for an inexpensive alternative, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;we suggest a Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; for most people — but it is a viable option if you want to stream movies or do some light work with Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22578620/amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-productivity-bundle-kids-pro-2021-tablet-review-which-to-buy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NLj6la"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IDI0qd"&gt;In addition to being the pack-in controller for the Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox controllers have for years been the de facto standard for PC gaming thanks to native support in Windows 10. Thankfully, if you don’t have one or would like to pick up a second controller, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal082521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%2F8xn59crbsqgz%2FHG3Q" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft is selling&lt;/a&gt; the latest iteration of its wireless controller in carbon black for $10 off. For those that prefer splashes of color, Microsoft is also offering the vibrant “shock blue” and “pulse red” models, both of which are currently going for $5 off. In addition to support for Xbox consoles, these controllers support Bluetooth as well as wired connections via USB-C, and the hybrid D-pad is satisfyingly clicky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XmIxrT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are some must-have accessories for your Xbox Series X or Series S","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550830/xbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="E8tzb4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10654449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RQjnQB"&gt;If you rank the visual performance of your video games over counting pixels, the LG UltraGear 27GN750-B might be the ideal display in this price range. With a 240Hz IPS panel and 1920 x 1080 resolution, not to mention 1ms response time and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, you can experience incredibly fast, smooth graphics that are devoid of distracting screen tearing. Luckily, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-27GN750-B-Compatibility-Adjustable/dp/B0841787BZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is offering&lt;/a&gt; a $123 discount on the 27-inch monitor today, dropping it to an all-time low of $277. Both PC and console gamers can jump in, too, as the monitor features dual HDMI ports to complement its DisplayPort connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhjqSq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10717207"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGgESu"&gt;Now if you are the type that believes the more pixels the merrier, the 2560 x 1440 resolution sibling to this monitor from LG is also on a great deal. You get many of the same features like 1ms response time, a similar port selection, and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility with just a small sacrifice of 144Hz refresh rate in exchange for that higher QHD pixel count — all for about $21 more on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-27GN750-B-Compatibility-Adjustable/dp/B08LLD2QXJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s drone delivery service Wing hits 100,000 deliveries milestone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZZndyEoAqxwUSc_29hcmDsVw9c=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773369/72699748_556579681764775_2732760482103427072_n.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Z6zwh"&gt;Wing, the drone delivery company operated by Google-parent Alphabet, is about to rack up 100,000 deliveries. The company says it will pass the threshold in the next few days, a significant milestone for a technology that has nevertheless yet to prove its utility at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLdnoz"&gt;Drone deliveries began to catch the public imagination in the early 2010s as consumer quadcopters fell in price and AI control systems became more reliable. Then, in 2013, Amazon made wild promises about making drones a standard part of its delivery empire. But so far the technology has mainly found success at a much smaller scale: delivering high-value but physically small items like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320965/drone-delivery-vaccine-ghana-zipline-cold-chain-storage"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11367274/zipline-drone-delivery-rwanda-medicine-blood"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; in remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcvDiq"&gt;Wing’s success, though, hints that one future for drone deliveries might lie in the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UmN4Co"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more than 50,000 Wing deliveries have been made in Logan, Australia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lZfpVt"&gt;Wing currently operates in three countries: Australia, the US, and Finland. Its biggest success has been in Logan, Australia: a suburb of Brisbane where more than 50,000 of its total deliveries have been carried out. Logan is home to around 300,000 residents, and Wing’s service is accessible to just over a third of this population. Users can download the Wing app and order a &lt;a href="https://wing.com/australia/logan/"&gt;small selection of goods&lt;/a&gt;, including coffee, groceries, sushi, cakes, pet food, and sportswear. Deliveries are generally made in under 10 minutes, and Wing’s record for a delivery is two minutes and 47 seconds from order to arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MalrvdN5EmZB0r6rr-9z-9w1KQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804334/218633662_999311547491584_4329620671312615629_n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A fleet of Wing delivery drones perform autonomy tests first thing in the morning&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qU8dxk"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;via email, Wing spokesperson Jonathan Bass said Wing’s expansion in Logan shows that the company “can build a safe, scalable service that communities will embrace.” Said Bass: “There are hundreds of cities around the world just like Logan in terms of size: New Orleans, USA; Manchester, England or Florence, Italy, just to name a few.” He noted that more than 2 billion people live in cities with populations of 500,000 or fewer, though he also added that Wing has ambitions to operate in larger cities, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf5YmF"&gt;Part of the reason for Wing’s success seems to be the specifics of its design. Wing’s drones can operate as both fixed-wing aircraft and hovering copters. Unlike Amazon’s delivery drones, the aircraft also don’t need to land to drop off goods. Wing’s craft fly to their location, descend to a height of seven meters (23 feet), and then lower their packages on a tether, automatically releasing them onto the ground. A recent report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air"&gt;about Amazon’s struggling delivery drone program&lt;/a&gt; in the UK identified the need for the company’s drones to physically land on the ground as a major engineering challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/El0e3MCquXDXiN4v9P_iZQqRy2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804325/120200849_809350503154357_8323104168818065800_n.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing’s drones lower their packages down to the ground on a tether. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KgQRVp"&gt;All drone delivery methods, though, limit the technology’s customer base. In densely populated urban areas, customers are unlikely to be able to locate a suitable delivery location at their house. Wing users, for example, need to find “small areas without overhanging trees, power lines or other obstacles, typically in the front yard, backyard or driveway” to receive a delivery, says Bass. These are in short supply for many city residents, including those of Florence, Italy — one of the locations Bass himself mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO4s70"&gt;It’s also not clear if the economics of drone deliveries will make sense at a larger scale. Bass says he’s “extremely bullish” about the potential profitability of Wing, and that drone delivery is “significantly less expensive to scale than existing ground-based delivery methods,” but such claims need to be proven through growth and profits. For the moment, drone delivery is still a fledgling technology, but it might be growing up soon. &lt;/p&gt;
