    <title>You can now run Windows 10 on Arm on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJirpl"&gt;Parallels is releasing an update to its Desktop virtual machine software that allows M1 Mac owners to install Windows 10 on Arm. Parallels Desktop 16.5 now includes the necessary native support to run the Arm version of Windows on M1 chips, following Apple’s decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;not to support Boot Camp on M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9rHvi"&gt;The latest version of Parallels Desktop for Mac now allows M1 Mac owners to run Windows 10 on Arm apps or traditional x86 apps side by side with Mac or iOS apps on Big Sur. There will be some app limitations on the Windows 10 on Arm side, thanks to its own app emulation, but Windows 10 on Arm will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495510/microsoft-windows-on-arm-x64-app-emulation"&gt;soon support x64 app emulation&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkq3JKuRChX6A7m9w4MhsGJWJLA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443416/windowsonmacm1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10 running on an M1 MacBook Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9kPZ5"&gt;Parallels Desktop maker Corel says its latest update also results in some impressive performance and battery improvements over running the software on Intel-based Macs. According to Corel, the 16.5 update uses up to 250 percent less energy on an M1 Mac, compared to an Intel-based MacBook Air. There’s also a promise of up to 60 percent better DirectX 11 performance and up to 30 percent better overall virtual machine performance running the Arm version of Windows 10 on an M1 Mac instead of a Windows 10 VM on an Intel-based MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkhMJY"&gt;The main drawback is that you’ll need to run a preview version of Windows to make this all work. Microsoft only currently licenses the Arm version of Windows 10 to PC makers, so there’s no official way to buy a copy yet. The software maker does provide a Windows 10 on Arm preview build, which can be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2FwindowsinsiderpreviewARM64" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;downloaded from Microsoft’s Windows Insider website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfoBvI"&gt;Alongside the Windows 10 on Arm support, Parallels Desktop 16.5 for Mac also supports Linux distros like Ubuntu 20.04, Kali Linux 2021.1, Debian 10.7, and Fedora Workstation 33-1.2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get two sets of OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z earbuds for $30 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huv5wQCUFdwTESeD0RQ_VzZSrfo=/0x138:1235x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125128/EVky_U2XgAMdEv0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RXczoI"&gt;OnePlus is celebrating the anniversary of its launch of some products, including the Bullets Wireless Z and Warp Charge accessories, by offering discounts on them. Today’s best deal is on the Bullets Wireless Z, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-bullets-wireless-z&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383563%2Foneplus-wireless-bullets-z-earbuds-warp-charge-adapter-cable-vizio-elevate-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which are almost half-off at $30&lt;/a&gt;. Better yet, you can get two of them for the price of one, so your checkout price before tax will be just $30. This deal expires later today or once they sell out. I’d place your order sooner than later if you’re looking for some wireless neckbud-style earbuds for you and a pal or family member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U1vMXt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PlmMq2"&gt;While you’re shopping at OnePlus, you can get its Warp Charge 65W power adapter that’s powerful enough to charge some laptops. Usually $35, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-warp-charge-65-power-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383563%2Foneplus-wireless-bullets-z-earbuds-warp-charge-adapter-cable-vizio-elevate-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s down to $25&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great deal that will last until Tuesday, April 20th. Though, to get the fastest charging speeds with OnePlus phones, not just any cable will do, unfortunately. You’ll also need to get OnePlus’ Warp Charge USB-C cable, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-warp-charge-type-c-to-type-c-cable&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383563%2Foneplus-wireless-bullets-z-earbuds-warp-charge-adapter-cable-vizio-elevate-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is now $21 for the 150cm cable&lt;/a&gt; (about 59 inches long) instead of its usual $30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="laFQu6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445869"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hAmVR6"&gt;If you’d prefer to use your own USB-C cable, that’s understandable. But in that case, the Warp Charge 65W adapter will top out at 45W, which is the peak Power Delivery wattage. That’s still enough to recharge a MacBook Air at its usual charge speed, but if your laptop demands more power, I’d recommend getting the cable today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lBRHEOv7DhTIziMYxJT-UmiYTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19575314/Elevate.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vizio’s Elevate sound system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3f84Rb"&gt;There’s another good deal happening that doesn’t involve OnePlus. Vizio’s Elevate is a 48-inch soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and it features 18 speakers — some of which can automatically face upward to bounce sound off your ceiling when you’re playing Atmos content. It originally sold for $1,000, but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fvizio-elevate-p514a-h6-5-1-4-bluetooth-soundbar-speaker&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383563%2Foneplus-wireless-bullets-z-earbuds-warp-charge-adapter-cable-vizio-elevate-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots is offering a one-day sale that brings the price down to $779&lt;/a&gt;. For context, $700 was the best price ever, which we saw during Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeh2DS"&gt;If you want to get in on this sale, enter the code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGEVIZ &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to save 22 percent on the usual price. Wellbots offers free shipping and doesn’t charge sales tax on purchases made in the contiguous US, aside from NY state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mgU3Hv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HV8stj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>OBS gets native support for Nvidia’s excellent noise-canceling tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2NznJIbQh2X3sLnaegub3eoE0g=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125074/article_geforce_broadcasters_rtx_voice_og_no_text1200x630.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s AI-powered noise-removal technology does an excellent job at cancelling out background noise.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RRJYhg"&gt;Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), the go-to software for streamers, is getting native support for Nvidia’s excellent noise-removal technology, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fmortal-shell-ray-tracing-dlss-game-ready-driver%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383572%2Fopen-broadcaster-software-obs-nvidia-noise-removal-rtx-voice-broadcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;graphics card manufacturer announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Although it was previously possible to get the same effect by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fguides%2Fbroadcast-app-setup-guide%2F%23OBS-Studio&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383572%2Fopen-broadcaster-software-obs-nvidia-noise-removal-rtx-voice-broadcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;combining OBS with Nvidia’s Broadcast software&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll now be able to adjust the background noise-removal feature directly from within OBS. It’s currently available with the beta version of OBS Studio 27 and will be coming in a full release soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU0ahX"&gt;Nvidia’s noise-removal technology has been around for a little while, first as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229508/nvidia-rtx-voice-background-noise-reduce-graphics-card-improve-call-quality"&gt;RTX Voice&lt;/a&gt; and then as one of the features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"&gt;built into Nvidia Broadcast&lt;/a&gt;. The AI-powered tool can cancel out everything from keyboard clacking to your PC’s loud fans. It’s a great addition to a streamer’s arsenal, helping to filter out distracting background noise so viewers can focus on game audio and a streamer’s commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dEYrHNYJa28K5aFrEtyvrFlwXFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22443329/obs_nvidia_rtx_noise_suppression_filter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The integration means you can control the noise-removal feature from OBS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmXsMP"&gt;According to Nvidia’s announcement, you’ll need to download its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fbroadcasting%2Fbroadcast-sdk%2Fresources%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F14%2F22383572%2Fopen-broadcaster-software-obs-nvidia-noise-removal-rtx-voice-broadcast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Broadcast Audio Effects SDK&lt;/a&gt; to get the feature to work with the new beta version of OBS Studio 27. You’ll also need the company’s latest game-ready driver. Once you’ve got those downloaded, here’s how Nvidia describes the setup process: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HCcvz7"&gt;To use the new feature, open OBS, right click on your audio source in the Audio Mixer, select “Filters”, click on the “+” on the lower left of the new Filters window, pick the “Noise Suppression” filter, enter a name, click on the new filter in the list, expand the “Method” dropdown, select “NVIDIA Noise Removal”, tweak the intensity based on how loud your background noises are, then close the Filters window. NVIDIA Noise Removal is now active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8KSPht"&gt;The new integration arrived with Nvidia’s latest game-ready driver, which also adds support for &lt;em&gt;Mortal Shell&lt;/em&gt;’s RTX update as well as six new G-Sync-compatible displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sgfd3C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rk7eP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>F9 gets a fast and furious new trailer ahead of its June 25th debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VpAE_WoI-P-7dyPoXQ44W4BYom8=/192x0:1383x794/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125053/Screen_Shot_2021_04_14_at_8.07.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Universal Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="imO9DU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;— the imaginatively named ninth film in the increasingly physics-defying &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious &lt;/em&gt;franchise — &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fEE4RO-_jug"&gt;has a new trailer&lt;/a&gt;, arriving almost a full year after its original May 2020 release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttseSZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: potential spoilers for things that have already been widely revealed in the first trailer below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WbtxKu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Familiar faces return in the first trailer for Fast 9","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21113691/fast-and-furious-9-trailer-watch-super-bowl-vin-disel-cardi-b-john-cena"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="reM29i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; will see a whole roster of familiar faces from the &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; universe return, including Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), and Magdalene Shaw (Helen Mirren). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73vt3v"&gt;As revealed in the first trailer (released what feels like a lifetime ago in &lt;em&gt;January 2020&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; will also see the triumphant return of Sung Kang as Han Lue, whose character has been presumed dead since 2006’s &lt;em&gt;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, &lt;/em&gt;a fact that required the plotlines of movies&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;four through six in the &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; franchise to be set as prequels before &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Drift &lt;/em&gt;in order to allow Kang to continue to appear in the films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6f4U5"&gt;Also returning is Jordana Brewster’s Mia Toretto, who exited the franchise in &lt;em&gt;Furious 7&lt;/em&gt; when her character retired alongside Brian O’Conner (played by Paul Walker until his death in 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hb1mKd"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Furious&lt;/em&gt; gang will be facing off against John Cena, playing Jakob Toretto, the previously unseen third Toretto sibling to Diesel’s Dom and Brewster’s Mia, who’ll be teaming up with Cipher (Charlize Theron’s villainous hacker from &lt;em&gt;The Fate of the Furious&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrjSMz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; was originally set to hit theaters on May 22nd, 2020, but it has seen its release date bounce around the calendar due to theater shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s now set to hit theaters in the US on June 25th, and — barring any other delays — will be the first major blockbuster to debut since &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; last fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qctDYC"&gt;The film is also by no means the end of the popular franchise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526004/fast-furious-end-after-11-films-justin-lin-directing"&gt;Universal has plans for 10th and 11th films&lt;/a&gt; to finish out the mainline &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious &lt;/em&gt;series, in addition to further spinoffs (including a sequel to the somehow-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802401/hobbs-and-shaw-physics-jokes-jason-statham-dwayne-johnson-virus-hacking-science-technology"&gt;even-more-absurd &lt;em&gt;Hobbs &amp;amp; Shaw&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s hands-free BlueCruise driving feature coming soon to the F-150 and Mustang Mach-E  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SvAK38N_SEVlfnUkNl2EvcVYERU=/0x2:1434x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69125018/BlueCruise_Mustang_Mach_E_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qPTJWH"&gt;Ford has a name for its “hands-free” advanced driver assist system (ADAS): BlueCruise. The company said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software update to select &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303479/ford-2021-f-150-active-drive-assist-hybrid-specs-features-photos"&gt;2021 Ford F-150&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294866/fords-copilot-360-active-drive-assist-hands-free-driving-release"&gt;2021 Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt; owners later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ5bnG"&gt;According to Ford, BlueCruise will allow hands-free driving on “prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up more than 100,000 miles of North American roads.” Yes, Ford is even branding the highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cfhttt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Hands-Free Blue Zones”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5vK4N"&gt;BlueCruise is Ford’s answer to General Motors’ Super Cruise, which is considered the gold standard for Level 2 advanced driver assist systems. These systems work in concert with a number of distinct features, like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blindspot detection, pedestrian monitoring, and stop sign detection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeVK1U"&gt;What makes these systems stand apart, though, is the inclusion of an active driver monitoring system in the form of an infrared sensor on the steering column that tracks the drivers’ eyes to make sure they are keeping them on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S3a2Cl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BlueCruise! We tested it in the real world, so our customers don’t have to. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dgqVkWH31r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dgqVkWH31r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1382323413826555904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLdRRO"&gt;Not every F-150 and Mach-E will be automatically eligible for the software update. F-150 owners who opted for the $1,595 Ford Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package can purchase BlueCruise for an additional $600. For Mustang Mach-E owners, BlueCruise will come standard on the CA Route 1, Premium, and First Edition variants as part of the $3,200 Comfort and Technology package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmN46R"&gt;Until then, owners will have access to the second generation of Ford’s ADAS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17126162/ford-driver-assist-technology-copilot-360"&gt;known as Co-Pilot 360&lt;/a&gt;. This includes improved versions of features like lane centering, adaptive cruise control, active park assist, blindspot assist, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbpzmC"&gt;Ford is also shifting into high marketing gear for the new feature. The company deployed 10 test vehicles — five F-150s and five Mach-Es — on a 110,000-mile road trip through 37 states and five Canadian provinces to test BlueCruise in a variety of road conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QbwkGL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford is shifting into high marketing gear for the new feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TePXhQ"&gt;“There are highway intricacies and driving conditions that you simply cannot replicate in a lab,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product platform and operations officer, in a statement. “Sending these vehicles out for real-world driving experience is just one of many ways we ensured that BlueCruise technology offers confidence and convenience for drivers all across the continent.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INg7GL"&gt;Ford said it expects to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4DlmW"&gt;Car consumers are certainly attracted to more high-tech systems, especially if they can promise a safer, more stress-free driving experience. A survey conducted by Edmunds in late 2017 found that 58 percent of car shoppers would pay an extra $1,000 or more for a vehicle equipped with active safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoQz7D"&gt;A lot depends on how these systems are marketed to customers. For example, Tesla has said Autopilot should only be used by attentive drivers with both hands on the wheel. But the feature is designed to assist drivers, not replace them. And it’s far from foolproof: there have been several high-profile incidents in which some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/30/12072408/tesla-autopilot-car-crash-death-autonomous-model-s"&gt;drivers have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16923800/tesla-firetruck-crash-autopilot-investigation"&gt;engaged Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17182824/tesla-model-x-crash-autopilot-statement"&gt; crashed&lt;/a&gt;, and died. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL aims to build a better budget phone with the 20 Pro 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCZilEyPsfqjlhmV6PBSvFSapXY=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124944/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers a 6.67-inch screen and 48-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YetCgh"&gt;TCL has announced the rest of its 20-series lineup, with the 20 Pro 5G leading the way. Along with the 20L and 20L Plus, the phone joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;two devices announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at CES, the TCL 20 5G and 20 SE, all of which prominently feature the company’s display technology. TCL says the 20 Pro 5G and 20S (a regional variant of the 20L Plus) will come to the US this summer, though the company hasn’t confirmed prices yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lk7kQb"&gt;The TCL 20 Pro 5G offers the most advanced specs of the bunch, with some refinements over last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;good-not-great 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a 6.67-inch 1080p OLED with HDR10 support and includes the latest generation of TCL’s NXTVISION technology to identify on-screen content and adjust color, contrast, and sharpness accordingly. The 20 Pro 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G chipset — a step up from the 10 Pro’s 600-series processor — with 6GB RAM, ships with Android 11, and offers a 4,500mAh battery. Sub-6GHz 5G is supported, but TCL says it can adapt to include other 5G bands depending on the carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HbzjVkiVB0lvVWnta7m8ROdjbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22441810/TCL_20_Pro_5G_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G will come to the US this summer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PNeHDG"&gt;The phone’s main camera uses a 48-megapixel sensor with a small but important addition: optical image stabilization. It’s a feature that should help reduce blur in lower-light conditions, and it wasn’t offered on any of last year’s 10-series models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBhCb0"&gt;The standard wide camera is accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth-sensing chip, and 32-megapixel selfie camera. For biometric unlock, the 20 Pro includes an in-display fingerprint sensor. We’re pleased to report that the 3.5mm headphone jack remains, and a microSD card slot is available for expansion on the 256GB of built-in storage. The 20 Pro 5G goes on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal for €549 (about $655).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C9Qmm2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10444791"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8XOQi"&gt;The TCL 20L and 20L Plus are more budget-oriented devices. They both offer a 6.67-inch 1080p LCD, a 5,000mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 662 processor. The 20L offers 4GB of RAM in its base model, while the Plus model starts at 6GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnwNfh"&gt;The 20L Plus also features a 64-megapixel main camera, while the 20L includes a 48-megapixel main sensor; both devices include an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, 2-megapixel depth sensor, and 16-megapixel selfie camera. Both phones also use circular polarization display technology, so that the screen is visible from any angle when viewing it with polarized sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekN725"&gt;The 20L and 20L Plus go on sale tomorrow in the UK, Italy, and Portugal, starting at €229 and €269, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ0clq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will test letting users toggle public like counts on and off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_LZVg2CeDJ9vG4mtlOyDrmv6Pk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124949/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rf1B9"&gt;Instagram will test giving people more control over where they see like counts on posts. The company announced a “small global test” that will present users with three options when it comes to the like count: choosing not to see like counts on anyone’s posts, turning them off for their own posts, or keeping the original experience. It also said it was “working on a similar experience” for Facebook, but it hasn’t clarified what that might look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aD0MNF"&gt;This builds on an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;initial Instagram test&lt;/a&gt; that hid the public like count for certain users around the world. In that case, users didn’t have a choice about whether they saw the like count or not. Instagram told users at the time that it wanted people to “focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.” Influencers initially worried this could impact brand deals because their engagement rates wouldn’t be public, but that reality hasn’t played out because they’ve been able to view their own like counts privately and share them with brand partners. Still, providing a more custom experience might be the right direction for the platform to move toward, giving people who are aware of how public like counts make them feel a chance to escape them, while also allowing people who want to keep track of the counts able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbVdti"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885990/facebook-hide-public-like-count-test-user-experience-australia"&gt;also initially&lt;/a&gt; tested hiding the public like count in 2019. That test hid public like, reaction, and video view counts. It’s unclear whether this new test could apply to all of those surfaces or just the like count on posts. That Facebook test isn’t live yet, and Facebook says it’ll be learning from this new test and will “have more to share soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fantasian isn’t just charming; it’s the most approachable JRPG I’ve ever played</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njTuZ7AstBp42XSX-yvsdfDl-Nw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124668/6_4k.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PhEgjr"&gt;Before &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; launched on Apple Arcade, most of the discussion centered on how it looked. There was a good reason for that. Mistwalker, the studio helmed by &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;pioneered a new technique that involved crafting more than 150 incredible, charming dioramas&lt;/a&gt;, which were then photographed to become the locations you explore in the game. Whether you’re venturing through a wind-swept desert, luxury cruise ship, or robot metropolis, every area you visit in &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; was handcrafted from real-world materials. It not only looks amazing, but it lends the game’s fantasy world a very particular vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUWwVE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is also just a great game. It’s not particularly original, hewing very closely to the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games that Sakaguchi built his career on. But it also takes those ideas and mechanics and changes them just enough to feel fresh, while also making some notable quality-of-life changes. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just an adorable handcrafted game from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;; it’s the most approachable Japanese RPG I’ve ever played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mkWP5q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyieFJ"&gt;The premise is, admittedly, not very original. If you’re played a JRPG any time over the last two decades, it’ll probably feel familiar. You play as Leo, a hero who has lost his memory and quickly gets pulled into a quest for the fate of the world. It’s hard to talk too much about details of the story since, for most of the game, Leo doesn’t even know what’s going on. Early on, you’re mostly just following leads, as Leo goes pretty much anywhere he can in order to potentially learn more about who he is. You’ll explore mysterious and well-guarded vaults, visit gorgeous cities on the water, and eventually be transported to a mechanical realm ruled by robots. It’s a lengthy adventure, though what’s available now is actually only the first of two parts, with the second expected to release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PRG7QF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePFgyBtvqQU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8cGkR"&gt;The story itself is… fine. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; certainly doesn’t live up to its spiritual predecessors in that regard. I never felt any real sense of urgency as I saved the world, and few of the main cast of characters are very memorable. It’s cute at times, and there are some interesting surprises and worldbuilding details to dig into. Mostly, it just gets the job done. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is much more about the vibe than the narrative. I loved poking around each and every location, seeing the buildings and landscape from different angles. I didn’t really care &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;I was doing it. The handmade diorama art style is reminiscent of the pre-rendered backgrounds from the PlayStation era, except with a much finer level of detail. An incredible soundtrack from frequent Sakaguchi collaborator Nobuo Uematsu only adds to the nostalgia. It’s a world you want to linger in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hotmEF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t just look and sound familiar; it also plays a lot like the classics it’s inspired by. That means random battles, turn-based combat, and a relatively straightforward character customization. The battles, in particular, do some interesting things. While there are familiar elements — like enemies with elemental weaknesses and bosses that change forms mid-fight — there are also some nice twists, like spells and weapons that you can aim to maximize your attack by hitting as many enemies as possible in one shot. It makes battles, particularly bosses, feel more strategic and less mindless. It’s really satisfying when you line things up &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pgu6QD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Arcade finally got the boost it needed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0O2xDv"&gt;Perhaps the best addition is the awkwardly named dimengeon — a portmanteau of dimension and dungeon — that lets you put off random battles for a short period. Essentially, when you turn the feature on, any monster you come across gets trapped in this device, and it can hold up to 30 of them at a time. Whenever you want — or whenever it’s full — you can then take on all of the trapped monsters in one giant brawl. It’s a great feature for when you just want to explore without fighting or when you’re in a rush to get to a save point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Q324r"&gt;There is a handful of other quality-of-life tweaks — plentiful save points, locations that are big but simple to navigate, touch and gamepad controls that work equally well, little need for grinding — that add up to an incredibly accessible take on the classic formula. &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; streamlines the genre, keeping the parts that work best, while updating the rest for modern tastes. There are a few small hiccups, like flat cutscenes and some jarring difficulty spikes toward the end. But at its best, &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; is everything Sakaguchi does best, just in a slightly smaller and more refined package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWs2oB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fantasian &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on Apple Arcade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How CO2 sensors might help us return to ‘normal’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gRdJocWNv1qH5XJa_oVPVfLoItA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69124596/CONTAINER.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63Tmg5"&gt;One of the things we’ve learned over the past year is to be wary of the air around us — especially indoors. If other people are around, exhaling, they’re filling the space with their breath. If one of those people has COVID-19, they could be filling the space with &lt;em&gt;infectious&lt;/em&gt; breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NUWnp"&gt;There’s a way to make indoor spaces safer, though: improving the ventilation to make sure the air doesn’t stay trapped. That way, any potentially infectious particles&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;quickly gust away, instead of lingering for someone else to breathe in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOTz9i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/"&gt;Experts say one way to measure&lt;/a&gt; how well-ventilated certain spaces are is by checking how much carbon dioxide is in the air. People exhale carbon dioxide, so the amount of it in a room gives you an idea&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;how much of the air is made up of other people’s breath. It’s not a perfect measure of danger — it won’t tell you if there is actually virus around — but it’s a pretty good proxy for how risky a room could be. It’s easy to check a room’s carbon dioxide levels: all you need is a small, portable monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKFyz0"&gt;To test this idea, the &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;team took one of those monitors all around Brooklyn, New York, to check out the ventilation at local grocery stores, bagel shops, and bars. Watch our latest video to see what we found. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RtRGuJ"&gt;Last February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276265/epic-games-digital-human-creator-unreal-engine-realistic-human-faces"&gt;Epic Games wowed us&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/digital-humans"&gt;the MetaHuman Creator&lt;/a&gt;, a new cloud-based app that lets people make highly realistic digital humans that can be rigged and animated in Unreal Engine. At the time, the tool wasn’t out yet, but today, Epic is opening it up in early access. It won’t be available for everyone to use right away, though — you have to register your interest first, and then Epic has to grant you access, though the company says it will move quickly to let everyone in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVaGI3"&gt;If you didn’t catch the announcement of MetaHuman Creator in February, I strongly recommend that you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mAF5dWZXcI"&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt; of two MetaHumans talking about themselves to see them in action. The digital avatars move in a stunningly realistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="133NgK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6mAF5dWZXcI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="38bLRe"&gt;You can also get an idea of how the MetaHuman Creator tool works in this new video from Epic. The app looks to offer an impressive level of customizability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L01VI5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OeUBATSJSr0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SgqQgK"&gt;And if you want to take a look at some still images of MetaHumans, take a look at this gallery with some examples from Epic — there’s an incredible level on these avatars. I’m particularly impressed by the way hair looks.&lt;/p&gt;
