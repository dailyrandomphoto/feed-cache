    <title>Apple’s excuse for no AirTag in Siri Remote: it’s too thick to easily lose in your couch</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0Qos8"&gt;We have poked a &lt;em&gt;considerable&lt;/em&gt; amount of fun at the Apple TV’s Siri Remote over the years, and we’re pleased to say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;it’s finally fixed&lt;/a&gt; — except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/5/10/22429238/apple-tv-siri-remote-airtag-case-combine-3d-print-design"&gt;the headsmacking decision &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to stick the company’s AirTag UWB locator technology&lt;/a&gt; into one of the few gadgets absolutely, positively guaranteed to get lost in your couch cushions someday. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlPSKR"&gt;Today, Apple VP Tim Twerdahl &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;answered that burning question&lt;/a&gt; in perhaps the most unsatisfactory way imaginable: simply, that the new TV remote’s thick enough you shouldn’t need to worry about that much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMTTIH"&gt;Here’s the whole exchange &lt;a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2021/05/21/apple-vp-tim-twerdahl-talks-apple-tv-2021-gaming-future/"&gt;between Twerdahl and &lt;em&gt;MobileSyrup’s &lt;/em&gt;Patrick O’Rourke&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38EvNI"&gt;Q: Was there ever any thought to adding some sort of AirTag-like technology in the Siri remote? I’m always losing the remote in my couch cushions and it seems like it would be a great idea. Did Apple not bother because the ‘Find My’ network is more designed for use outside of the home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l66XrV"&gt;Twerdahl: We are super excited about AirTags and what we’re doing with U1, and part of that power is the Find My network and the fact that we can leverage a billion devices around the world to help you find stuff. To your point, that is the most powerful out of the home. With the changes we’ve made to the Siri Remote — including making it a bit thicker so it won’t fall in your couch cushions as much — that need to have all these other network devices find it seems a little bit lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JXgDT3"&gt;I would have perhaps bought “we tried it and it drained the battery too quickly” or “we finalized the Siri Remote before AirTags were ready” or even “it cost too much to hit our target price.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml2s0N"&gt;But thickness? My Roku remotes got swallowed by my couch cushions &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt;, and those thick suckers had AA batteries and full-size headphone jacks inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CMm1d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch says&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s right about one thing, though — compared to the original Siri Remote’s thinness, it’s an improvement where couches are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A 20-year-old Xbox Easter egg has been revealed, and there may still be more </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XukfFa1hlS2LBdEjRSvGkBCRhxw=/141x0:2733x1728/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69326414/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_2.07.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Kotaku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="676vGD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-an-original-xbox-easter-egg-thats-remained-hidden-1846926839"&gt;has revealed an Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; that’s been hidden on the original Xbox for almost twenty years, after a developer who worked on the console sent in a tip. The Easter egg, which has apparently remained secret until now, can show you the Xbox Dashboard Team’s names after you follow a byzantine set of steps (as is par for the course when it comes to some video game secrets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9z1jOt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; was able to find someone with a working Xbox who could actually carry out those steps, which you can see in the publication’s video below. If you’ve got one of the consoles, you can try it out for yourself by ripping a CD as a soundtrack and calling it “Timmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!” (using 26 “y”s to reach the maximum amount of characters allowed). After the rip is complete, going to the Xbox’s Settings &amp;gt; System Info screen will instead display the names of the people who worked on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pbvUiu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHQgUaviUCc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgwDiU"&gt;The Easter egg is similar to another one that exists on Microsoft’s original console, where naming a soundtrack rip “&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Eggsßox&amp;gt;&amp;gt;” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHK-9_0PNc"&gt;will immediately play credits&lt;/a&gt; thanking the console’s development partners and players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbObF7"&gt;Developers hiding their names in games and consoles is nothing new. In fact, it’s widely believed that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2017/12/20/the-true-story-behind-the-original-video-game-easter-egg-that-inspired-ready-player-one/?sh=5a9f0fde2976"&gt;the first video game Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; was created by a developer trying to get their name into their game. As the story goes, developer Warren Robinett hid his name in the 1980 game &lt;em&gt;Adventure &lt;/em&gt;after Atari refused to give him credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSOjqd"&gt;Modern consoles also like to incorporate various winks and nods to gaming culture as well — the PS5 has PlayStation’s iconic circle, triangle, square, cross symbols &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;molded into some of its plastic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21133169/fisher-price-konami-code-baby-toy-game-and-learn-controller"&gt;this Fisher-Price gamepad for literal babies&lt;/a&gt; incorporates the famous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code"&gt;Konami Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2aray"&gt;Despite gamers being ever-vigilant for hidden secrets, it seems as if there’s still at least one hiding somewhere in the Xbox. As &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; points out, Seamus Blackley, the creator and designer of the Xbox &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/912802600675717121"&gt;tweeted in 2017 that there was still a hidden secret that no one had found&lt;/a&gt;. But the one revealed Friday wasn’t what he was referring to, he told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PkcIDr"&gt;Thankfully, Blackley was kind enough to respond to a few queries about all of this. He confirmed that yes, the Xbox Easter egg he has in mind does in fact revolve around the Xbox’s boot animation, and is not the “Timmy” secret we’re revealing today—which he actually didn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="imoib5"&gt;It seems the egg hunt can continue on for fans of the ancient console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tim Cook faces harsh questions about the App Store from judge in Fortnite trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple And Maker Of Popular Video Game Fortnite, Epic Continue Court Battle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JUTl2gR8qxzbuuZv9NgPUCaRln4=/0x0:2954x1969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325873/1233025915.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tim Cook is seen through a window of the federal courthouse in San Francisco | Photo by Philip Pacheco/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78jNcW"&gt;Apple called CEO Tim Cook to conclude three weeks of testimony in &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple — &lt;/em&gt;and with the end of the trial approaching, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers engaged Cook in a surprisingly tense exchange over Apple’s business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eenHBa"&gt;Rogers noted that most of Apple’s App Store revenue comes from games, and she asked Cook why developers can’t use other payment methods to sell in-app purchases, or at least tell users they can make those transactions elsewhere. “If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ghs6I"&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual property],” Cook said bluntly. Apple has talked repeatedly about the work it puts into maintaining the App Store and the iOS platform, and it’s accused companies like Epic of wanting a free ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8dhc5"&gt;Rogers made the opposite case. “The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="me8v4C"&gt;Cook countered that Apple’s many free apps attracted a larger audience than developers could get on their own. “We need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3pdOXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTwpJQ"&gt;But Rogers didn’t sound convinced. She asked why Apple wouldn’t take a cut of something like a banking app transaction: “You don’t charge Wells Fargo, right? Or Bank of America? But you’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.” When Cook said it was because Apple specifically charged for digital goods sales, Rogers noted that Apple itself had defined that rule — saying it was a deliberate choice of business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuVPpw"&gt;“I understand this notion that somehow Apple’s bringing the customers to the users. But after that first time, after that first interaction, the [developers] are keeping the customer with the games. Apple’s just profiting off that, it seems to me,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="welc1v"&gt;She also said it didn’t sound like Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;recent App Store price drops&lt;/a&gt; were motivated by competition — just fear of regulation and lawsuits. “The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition,” said Rogers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dx3UEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cook says Apple’s commission covers tech, customer service, and a giant user base&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yodJ6"&gt;Cook replied that after Apple had lowered some commissions to 15 percent, Google did the same, indicating that there was competition, but the judge was dismissive of this argument. “I understand perhaps that [was the issue] when Google changed its price, but your action wasn’t the result of competition,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrBGnO"&gt;The heart of the issue, for Rogers, seems to be a survey that indicates 39 percent of developers were “somewhat” or “very” dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. “How is that acceptable, and how is it — assuming those numbers are true — how is it that you’re feeling any motivation and incentive to address their needs?” she asked Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8kR4H"&gt;Cook said that sometimes, developers’ and users’ needs conflict — and Cook emphasized in his earlier testimony that Apple puts users first. But he acknowledged that he didn’t regularly get surveys on developer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70gzES"&gt;We won’t know the verdict of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; for weeks or months, and there’s one day of arguments left in court. The exchange with Cook doesn’t necessarily tell us how Rogers will eventually rule, and it certainly doesn’t mean Epic will get some of its bigger demands met. It does suggest, however, that Rogers is seriously considering Epic’s argument that Apple has too much control over one specific part of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYF5bM"&gt;You can find the full exchange between Rogers and Cook below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bCJKd2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;At the beginning of your testimony, you indicated that you wanted to focus on users. I’ve seen evidence that a significant portion of revenue from in-app purchases comes from gamers. Have you seen evidence to that effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udVoFP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I have, your honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8dSZi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And it’s incredibly significant — compared to all other users, revenue is coming from gamers more than anyone else, am I right in my current understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdYBsZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;The majority of the revenue on the App Store comes from games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PI8oVX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And in-app purchases in particular, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="766va2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wao55I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;The other thing you said is that you want to give users control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juPrX9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. For their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xskhWD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So what is the problem with allowing users to have choice, especially in a gaming context, to have a cheaper option for content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unMSkU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I think they have a choice today. They have a choice between many different Android models of smartphone or an iPhone, and that iPhone has a certain set of principles behind it, from safety and security to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4y6hk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But if they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option? Or at least the information that they can go and have a different option for making purchases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIQXzH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;If we allowed people to link out like that, we would in essence give up our total return on our IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whMFY9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But you could also monetize it a different way, couldn’t you? I mean, that is, the gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLxXaM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;The bulk of the apps on the App Store are free, so you’re right that there is some sort of subsidy there. However, the way I look at that, Your Honor, is that by having such a large number of apps that are free on the store, it increases the traffic to the store dramatically, so the benefit somebody gets is a much higher audience to sell to than they would otherwise if there weren’t free apps there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGPu0l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So your logic then is that it’s more of a customer base, not an IP, then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XOPK7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s both, because we need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcii3J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But let me ask you, so banking apps. I have multiple banking apps, I haven’t paid for them, but I suspect other than the $99, you don’t charge Wells Fargo, right? Or Bank of America? But you’re charging the gamers to subsidize Wells Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cvuTc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;In the gamers example, they’re transacting on our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02eamZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;People are doing lots of things on your platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZI2HM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;But this is a digital transaction with an observable change in currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xr423"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s just a choice of a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni40Ij"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve made a choice. There are clearly other ways to monetize, but we chose this one, because we think this one overall is the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Zfxs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it’s quite lucrative. But it seems to be lucrative and focused on purchases that are being made frankly on an impulse basis — that’s a totally different question, about whether that’s a good thing or not, it’s not really right for antitrust law — but it does appear to be disproportionate. I understand this notion that somehow Apple’s bringing the customers to the users. But after that first time, after that first interaction, the [developers] are keeping the customer with the games. Apple’s just profiting off that, it seems to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bvk7l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I view it differently than you do, Your Honor. I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we’re doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there. We do that with a lot of free apps, so [even if] we don’t collect a commission from them they bring a lot to the table. And then we have the majority of other people that pay 15 percent, and only the people that are really profiting in a major way are paying 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xakG44"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, but the 15 percent, right... you would agree with the basic proposition that competition is good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VtTbm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I think competition is great. We have fierce competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD5lbN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have competition in those in-app purchases, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meLsrP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, I mean somebody could go if they’re a gamer they could go buy it on the Sony PlayStation or the Microsoft Xbox or the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdOVHr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Only if they know, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0LSTm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, but that’s up to the developer to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrdELJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;And only if they decide to switch in terms of how they do things, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyJjt2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;Usually people have both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j17YFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;The issue with the $1 million Small Business Program, at least from what I’ve seen thus far: that really wasn’t the result of competition. That seemed to be a result of the pressure that you’re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits, not competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGgxQA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was the result of feeling like we should do something from a COVID point of view, and then electing to instead of doing something very temporary, to do something permanent. And of course we had the lawsuits and all the rest of the stuff in the back of our head, but the thing that triggered it was, we were very worried about small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkfwFU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, but it wasn’t competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsAWRf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was competition after we did our 15, it was competition that made Google drop theirs to 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2hcSO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;I understand perhaps that when Google changed its price, but your action wasn’t the result of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMPFJU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;It was the result of feeling like we should do something for small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDyM1T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;So when other stores reduced their price, Steam reduced their price, you felt no pressure to reduce your price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNEa3r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not familiar with Steam and their financial model. One of the things that’s missed here is that there’s a huge competition for developers. It’s not just competition on the user side, it’s also with the developer side, in addition to the users. You can imagine that if we had an above-market kind of commission, people just wouldn’t develop for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkopGC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s talk about developers. I’m seeing evidence in the record that there’s a survey of developers — I’m going to share the results of this bar graph that was presented to me. I don’t know how accurate it is, because I looked for the source document and couldn’t find it. But this survey indicated that 39 percent of developers were either very dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with Apple’s distribution services. 36 percent were somewhat satisfied or very satisfied, and 19 percent didn’t go either way, they’re in the middle. So with 39 percent of all your developers dissatisfied, how is that acceptable and how is it — assuming those numbers are true — how is it that you’re feeling any motivation and incentive to address their needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTKhn0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not familiar with the document you’re referencing, and so it’s hard to comment on certain specifics. But keep in mind that on a weekly basis, we’re rejecting 40 percent [of apps sent for review], so there’s definitely some friction in the system. But this friction is what produces a curated experience for users, that they love and they can go somewhere and be assured that it’s safe and trusted. So sometimes the developer and the user, their interests don’t intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzMT1n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;But it doesn’t seem to me that you feel under pressure or competition to actually change the manner in which you act to address the concerns of the developers — again, if these numbers are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nVeW4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I would look at it in a different way. We turn the place upside down for developers. Look at a complaint that I might get, and look at the amount of time for a change to be made in the company. It’s amazing, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdJOFy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve seen a number of profit and loss statements, and again you see the 100 binders behind me — I don’t recall seeing any other surveys or any other business records showing that you routinely conduct surveys regarding developer satisfaction and that you in fact move or make changes. I take with a grain of salt each side’s anecdotal evidence. What I’m looking for are aggregates. Do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BvpYW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know if we do that. That would be something that Phil [Schiller] would know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4r3fT1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogers: &lt;/strong&gt;You certainly as the CEO then don’t receive regular reports on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoQmq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkM4yM"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5zZmzF"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children who take a mix of in-person and online classes. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Distance learners can still run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Zoom will be a large part of university life this semester: many kids will be attending virtual classes, while others will still be meeting with clubs, study groups, and professors as well as hanging out with friends online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New research shows how many important links on the web get lost to time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgSfp3Rp-yTwT8XGEjAtUFCU3CY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325496/VRG_ILLO_4489_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y63Zsg"&gt;A quarter of the deep links in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’ &lt;/em&gt;articles are now rotten, leading to completely inaccessible pages, &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/linkrot-content-drift-new-york-times.php"&gt;according to a team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; from Harvard Law School, who &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395750908349325315?s=20"&gt;worked with the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ digital team&lt;/a&gt;. They found that this problem affected over half of the articles containing links in the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s catalog going back to 1996, illustrating the problem of link rot and how difficult it is for context to survive on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1K0Xf"&gt;The study looked at over 550,000 articles, which contained over 2.2 million links to external websites. It found that 72 percent of those links were “deep,” or pointing to a specific page rather than a general website. Predictably, it found that, as time went on, links were more likely to be dead: 6 percent of links in 2018 articles were inaccessible, while a whopping 72 percent of links from 1998 were dead. For a recent, widespread example of link rot in practice, just look at what happened &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222371/trump-ban-twitter-link-rot-embedded-dead-posts"&gt;when Twitter banned Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;: all of the articles that were embedded in his tweets were littered with gray boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0AEfIGo685Zgg1vCpvErEkuLFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531243/Linkrot_frequency_over_time.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A reverse view of link rot over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gPXwdI"&gt;The team chose &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;in part because the paper is known for its archiving practices, but it’s not suggesting the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; is all that unusual in its link rot problems. Rather, it’s using the paper of record as an example of a phenomenon that happens all across the internet. As time goes by, the websites that once provided valuable insight, important context, or proof of contentious claims through links will be bought and sold, or simply just stop existing, leaving the link to lead to an empty page — or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BWrhw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/deansterlingjones/links-for-sale-on-major-news-wesbites"&gt;reported in 2019&lt;/a&gt; on the underground industry that exists where customers can pay marketers to find dead links in big outlets like the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; and buy the domain for themselves. Then, they can do whatever they want with the link, like using it to advertise products or to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zittrain/status/1395756927959842821?s=20"&gt;host a message making fun&lt;/a&gt; of the article’s subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04MASF"&gt;Link rot doesn’t just affect journalism, either. Imagine if Rick Astley’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;“Never Gonna Give You Up” video&lt;/a&gt; was deleted and reuploaded. There would be countless Reddit threads and tweet replies that would no longer make sense to future readers. Or imagine if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;trying to display your NFT&lt;/a&gt;, and you discover that the source link now points to nowhere. What a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qwy0ir"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Until we find a solution, articles will continue to lose more and more context as time goes on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="axkXsH"&gt;There has been some work done in trying to preserve links. Wikipedia, for example, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Preventing_and_repairing_dead_links"&gt;asks that contributors writing citations&lt;/a&gt; provide a link to a page’s archive on sites like the Wayback Machine if they think an article is likely to change. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2014/03/perma-scoping-and-addressing-the-problem-of-link-and-reference-rot-in-legal-citations/"&gt;Perma.cc project&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to fix the issue of link rot in legal citations and academic journals by providing an archived version of the page, along with a link to the original source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVirSD"&gt;It’s unlikely, though, that the smattering of similar projects out there would be able to solve the issue for the entire internet, including social networks, or even just for journalists. Until we find a solution, articles will continue to lose more and more context as time goes on. As a perfect example: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/15/3021913/chesapeake-digital-preservation-group-link-rot-report"&gt;our article on link rot from 2012&lt;/a&gt; has a source link to The Chesapeake Digital Preservation Group, which now leads to a 404 page. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch launches a dedicated ‘hot tubs’ category after advertiser pushback</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9nIAT9EbIaTLR-wU1rO943SWIE=/0x0:2463x1642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325278/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_3.08.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of Twitch’s new hot tubs category.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7X1K7G"&gt;Twitch is launching a dedicated category for hot tub streams after claiming that it has received pushback from advertisers and viewers about how the trend has taken over the platform. The new “&lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Pools%2C%20Hot%20Tubs%2C%20and%20Beaches"&gt;Pools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches&lt;/a&gt;” category is meant to let creators stream what they want, while also giving Twitch advertisers a more convenient way to prevent ads from running on streams that they don’t approve of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqfLdl"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442733/amouranth-twitch-ads-suspended-indefinitely"&gt;Twitch pulled advertising&lt;/a&gt; from some hot tub streamers without warning. In a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;today, the company said that was a mistake. “We did not alert impacted creators at the time, and we should have–our creators rely on us,” a spokesperson said. Twitch said the ads were suspended at advertisers’ request and that it’s now working with individual creators to “restore ads where appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa7gyl"&gt;In particular, the ad suspension hit Amouranth, who is one of the platform’s biggest streamers. Her channel is now showing ads again, though it appears her hot tub streams have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qeyor0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“First and foremost, no one deserves to be harassed for the content they choose to stream.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xwYbkO"&gt;Twitch says its policies on what is and isn’t allowed on the platform aren’t changing. The company is not going to prevent people from streaming in hot tubs or swimwear. While sexually suggestive content remains banned, context-appropriate clothing — like bathing suits in a pool — is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crO0uY"&gt;“Being found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness,” the company wrote, in bold, in &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/05/21/lets-talk-about-hot-tub-streams/"&gt;a blog post this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. The post is a surprisingly direct message from a tech company laying out the competing interests and problems being faced in a situation that most other companies would address in a vague manner at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCysgl"&gt;Hot tub streamers tend to be women, and they’ve often faced sexist harassment from men who don’t like seeing them or their success on Twitch. Twitch’s new system plays into that to an extent — it pulls their streams out of the very popular “Just Chatting” section and moves it into the brand-new hot tub section — but it also validates that this type of streaming is allowed and welcomed on the platform. In its blog post, the company says “first and foremost, no one deserves to be harassed for the content they choose to stream.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUlyjO"&gt;Twitch says that adding a new category is not its long-term solution to giving advertisers more control over what streams their ads run on. But it views this as a short-term solution, saying it allows viewers to avoid or seek out hot tub content and gives creators a place to continue streaming it. Brands will be able to opt in or out of placing ads on streams in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE4UnC"&gt;That could be bad news for creators, though. The so-called “&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitchs-hot-tub-meta-has-sparked-off-yet-another-debate-1846600932"&gt;hot tub meta&lt;/a&gt;” has been a huge success for streamers, but part of the reason for participating in it is that more viewers generally means more ad revenue. If Twitch can’t get advertisers to opt into the hot tubs section, there may be fewer streamers willing to take part.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create an Instagram carousel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sUOgBQCshoJtP1J8MW0mCtdXzLg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325159/akrales_200423_3988_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RSM4nA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: According to a Facebook company spokesperson, the issue described below with the iOS carousel feature is attributable to a bug: “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing the ‘Select Multiple’ photos feature in Instagram due to a bug in the latest iOS update and are working on a solution.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UPQiE"&gt; Whenever we use an app continuously, any change to the UI of that app can cause stress — and during these stressful times, who needs more? For example, in a recent update, Instagram tweaked the way it asks its users to create carousels (groups of up to 10 photos or videos that rotate through a single post), and this is apparently causing a bit of confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKGaOI"&gt;This new method was pointed out in the Instagram account Digital Mums, where you can find some great tips on how to use various features of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NKUS6r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CPGkaaEjl1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"&gt;&lt;div style="padding:16px;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CPGkaaEjl1R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"&gt; &lt;div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s696FR"&gt;If you’d prefer some text instructions on how to navigate the change, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="iRP9Vi"&gt;In your Instagram app (iOS or Android), select the “Add Post” icon (the plus icon on the top line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9BdrGQ"&gt;You’ll see a selection of your photos. You can change the source of your photos if you wish by clicking on the source name (Recents, Videos, etc.) and then choosing a different one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EjVVNL"&gt;Press and hold the first photo or video you want to include in your carousel until the number 1 appears in the corner of the photo. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZcXzH3"&gt;If you’re using Android, there will be a “Select Multiple” icon above your photo gallery. If you want, you can perform the same task by tapping on the first image you want to include, and then tapping on the “Select Multiple” icon. (The iOS version doesn’t include that icon, so you’re stuck with “press and hold.”)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Press and hold the first image you want to include" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2MGFDHLXsqwl45Ld_bVrRE0knPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531309/IMG_2D26DF6DE260_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press and hold the first image you want to include, and then select the rest (this is the iOS version)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Press and hold the first image you want to include" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRrg9IIrNO7cYtl_qzUdXZ3kBBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531220/Instagram_1aScreenshot__May_21__2021_1_41_49_PM_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Android version, there is also a “Select Multiple” icon you can use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0lAr5B"&gt;Continue to select the images you want to include. They will be numbered in the order in which you select them. In order to change the order, you’ll have to tap on the numbers on the images you want to re-order, and then add them back in their correct order. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oY4pKx"&gt;Once you’ve got all your photos selected and in the correct order, choose the “Next” arrow in the top right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5bUYEf"&gt;Now you can edit or apply a filter to one or all of your photos. You can then go on to the final “New Post” screen that lets you write a caption, tag people, post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gSGTLl"&gt;Easy-peasy — until, of course, the next time Instagram decides to alter its interface...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5ZLMK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 21st, 2021, 5:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;  Added a statement from Facebook explaining that the issue with the IOS version of Instagram is due to a bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Citizen, the vigilante justice app, has a plan to deploy private security forces, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpzNxcu_oy1ZmpJu91d8t7O6w1k=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325155/citizen_suf_security.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="evuFVS"&gt;This morning, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;published a story about how Citizen — an app that appears to encourage vigilante justice — encouraged its users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447446/citizen-app-internal-slack-palisades-fire-arson-bounty-manhunt-los-angeles"&gt;to hunt down &lt;em&gt;the wrong person&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and presumably bring them to justice, in the mistaken assumption that person had started the 1,158-acre Palisades wildfire in Los Angeles last week. The company offered a $30,000 bounty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUHfZh"&gt;Now, we’re learning the same company is apparently planning to offer its own private security forces to users, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7evbx/citizen-app-private-security-leaked-emails"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXziIE"&gt;In fact, one Citizen-branded patrol car has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brandonwenerd/status/1395045423958478849"&gt;already been spotted&lt;/a&gt; in the wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ds8kB5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Few things make you feel like you live in a bleak dystopian reality like a Citizen App patrol car that looks like a cop car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spotted by ⁦&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/magggggiiieeeee?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@magggggiiieeeee&lt;/a&gt;⁩ on the 10. &lt;a href="https://t.co/B7ppqymXSd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B7ppqymXSd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— brandon wenerd (@brandonwenerd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brandonwenerd/status/1395045423958478849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iYw4qs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s report goes further than that, though, digging through internal documents and speaking to former employees who describe a “privatized secondary emergency response network” that would respond to an app user’s request. So far, Citizen appears to have been contracting that work out, both to well-known private security provider Securitas and — in the picture above — Los Angeles Professional Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmyZss"&gt;Citizen confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it was at least internally testing a “personal rapid response service,” suggesting it might be as simple as an escort service users would summon if they’re afraid to walk home late at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFLHik"&gt;But the app’s history — originally launched as Vigilante in 2016 — not to mention the idea that this company is apparently willing to encourage its users to hunt down suspects for money, suggest that this move could be... a little problematic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClkCJz"&gt;Social networks and apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests"&gt;like Nextdoor&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon’s Ring Neighbors have already been roundly criticized for preying on people’s fears, encouraging them to report on suspicious activity in their neighborhood, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/18/ring-nest-surveillance-doorbell-camera/"&gt;normalizing surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, and unfairly targeting their neighbors based on their racial biases. Combine that with a company that might encourage users to take justice into their own hands, and that seems not great.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO’s Pause with Sam Jay turns the stuffy late-night talk show into a party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2XPuV-5A6Q4Y5c6mnW45TqNzZZw=/124x0:1461x891/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325147/sam_jay.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: HBO / WarnerMedia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLPdLD"&gt;There’s a quality that some long-running chat podcasts have that can feel like a brick wall for new listeners. Existing relationships, in-jokes, and context that friends and co-hosts have are additional barriers to feeling like you’re a part of the conversation. The casual hangout and chat format is tantalizing for its naturalism, but it also comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17832948/youtube-youtubers-influencer-creator-fans-subscribers-friends-celebrities"&gt;parasocial relationships&lt;/a&gt; as baggage. Which makes HBO’s new late-night project, &lt;em&gt;Pause with Sam Jay,&lt;/em&gt; so intriguing. It has hangout podcasts in its DNA, but it’s also out to reinvent a decades-old late-night format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ikxFf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause &lt;/em&gt;is co-created by Sam Jay, stand-up comedian and &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; writer, and Prentice Penny, showrunner and executive producer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16145498/insecure-broad-city-high-maintenance-web-series-hbo-comedy-central"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insecure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It feels fresh for some obvious reasons. Jay is a Black queer woman in a field filled with straight white men. But aside from the host, the format also feels unique. Where late night is dominated by monologues, desks, interviews, and panels, &lt;em&gt;Pause&lt;/em&gt; is quite literally a party. Jay invites over her real-life friends and fellow comedians, and they shoot the shit, filmed by two camera operators, while Jay guides the conversation toward the episode’s topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="muNQ7O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5zPy0VLxBM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08tuOV"&gt;For the episode I watched, that subject was selling out to white culture, or “cooning.” Jay and her guests think bigger than that, too, touching on the sorts of restrictions, labels, and classifications society can place on people who just want to be. The party atmosphere doesn’t always help communicate these ideas. Like a real kickback or house party, people shout over each other, ideas get lost in the mix, and jokes that play in the room just don’t translate without the context and history. But when it does work — or when Jay’s two white guests are gamely dunked on — it feels like something that’s never been available from this kind of show before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cja10n"&gt;This can make the diversions Jay and Penny take slightly frustrating. To support the natural discussion at the party, &lt;em&gt;Pause &lt;/em&gt;weaves in cutaways. There’s nothing necessarily wrong or unfunny about interviews, sketches, or man-on-the-street segments. But they have a very different vibe from a party, and the hangout atmosphere is what makes Jay’s project seem like a shot in the arm when you’re on its wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH3ELM"&gt;And it should! If Conan O’Brien&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/conan-obriens-tbs-show-format-change-explained-1108410/"&gt;switching up his format&lt;/a&gt;, shooting for a shorter length, and literally getting out from behind his desk can be a major milestone in 2019, then clearly, late-night television needs &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. In recent years, networks have turned to YouTube for inspiration (&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-late-night-ad-revenue-20150818-story.html"&gt;and extra ad sales&lt;/a&gt;). Segments on shows are frequently designed to be clippable and ready to be shared online, and networks like NBC have poached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20847627/lilly-singh-late-night-youtube-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers-nbc"&gt;successful YouTube talent like Lilly Singh&lt;/a&gt; to offer relevancy and audience instincts to network late night. Jay and Penny are obviously working the problem from a different angle — and from behind an HBO subscription — but the instinct that the old ways can’t be the only way is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4zaWa"&gt;One episode is not a lot to go on, but like the start of a great night with friends, there’s a ton of potential energy in &lt;em&gt;Pause&lt;/em&gt; (despite what the name might suggest). There’s plenty of avenues the show could go down, but the most promising is playing with the party format and building out Jay’s guests as sources of humor and insight all their own. For now, though, it’s fun in its own way. Watching people drink, joke, and play pool just feels more engaging than an interview behind a desk — especially during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hS9ccy"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pause with Sam Jay &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;premieres on HBO on May 21st at 9PM ET and will also stream on HBO Max.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I do not understand this chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVDeK5-Ff3m8sDc8T5hJIpTPS4g=/207x0:2103x1264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69325068/Screen_Shot_2021_05_21_at_2.12.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjR97U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1395447923463245824"&gt;It started with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Roadshow&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Tim Stevens. A picture of a chair that seemed to effortlessly skim the line between office chair, La-Z-Boy recliner, and Victorian throne. An utter affront to design, taste, and style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWUDDx"&gt;This chair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sZZa0W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Stumbled across this chair online today. I find its middle-management, aspirational evil overlord aesthetic oddly chilling. &lt;a href="https://t.co/0I41mxQNjF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0I41mxQNjF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Stevens (@Tim_Stevens) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Stevens/status/1395447923463245824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ALNW"&gt;The tweet first crossed my timeline yesterday, and my mind has been consumed for the past 24 hours by the very existence of this chair. Why does it exist? Has anyone actually bought one? Does the chair come with a menacing-looking cat to hold when spinning around to fire your minions? Are you required to shout “I’ll get you next time, Gadget?” when you encounter minor setbacks while seated in it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GyluF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Penn-Executive-Office-Chair-Reclining/dp/B08XQTF8SW/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Wood+Executive+Chair&amp;amp;qid=1621612598&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Amazon listing&lt;/a&gt;, however, only added to the perplexing nature. The original picture, for example, did not convey the &lt;em&gt;built-in footrest&lt;/em&gt; that this relic possesses. It’s a fact that seems important, although I cannot quite convey why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLntpN"&gt;Another important nugget of information: the Penn Executive Chair’s price, a whopping $1,950, puts it above the cost of the most expensive office chair from Herman Miller or the cushiest, comfiest La-Z-Boy recliner. Then again, why shouldn’t a chair like this, which aspires to ascend beyond the limits of both of those products, feature a price tag that similarly soars above either of its lesser halves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F31is"&gt;(That said, this thing does feature genuine leather, the lowest grade of leather, a disappointing choice for something this pricey.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1F3YgZ04ccFgoLkxyCYQuNKvHdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531202/81lXq9NCVKL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgkpej"&gt;The main vibe of that image is “spikes and manacles are about to pop out of the arm and headrests to imprison a James Bond-style spy in a low-budget (or lowish-budget, again these chairs cost like two grand) thriller movie.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoCEvE"&gt;The rabbit hole tunneled ever deeper. I found the &lt;a href="https://www.pennexecutivechairs.com/"&gt;website of the manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;, Penn Executive Chairs, showcasing new styles of the dreaded chair in ever-maddening color schemes, patterns, and tufted leather backs. A second image — the only one I’ve found of a human sitting in one of these chairs — alludes to the scale, one that seems more fitting for a throne than a seat for an office desk. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L2uBKq2NtvXi8AXsRe5xQb2SODU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531193/66036e_bf709998d2394edfa837f70b02510ffd_mv2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYUVSaPpIJcQh-qr9zgpYnr85Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22531191/66036e_33d959332384427799fc704d1a52a770_mv2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Penn Executive Chairs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENJOY THE BUSINESS– NETWORKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsv0ES"&gt;I do not think writing this has helped me understand the chair — indeed, I don’t think it is possible to truly &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the nature of this item — but if a giant throne-like recliner shows up as my new desk chair whenever we all return to office life, this is why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PuVVN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
