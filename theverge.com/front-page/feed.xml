    <title>Some Twitter employees have reportedly locked their accounts fearing reprisal from Trump supporters</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnXLve"&gt;Some Twitter employees have set their accounts to private and scrubbed their online biographies over concerns they may be targeted by supporters of President Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/inside-twitter-decision-trump.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; In addition, some Twitter executives have been assigned personal security as the company reckons with its decision to bar one of its loudest voices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toSQFU"&gt;Trump’s @realDonaldTrump account was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently suspended from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; January 8th, “due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528?s=20"&gt;in its statement&lt;/a&gt;. The president &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/trump-speech-riot.html"&gt;told supporters at a rally&lt;/a&gt; just before an attack on the Capitol January 6th they would “have to show strength,” and “fight much harder,” encouraging them to walk down to the Capitol. &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/realDonaldTrump"&gt;Trump tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Vice President Mike Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done,” and later — while the attack was still ongoing— tweeted “we love you” to his supporters. The House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-impeached.html"&gt;impeached Trump&lt;/a&gt; a second time on January 13th for “incitement of insurrection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHnHFW"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times,&lt;/em&gt; Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who was working remotely from a private island the day the riot occurred, was not totally convinced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;a temporary ban on the president&lt;/a&gt; that day was the right decision. Twitter executives told Dorsey that the response to Trump’s tweets in the day after the riot suggested there was great potential for more real-world violence, ultimately leading to the permanent suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtS36p"&gt;More than 300 Twitter employees had signed an internal petition calling for a permanent Trump suspension, but according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the company had already decided at that point to ban the president. After Twitter announced its ban, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230001/snapchat-trump-ban-permanently-account-january-20th-innaguration-snap"&gt;Snapchat issued its own permanent ban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook put indefinite bans&lt;/a&gt; on President Trump’s accounts. Facebook said in a statement explaining its decision, “The risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service... are simply too great.” In addition, Shopify took down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt;, a main source of sales of Make America Great Again hats and other merch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFNWNn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510777254756352"&gt;In a tweet thread Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Dorsey said that banning Trump’s account was the right call. “Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all,” he wrote, adding that Twitter should “look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCWrB7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge Awards at CES 2021: can’t touch this</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/td7JOUzsXukYEWSKUEYSEV5aC8E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678256/VRG_ILLO_4375_TheVergeAwards_CES_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Rating the all-digital Consumer Electronics Show &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cGmKBk"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21058850/ces-2020-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget"&gt;we opened&lt;/a&gt; our awards for the annual Consumer Electronics Show by saying “oh, what a difference 12 months makes.” One year later we can confidently say again: oh, what a difference 12 months makes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfqJN6"&gt;It’s been a challenging year, and we weren’t sure what to expect coming into this CES. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to shut the world down early last year, events started to be canceled in a trickle — and then in waves. Scientists and experts told us the world wasn’t going back to normal for possibly years, so there was no way CES 2021 was going to happen as usual. The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which runs CES, is optimistic the show will be back in 2022 — but that’s a big “we’ll see.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofGspv"&gt;But even without a global pandemic, CES was always going to change. As big tech companies have seized their own airtime during the last decade, the power of CES’s main stage has waned. And yet the show has hung on admirably — even if it doesn’t have the most important product announcements for stuff you can go buy right now, it still manages to give us some good hints at what the most important tech trends will be for the next year or two. That’s why, each year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;returns to that show to see every hope, dream, and excess of the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rc8HJ"&gt;This year’s awards are bestowed on a beleaguered, but not beaten, CES. We honestly strained to even find enough to fill our typical amount of categories. But all of the exhibitors did their best in a difficult time, and that’s all we can ask for. Traditions are important in difficult times, and, for whatever it’s worth, CES is one of ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLdnLo"&gt;Last year we said CES was “a lot of show with not much very substance,” and that’s on our mind again this year in a world where we couldn’t safely assemble for hands-on demonstrations. But distance makes the heart grow fonder, and we’re hopeful that we’ll see you all again next year in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6rXec9"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wA9S9bmWzrNg_tB-6J-yNzPimbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21866563/ENoXiV7WkAEiea5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xwbcwB"&gt;“Best” in Show:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9qIvG0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="y46fY2"&gt;This might be our least-flashy pick yet for “best” in show at the CES, but this is no ordinary year. Somehow, this little chip from AMD managed to be the heart and soul of this year’s show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQHgOP"&gt;At AMD’s highly-anticipated keynote on Tuesday morning, CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Ryzen 5000 series: a line of 7nm chips mostly built on the company’s new “Zen 3” architecture, which has already made impressive strides in the desktop form factor. (If you don’t believe it was “highly anticipated”, just go back and look at the YouTube comments for &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;keynotes, where everyone kept asking “when is AMD?”) There are eight “H-series” processors for high-end gaming laptops and five “U-series” processors for thinner and lighter notebooks. The headliner, the Ryzen 9 5980HX, has eight cores, 16 threads, and high hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loN7mU"&gt;Su made some big claims. She said that AMD’s chips will beat Intel’s top end in both single- and multi-threaded performance. She claimed that they’ll deliver excellent battery life as well. And she promised that Ryzen 5000 will power the best gaming laptops of 2021. Essentially, she said that she was unveiling the best mobile processors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sR916h"&gt;This award comes with some caveats. Obviously, we haven’t gotten our hands on a Ryzen 5000 system yet, so we can’t guarantee that these chips will deliver the performance gains AMD is claiming. The company has also faced some driver issues on the GPU side (which have improved), and it struggled to meet demand for its hardware last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVrtGB"&gt;But if there’s one reason to be optimistic about these new chips, it’s that manufacturers clearly believe they’re the real deal. Immediately following AMD’s keynote a barrage of OEMs announced AMD models, while some (namely Asus and Lenovo) basically indicated that they’re all-in on the chips. From heavy dual-screen gaming rigs to budget laptops for students, AMD is going to be everywhere in 2021. But most importantly, it’s going to be paired with Nvidia’s top GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZGt22"&gt;That’s a milestone for AMD, and it’s what makes Ryzen 5000 the most important announcement of this year’s CES. Where AMD has played second fiddle to Intel in the high-end mobile gaming sphere for many years, the winds are shifting now. And in the middle of a trade show famous for its abundance of flashy vaporware and lofty promises with no hope of coming true, AMD has released a product that’s not only very real, but also continues the transformation of the laptop market, and redefining of what gaming laptops can do, that began with Ryzen 4000 last year. It’s a tiny chip, but we’ll see its impact for years to come. &lt;em&gt;—Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G15 in Moonlight White faces the camera, open. The screen displays the ROG logo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WjPoquxm5iM9xJgAa7D9_FHCUEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230900/G15_white_03_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CmXgbf"&gt;Best Laptop:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NMs0pU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227383/asus-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptops-ryzen-price-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Asus Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="N7LwlF"&gt;Last year, we gave the best laptop award to the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. We were right to do so. Armed with AMD’s Ryzen 9 4900HS, the G14 shattered expectations for what 14-inch laptops could do. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt; that I didn’t see a reason to buy any other ultraportable gaming laptop when the G14 was running around — with nine hours of battery life, incredible frame rates, excellent cooling, a phenomenal keyboard and touchpad, and a starting price of just $1,049, it was the thin-and-light rig that gamers had been dreaming of for years. It was also one of the first signs that Intel was in trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8sEIy"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G15 wasn’t Asus’s headline CES announcement; the company didn’t spend much time talking about it at all. And it doesn’t look like anything new or groundbreaking; there are no foldable screens or RGB lights. It just looks like a slightly bigger version of the G14 and, like the G14, it will contain the latest chips from AMD and Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zd4ADV"&gt;But I agree with Asus here. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. And if Asus is able to replicate the massive success it saw with the G14 in a 15-inch form factor, I have no doubt it will be one of the best gaming laptops of the year — if not the best one. &lt;em&gt;—Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x3v5BHowtInc4_VzC5X3Gf5eZ6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22226965/LG_OLED_TV_Lineup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EiUIji"&gt;Best TV:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xC6wV1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;LG G1 Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="hnuImu"&gt;TVs face some of the fiercest competition at CES, which means that the “best” television in show usually blends a useful vision for the future with the expectation that people will actually be able to buy it at some point. Meeting that standard this year is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;the LG G1&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the successor to LG’s ultra-premium GX series, but this year it’s got a OLED Evo panel, which the company says is the next generation of its screen technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qm1jIQ"&gt;With Evo, LG is hoping to close the brightness gap between OLED and LED. The G1 also utilizes LG’s gallery design, which allows it to sit flush against the wall (which is good, because it won’t come with a stand.) It should also be pleasing to gamers, with four HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;Google Stadia and GeForce Now built in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0DhSIq"&gt;None of this is to say that we expect most people to buy this TV — LG’s GX series is pretty expensive— but the real excitement is for when the OLED Evo panels start showing up in other places. Not only does LG have its own C and B series televisions (though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224271/lg-2021-tvs-oled-qned-g1-c1-a1-announced-specs-ces"&gt;these were just updated&lt;/a&gt;, so we likely won’t see Evo in them for at least a year), but it also supplies most of the panels found in other brands’ OLED TVs. And given that OLED is starting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;face some competition from Mini and MicroLED&lt;/a&gt;, it’s about time it started evolving. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iANXciua2LgbGGGZFzz4gu6bQLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22240103/UltraFine_OLED_Pro.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZYNwMS"&gt;Best Monitor / Display:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="fRwAjy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224922/lg-ultrafine-oled-pro-4k-monitor-ces-2021"&gt;LG UltraFine OLED Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="B3u1Ir"&gt;This year’s CES has finally made gaming monitors whole — with Asus, Acer and LG adding the HDMI 2.1 ports they’d been missing to properly support butter-smooth variable framerates and 4K resolution with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles. And yet, the monitor that captured our imaginations isn’t a gaming monitor at all. It’s an LG OLED computer screen that’s likely to have mind-blowing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1LPR4"&gt;To say OLED monitors have been few and far between is a bit of an understatement; for the past few years, the only OLEDs marketed as monitors have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20811828/dell-alienware-55-oled-gaming-monitor-release-date-pricing"&gt;basically been gigantic 55-inch TVs&lt;/a&gt; housed in monitor-esque frames, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1486434-REG%2Fasus_21_6_proart_pq22uc_4k.html%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F16%2F22231489%2Fces-2021-verge-awards-best-laptop-tv-tech-pc-concept-gadget#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small portable display&lt;/a&gt; for colorist work. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20909422/dell-xps-15-7590-2019-review-oled-core-i9-specs-features-price"&gt;15-inch OLED laptops&lt;/a&gt; were also sometimes a thing... if you were willing to sacrifice battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAuvGG"&gt;But now, we can look forward to a full-sized 31.5-inch 4K OLED desktop display that boasts 99 percent DCI-P3 and 99 percent Adobe RGB coverage, one that’ll charge up your laptop with 90 watts of USB-C PD power at the same time, plus two DisplayPorts and HDMI. It’s got three USB ports you can use to share a keyboard and mouse with a couple PCs at the same time and — yes — a headphone jack. A 60Hz screen with no adaptive sync whatsoever probably means gamers should look elsewhere, but the 1ms response time might make games worth it for a few. With LG Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224137/lg-display-42-inch-oled-tv-panel-announced"&gt;also promising&lt;/a&gt; a 42-inch OLED panel this year, it feels like OLED might finally be coming to a desktop near you. &lt;em&gt;—Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3KjRX-efLPJe61wtmzLNC--d64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228416/hazelhero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GXnDe"&gt;Best Concept:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="iWmwlZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Razer Project Hazel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="XJCIzN"&gt;CES is always full of wild concepts that are unconnected from reality, but this year we have to give it up for something that’s a literal sign of the times: Razer’s Project Hazel face mask. Let’s be clear: at this point it’s as good as vaporware in the fight against COVID-19, and we’re not expecting this (likely very expensive) gadget to be a real factor in fighting the pandemic. But seems to solve some real problems folks have with masks while managing to look awesome, so we’re awarding some points to Razer for trying something other than making sick gaming mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czfZKc"&gt;Razer still needs to prove that its disposable, rechargeable ventilators can keep you and others safe, and we’re quite skeptical: the mask doesn’t yet have authorization or certification from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But the Project Hazel mask is an undeniably appealing concept. It’s transparent, with auto-activating lights to illuminate your lips when it’s dark outside. Plus, it uses microphones and amplifiers to boost your voice, so you don’t sound muffled. For anyone who works in-person with others, it seems like a useful device to make communicating through a mask seem more natural. And while it’s upsetting to think about, it can’t hurt to be more prepared for the next pandemic. &lt;em&gt;—Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bot Handy" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLBaURj8WTjZO12BzayHh-H7o_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227356/bot_handy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R3mbpE"&gt;Best Robot:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="kFSCCU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224649/samsung-bot-handy-care-robots-ces-2021"&gt;Samsung Handy Bot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="W3KkJQ"&gt;I argued unsuccessfully to make this friendly robot our “best” in show pick, and I probably would have gotten away with it if not for the fact that Samsung churns out unattainable robot concepts almost every year at CES. Still, plenty of us at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;made the most noise this year while cooing at the Handy bot, who just wants your dishes to be clean and your meat-based body to be well-hydrated. Samsung is getting better and better at making robots look friendly, even now, when they’re sporting &lt;s&gt;killer robot appendages&lt;/s&gt; dexterous digits. It was a hard year, and I welcome the idea of a new friend who’s unaffected by human frailties. &lt;em&gt;—TC Sottek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FxwAqV"&gt;Most Unnecessary Use of Pods:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="us24bN"&gt;A great pod is two things: mildly convenient, and ludicrously unnecessary. This year, the runaway winner for Most Unnecessary Use of Pods went to ColdSnap, which makes a large countertop appliance that turns the contents of tall aluminum cans into soft serve ice cream. They’re among the largest pods we’ve ever seen, and their innovation — on-demand ice cream at home — is something we’ve all been enjoying since the invention of home freezers. &lt;em&gt;—Jake Kastrenakes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="USHElp"&gt;Best CES Innovation:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Ew5QPj"&gt;The 30-Minute Keynote&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4AqK54"&gt;For this year’s “all-digital CES,” some official exhibitors were limited to 30-minute presentations. And I have to say: this is one of the best innovations we’ve ever seen at CES. While this kind of time limit may have prevented us from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3850056/qualcomms-insane-ces-2013-keynote-pictures-tweets"&gt;experiencing the greatest technology keynote of all time&lt;/a&gt;, that’s a small price to pay for constraining the snoozeworthy excesses of corporate suits who could not deliver a joke properly even if given thousands of hours of training in a virtual joke simulation machine. All keynotes from tech companies should now have a 30-minute limit unless they receive the express written consent of the National Keynote League. &lt;em&gt;—TC Sottek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Xq7A6y"&gt;A good bath sounds really nice right now.

With just your voice, you can turn on the water, set the temperature, change the colors of the lights around the tub, and even activate fog and aromatherapy. Sadly, I don’t have an extra $16,000 lying around to buy Kohler’s new tub, but I’m sure it will be coming soon to the feed of an Instagram influencer near you. &lt;em&gt;—Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="UHEdhm"&gt;We weren’t able to touch much of anything for CES this year, but we can almost feel this laptop from MSI just by looking at it. The MSI GE76 Raider Dragon Edition Tiamat (yes that’s the real name) features an engraved, stone-like design on its lid, with a dragon and circular patterns that might not be accurate to Mesopotamian stonework, but are certainly cool if you’re in the mood. Sure, the device features Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3000 graphics cards, and high-end 10th gen Intel processors, but props to MSI for looking back to 3100 BC for laptop names. The company says it chose the name for the “supreme power” that Tiamat the goddess and Tiamat the laptop represent, and it’s hard not to agree with the decision. &lt;em&gt;—Ian Carlos Campbell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unlike Airbnb, VRBO reportedly won’t cancel reservations in DC during inauguration week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrhBGumhfZKm56bYYtL8W1zbZec=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678199/Vrbo_logo_dark.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;vrbo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wtLSps"&gt;Short-term rental site VRBO does not plan to cancel reservations in the DC area during the inauguration next week, even though competitor Airbnb has already done so. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/vrbo-wont-cancel-inauguration-rentals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, VRBO said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vrbo.com%2Fvacation-ideas%2Fexplore-vrbo%2Ftravel-trends%2Fa-place-for-everyone-leaves-no-room-for-hate%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F16%2F22234501%2Fvrbo-cancel-reservations-washington-dc-inauguration-airbnb-capitol#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; Friday afternoon that it was “encouraging hosts to cancel bookings during this time,” if they believed a guest was violating its policies, but stopped short of a blanket cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMarHa"&gt;Following the January 6th attack on the Capitol that left six people dead, &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/january/headline-891291-en.html"&gt;DC-area officials said in a joint statement&lt;/a&gt; that they were “encouraging Americans not to come to Washington, D.C. and to instead participate virtually” in the inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRIYRM"&gt;VRBO acknowledges in its blog post that officials were “reporting the potential for violence and armed protests” in DC and state capitals in the coming weeks. “The safety of our guests and hosts is of the utmost importance to us,” the blog post states. “If you plan to travel during this time, please follow local governmental regulations and check the latest news for updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6qbaF"&gt;Airbnb is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228798/airbnb-washington-dc-inauguration-reservations-blocked-cancelled"&gt;blocking all reservations&lt;/a&gt; in the Washington, DC metro area during inauguration week. Airbnb said it was aware of reports “regarding armed militias and known hate groups” that planned to come to DC to try to disrupt the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL2QhN"&gt;Existing Airbnb reservations were canceled, providing full refunds to guests, and Airbnb said it would compensate hosts — the rental property owners— the amount they would have made for the canceled bookings. Airbnb had said earlier it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227028/airbnb-block-capitol-attackers-returning-dc-gofundme"&gt;working to ban members of the mob&lt;/a&gt; that attacked the Capitol from its platform, and had banned some people who were either part of the mob or connected to hate groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arRs5F"&gt;VRBO did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch NASA test fire its massive new rocket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gn0HuaIa1IEoJYkR707cS6rCMzo=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678180/dsc_8766.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The B-2 Test Stand at NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. | NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eHD4WI"&gt;Four huge rocket engines will roar to life on Saturday, in a crucial test for NASA’s powerful next-generation rocket. This long-awaited trial run won’t leave the ground, but it will be so powerful that officials have warned that it may be heard &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAStennis/status/1349702841867395072"&gt;up to 60 miles away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRbgHQ"&gt;Saturday’s test is the last step in &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/multimedia/artemis-testing-sls-green-run-checklist-cropped.html"&gt;series of tests that NASA calls a Green Run&lt;/a&gt; for the Space Launch System (SLS), a powerful rocket designed to launch missions to the Moon and deep space. It will test the 212 foot tall core of the SLS, which consists of four engines, liquid fuel tanks, and the computer and technical systems that &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-to-air-hot-fire-test-of-rocket-core-stage-for-artemis-moon-missions"&gt;NASA calls the “brains” of the rocket. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EoZtuu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it will be so powerful that officials have warned that it may be heard up to 60 miles away&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ji30g"&gt;The rocket was originally intended to debut in 2017, but it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691230/nasa-space-launch-system-orion-artemis-moon-human-exploration"&gt;consistently been over budget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18691230/nasa-space-launch-system-orion-artemis-moon-human-exploration"&gt;behind schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Now, NASA will finally have a chance to see how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21057391/nasa-sls-rocket-core-stage-roll-out-michoud-stennis"&gt;rocket’s systems work while the four engines&lt;/a&gt; are firing ahead of the SLS’ first launch later this year. Engineers and technicians have already tested the core’s backup systems, run through dress rehearsals to double check-timing, and loaded and unloaded hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel ahead of the big event. Now they just need to put it all together for the first time to really mimic a launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f0D3PT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Om6zyUS1330?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2DRdD"&gt;“To be able to run a test like this, it takes not only a village, but small city,” said Ryan McKibben, the Green Run test conductor at Stennis Space Center, in a press conference. It will take six barges to haul more than 700,000 gallons of super cold propellent needed for this test — roughly 200,000 gallons of liquid oxygen, and 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7WiEs"&gt;The four engines themselves were originally built for NASA’s Space Shuttle program, which ended in 2011. They’ve been updated with upgrades including new engine controllers to get them ready to become part of the SLS. When the engines are fired, they will produce 1.6 million pounds of thrust — more than enough to send the core soaring. “When we ignite the engines, the stage actually will think it is flying. That’s what it’s built to do,” McKibbin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nxUnYt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When we ignite the engines, the stage actually will think it is flying. That’s what it’s built to do.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5apIwT"&gt;While the core of the SLS is built to fly, the massive test stand is designed to keep it firmly grounded. The huge structure is anchored into the ground with over &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/b-2_test_stand_v2.pdf"&gt;144 feet of concrete and steel&lt;/a&gt; that will absorb and redirect the thrust from the engines, McKibbin said. The engines will burn for about eight minutes — approximately the same amount of time that it will take to launch the rocket to the Moon on future missions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGNVV5"&gt;This is the last big rehearsal for the rocket before it heads to space, which means it’s also one of the last chances for NASA to get data on how the rocket might perform. The team plans to run the engines through the same thrust changes that they will eventually endure when they fly through the Earth’s atmosphere. The core stage is packed with over 1,400 sensors to help document all aspects of the test and gather data that NASA will analyze intensely over the next several days after the test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EbC6Y"&gt;“The reason we test is to uncover issues on the ground and not in space,” said Julie Bassler, SLS stages manager, at a NASA press conference this week. “We are doing everything we can to ensure that we get the most out of this hot fire test and we are ready to launch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uxgQfK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are doing everything we can to ensure that we get the most out of this hot fire test and we are ready to launch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZF98RV"&gt;If the test is successful, the core stage will be inspected and shipped to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, where it will be joined to other parts of the rocket and the Orion crew capsule. Sometime after that, the SLS will make its launch debut on the uncrewed mission called Artemis 1. That mission doesn’t have a firm date yet, but NASA is aiming for that launch to happen in &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11643"&gt;November 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s9tyT"&gt;Even as the SLS heads for space, it’s worth noting that it is not the only deep space rocket on the horizon. SpaceX is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;rapidly prototyping its Starship system&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, and the Starship design is being considered as a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-selects-blue-origin-dynetics-spacex-for-artemis-human-landers"&gt;candidate lunar lander for future NASA missions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3M650j"&gt;The window for the SLS hot fire test opens at 5:00PM ET, and coverage on NASA TV will start at 4:20PM ET. NASA’s livestream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The tech trends we saw kick off at CES 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nxGewQFvAucw_vrvtAtpmOMenN0=/0x0:3492x2328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68678173/hazelhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esfVQF"&gt;Another CES is in the books. Going all-virtual meant that it was a smaller show than usual — and since it was already a show that’s been on the decline in terms of influence for a few years now, we could feel it. Still: there were some big stories to follow and things to learn about what’s coming up in consumer tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqeEd9"&gt;That’s the thing about CES: most of the time the best technology shown off here is conceptual, wildly expensive, a long way off in the future, or all of the above. We’re interested in it not because we expect to find it in a store next week, but because it informs the things we’ll find in stores over the course of the next two years. Also, we’re interested in it because gigantic screens are dope, especially when they bend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFctxJ"&gt;This year I think there are a few big trends to keep an eye on. There are those concepts. But there was also very real processor news with imminent release dates. AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all announced components that could make up some very great laptops (especially gaming laptops). And then: umpteen laptops were announced that will use those parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZdUzq"&gt;And since this is CES, we saw the state of the art for televisions move forward once again with Mini LED and brighter OLED. I have to say with TVs in particular, I am gratified to see tech companies competing on straight-up picture quality via higher contrast and HDR instead of merely higher pixel counts and, I dunno, 3D or curved screens. There’s also HDMI 2.1 in the world and all the features it enables. Wait for reviews, of course, but my guess is that if you’ve got a TV with some miles on it, this will be a great year to upgrade and you’ll be stunned by the improvement in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okbcpx"&gt;Was there also a pod-based ice cream machine that people who like fun things enjoyed and curmudgeons like me grumbled about? Yes. There’s always a gadget that breaks out and gets more attention than we expected. The thing about this year’s virtual CES is that there were simply fewer to pick from. We had nearly as many big announcements as usual, but we didn’t have the odd corners of the show floor where we’d find diamonds in that very rough convention center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQaBZr"&gt;I know that’s not an experience that the vast majority of people get to have. For most of you, CES has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been virtual. But we’ll never know what sales deals won’t get made or wacky speakers won’t get attention because a couple hundred thousand people stayed away from Vegas this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUxRLT"&gt;Five years ago I was lucky enough to get the chance to wander the CES show floor with Walt Mossberg, just messing around with the stuff that was new back then. After you’ve watched the recap of CES 2021 at the top of this post, I encourage you to take a look at what CES 2016 was like, below. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I hope I can get back to the in-person show next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BC1uft"&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEzjZi"&gt;Millions of people in the US started buying face masks in 2020, and companies, unsurprisingly, rushed to take advantage of the surge of demand for a new product. At CES 2021, the gadget-ification of the mask was on full display. Leading the pack was Razer’s transparent voice-amplifying, light-up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;concept mask&lt;/a&gt;. AirPop promoted its &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wearables/airpop-active-plus-smart-mask-news/"&gt;Active+ Smart Mask&lt;/a&gt;, which monitors users’ breathing rates and alerts them via a smartphone app when the mask’s filter needs changing. Binatone’s &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/maskfone-integrates-earbuds-and-mic-into-n95-mask-no-more-muffled-phone-calls"&gt;MaskFone&lt;/a&gt; has built-in earbuds and a mic for phone calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3ajHx"&gt;Turning masks into a status symbol is nothing new, nor is capitalizing on a disaster to make a buck. Before the pandemic, people wore masks to protect from air pollution, and they’re fashion items in China and India. Also before the pandemic, companies making masks advertised for that purpose were starting to enter the US market. Last year at CES, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21050763/atmos-faceware-climate-change-technology-disaster-capitalism-price"&gt;Ao Air&lt;/a&gt; announced a $350 air pollution-filtering gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="w91RX9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IvHcxQ"&gt;Techy masks to protect against COVID-19 aren’t necessarily bad things. Health officials are doubling down on the messaging to cover your nose and mouth as cases surge through the country, and a sweeping review of the scientific evidence published this month confirmed, yet again, that &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118"&gt;masks work&lt;/a&gt;. Razer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it plans to work with medical experts if it ever decides to produce and sell its mask. Its concept mask has the dangerous and &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/cdc-says-avoid-valved-masks/"&gt;warned-against&lt;/a&gt; exhalation valve, but Razer says the mask would have a filter to block any virus exhaled by the wearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0ceD3"&gt;But a gimmick arms race won’t necessarily make masks work better. We need better masks for everyone, not just stylish products for people who can afford them. In the United States, nearly a year into the pandemic, most people are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"&gt;still wearing cloth masks&lt;/a&gt;, which are better than nothing, but not the best way to block the virus. Cloth masks were supposed to be a stop-gap until officials could scale up production of medical-grade masks, but those never materialized. Meanwhile, Taiwan is distributing high-quality masks to citizens, and Germany is requiring N95-equivalent masks in stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scf3xx"&gt;Without federal action on masks, people are left on their own to find and purchase them. There aren’t good criteria for cloth masks, making it hard to figure out which offer the best protection. There are counterfeit medical-grade masks &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/850d9e6834fc71967af6d3dda65ad874"&gt;all over&lt;/a&gt; the country. It’s a crowded, confusing area, and gadgets jostle for space alongside &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a34934223/slap-masks-safety/"&gt;slap bracelet&lt;/a&gt; masks and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fmarket%2Frhinestone_masks&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F16%2F22233507%2Fces-masks-covid-pandemic-capitol-antivirus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rhinestones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2mVbB"&gt;“We routinely get PR pitches for excellent new solutions as well as snake-oil remedies, and we sometimes have trouble telling them apart—how is an ordinary person supposed to evaluate competing claims?” Zeynep Tufekci and Jeremy Howard &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wrp9fE"&gt;To combat the pandemic, the US needs effective masks to be distributed as a public health service. Instead, masks of all sorts are seen and marketed as commercial products. Companies selling light-up masks aren’t creating this problem, and if the flash helps someone to put one on, it’s a victory. But these flashy contributions just highlight how far we still have to go before we have simple and effective protection for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL5wsO"&gt;Here’s what else is going on this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JiYo3P"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="beRMj1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/health/coronavirus-immunity-future.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future of the Coronavirus? An Annoying Childhood Infection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the pandemic ends, COVID-19 could gradually become more like a childhood cold than a deadly disease, new research suggests. With vaccines, that transformation could happen quickly. (Apoorva Mandavilli, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B2Kx2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/13/22224445/covid-19-deaths-in-us-hospital-beds-icu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No ICU beds? Expect double the number of Covid-19 deaths.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The death risk from COVID-19 isn’t static. It changes depending on the quality of care doctors are able to provide. When intensive care units are full, people are more likely to die from the disease. (Julia Belluz, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fO0ysD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/14/more-infectious-variants-could-make-things-much-worse/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid-19 deaths are the highest they’ve ever been — and the more infectious variants could make things much worse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new coronavirus strain gaining a foothold in the United States isn’t more deadly, but it’s more contagious. It’s a scary scenario anyway: faster-spreading infections still mean more deaths. (Andrew Joseph, &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CYcQVj"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5uQ9vr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22219362/end-of-covid-19-pandemic-social-distancing-masking"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you and your friends are vaccinated, can you quit social distancing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting vaccinated isn’t a free pass to act like the pandemic is over, but as people around you start to get vaccinated, life will start to return to normal. The transition will happen in stages until the pandemic settles worldwide. (Sigal Samuel, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

The company should release data on its efficacy later this month. (Berkeley Lovelace Jr., &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHk1WQ"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3oCyYY"&gt;I am angry that after I spent months carefully isolating myself, a single chaotic day likely got me sick. I am angry that several of our nation’s leaders were unwilling to deal with the small annoyance of a mask for a few hours. I am angry that the attack on the Capitol and my subsequent illness have the same cause: my Republican colleagues’ inability to accept facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk1FAQ"&gt;— Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/12/bonnie-watson-coleman-covid-republicans-masks/"&gt;writes in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after testing positive for COVID-19 following the Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="46XuC0"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1DFTkk"&gt;To the more than 93,604,952 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBcryY"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,003,885 people who have died worldwide — 390,809 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkEDsS"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 full development reportedly didn’t start until 2016</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s7P9Zg057JWux6iRTZJRM8B8BRA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68677887/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;A new report looking into what went amiss with the rollout of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; points to overconfidence from management at CD Projekt Red as a key problem, and reveals that “full development” of the game — announced in 2012— didn’t begin until 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="986r9F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-16/cyberpunk-2077-what-caused-the-video-game-s-disastrous-rollout"&gt;Jason Schreier of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; interviewed&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, and found that the game’s development was plagued by unrealistic deadlines and technical issues. The company “hit the reset button” on the game in 2016, but a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446960/e3-2018-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-microsoft-trailer"&gt;demo of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; showed at E3 in 2018&lt;/a&gt; was “almost entirely fake,” according to the report. The development also suffered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with programmers on the PC version and testers of the console version working separately from each other.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhqthJ"&gt;In the months leading up to its December 10th launch, reports emerged of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538525/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-death-threats-game-delay"&gt;Projekt Red staff working long&lt;/a&gt;, arduous hours to meet the launch deadlines. Almost immediately after the the release of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, console players encountered widespread bugs, frame rate issues, and other problems. Within a week of launch, Sony had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from the PlayStation Store and offered refunds. One investor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199768/cdprojekt-cyberpunk-2077-lawsuit-launch"&gt;suing CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt; over the botched launch, and earlier this week, the PC version of the game was available for purchase for almost half off its original price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfeB38"&gt;Projekt Red co-founder Marcin Iwinski issued a mea culpa for the messy release, saying that despite the generally positive reception for the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; the console version of the game “did not meet the quality standard we wanted it to meet.” The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229627/cyberpunk-2077-first-update-launch-cd-projekt-red-playstation-store"&gt;planning to release the game’s first big update&lt;/a&gt; within the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;According to&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, CD Projekt Red was still focused on &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; was announced in 2012. Company executives apparently believed they could replicate the success it had with that game in developing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk.&lt;/em&gt; And in a detail that didn’t make the final edit of the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; story, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1350329528019791872?s=20"&gt;Schreier tweeted that the game&lt;/a&gt; had changed significantly since it was first announced; up until 2016, he says, it was a third-person game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmvlqm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bATJkp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pN68n3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMxpeH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The deals are slow, but we got some exclusives for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2I18s6mxHdUMHXNwiNxIj9Jh9s=/73x0:858x523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68677778/slim_folio_pro_for_ipad_pro__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjwKED"&gt;Welcome to the weekend. If I’m being honest, this week’s assortment of deals was just as spotty as last week’s. So, to make it a little better, we’ve worked with some retailers to give &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers some exclusive deals. Looking forward, if you’re on the hunt for, say, a big 4K TV or a home theater system, we’ll be sure to include the top deals in our regular &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; coverage as the Super Bowl nears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ttmiti"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xKYG26"&gt;Save big on Logitech’s keyboard case for iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OawNd7"&gt;Daily Steals is giving &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a special discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech Slim Folio Pro keyboard case for the 11-inch or 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above). These cases connect to your iPad Pro via Bluetooth and recharge via USB-C. Both sizes have backlit keys, making it easier to see the keys in the dark. These are new with Logitech’s one-year warranty, but Daily Steals says each will arrive in non-retail packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48csqe"&gt;You can get the 11-inch case made for both the 2018 and 2020 releases (the large rear camera cutout ensures compatibility for either tablet) for just $70, which is well below the $120 price Logitech is asking on its site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="jbzxsZ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://fave.co/3bGqp2e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it here for $70&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELOGIT &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ILCvMp"&gt;If you have the 2018 version of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (it has just a single rear-facing camera lens), that case will be just $50, which is $30 lower than the current price at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="pd5SfU"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1616420&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Flogitech-slim-folio-pro-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-3rd-gen-case-with-bluetooth-keyboard#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it here for $50&lt;/a&gt; when you use the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELOGIT &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="uLP0pm"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PGb0u3"&gt;Google’s Pixel Buds are $30 off for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HdnebM"&gt;If you’ve been tossing around getting a pair of Google’s latest Pixel Buds, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Google/Electronics/Audio_Electronics/Headphones+Earphones/1389562"&gt;“clearly white” colorway for $149 at Antonline&lt;/a&gt;. These usually cost $179 new, and currently no other retailers are offering a price cut. To get this deal, input the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE30 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to knock $30 off the final cost. This promo will last until January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HssHs"&gt;FYI: If you thought “&lt;em&gt;what in the heck is Antonline?&lt;/em&gt;” I first noticed them as a reputable seller on eBay, but they have also been ramping up sales directly from their own site. Aside from the one-off deal like this one, it also hosts the occasional PS5 and Xbox Series X drop (you know, in case you’re still looking for one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ujvNgQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Oy4BiC"&gt;Samsung’s preorder perks for the Galaxy S21 are great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I09xte"&gt;ICYMI, preorders for the Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra went live yesterday. The phones will release on January 29th, but if you place an order ahead of then, you’ll reap some great preorder rewards no matter where you buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2jyJY"&gt;My colleague Taylor Lyles has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22225628/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-preorder-how-to-price-verizon-tmobile-sprint"&gt;all of the details right here&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll really want to check it out if you’re planning on upgrading through a carrier. The short version is that you’ll get up to $200 in Samsung credit to use on accessories, along with a complimentary Samsung Galaxy SmartTag to help you keep track of your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hwJPUs"&gt;Driving around a car that looks like it’s made from the fabric of space is now slightly more possible, as demonstrated in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53JclJwR4Po"&gt;this modified black paint job&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;DipYourCar&lt;/em&gt; applied to a Mitsubishi Lancer.  The resulting car, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worlds-blackest-paint-and-sparkles-make-a-car-look-1846066602?utm_campaign=Gizmodo&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, absorbs 99.4 percent of light, but features speckled luminescent spots that make it look like the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNEwQ1"&gt;The project required the use of &lt;a href="https://www.ko-pro.black/product/musou-black-paint/"&gt;Musou Black&lt;/a&gt; paint made by Koyo Orient Japan and the application of &lt;a href="https://www.dipyourcar.com/products/ztp-hypershift-pearls?variant=18006214148"&gt;HyperShift&lt;/a&gt;, pearlescent particles used to create shiny finishes on cars. After some tinkering with paint thinner, the final result is stunning, even if it is as fragile and impractical as &lt;em&gt;DipYourCar &lt;/em&gt;suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="czUbzg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53JclJwR4Po?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="El6946"&gt;The effect is reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813054/vantablack-ultrablack-black-material-surrey-nanosystems-carbon-nanotubes-science-materials"&gt;Vantablack&lt;/a&gt;, a light absorbing material made from carbon nanotubes. Wild applications of Vantablack are well documented, from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/museum-visitor-falls-into-giant-hole-that-looks-like-a-1828462859"&gt;cartoon holes in museums&lt;/a&gt; to other cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836806/bmw-x6-vantablack-black-paint-frankfurt-motor-show"&gt;like this BMW&lt;/a&gt;. But this project actually highlights one of the weirder aspects of the material. The rights to create art with Vantablack were granted exclusively to one artist, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anish_Kapoor"&gt;Anish Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;. Vantablack “requires specialist application to achieve its aesthetic effect” according to &lt;a href="https://www.surreynanosystems.com/about/faqs"&gt;the material’s creator Surrey NanoSystems&lt;/a&gt;, and Kapoor is apparently one of the few people qualified to apply it. Kapoor’s license and Vantablack’s other use in the military and aerospace industries have kept it out of reach of the average artist or car enthusiast, giving its visual effect an even more alluring quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jbzo6n"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Carbon nanotubes built this bizarre ultrablack material|67002" data-volume-uuid="ba4e0d671" data-volume-id="67002" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-985" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out this video for more on Vantablack’s origins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzM0yQ"&gt;The exclusivity of Vantablack has prompted &lt;a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/features/art/anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-vantablack-blackest-black"&gt;competition from other artists&lt;/a&gt;, and the creation of products like Musou Black, that get close to replicating the effects of true Vantablack. As you can see with &lt;em&gt;DipYourCar&lt;/em&gt;’s project, it’s more than enough. My advice is to cue up some &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXkegHyURbI&amp;amp;list=OLAK5uy_lOq4NjXU5q4EN0BTR67iTW7e_g_3qa5jc"&gt;appropriate space music&lt;/a&gt;, throw up a gif of that car, and drift off into the void of the weekend. You’ve earned it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FAA just greenlit this drone to fly autonomously without a human nearby</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M_P2zV5GXkbCaKih-dApmwwlImA=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68676737/american_robotics_drone.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOAbKO"&gt;In October, the FAA took a major stride towards letting increasingly smart drones fly themselves, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;letting Skydio’s self-flying drones inspect any bridge in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; for four years, as long as humans first verified those bridges were clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yUP9v"&gt;Now, the US airspace regulator is taking an even bigger step: American Robotics &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210115005587/en/American-Robotics-Becomes-First-Company-Approved-by-the-FAA-To-Operate-Automated-Drones-Without-Human-Operators-On-Site"&gt;says it’s become the first company&lt;/a&gt; allowed to operate drones without needing a human pilot or an observer anywhere near the aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oebkTp"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as big a deal as you’d expect from the company’s press release or &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s headline &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-approves-first-fully-automated-commercial-drone-flights-11610749377?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;“FAA Approves First Fully Automated Commercial Drone Flights,”&lt;/a&gt; because humans still need to be part of the equation: &lt;a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2019-0775-0008"&gt;FAA documents show&lt;/a&gt; that American Robotics will still need to assign a human to each and every flight, who’ll run through a safety checklist before takeoff and inspect the aircraft with remote tools. They’re not fully automated yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zEb3t7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.338%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/438185792?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NG7v0z"&gt;But after that, the company’s drone-in-a-box Scout will take over and fly the mission — and automatically halt if needed. The Scout’s box includes &lt;a href="https://sara.com/tasa"&gt;an acoustic detection system&lt;/a&gt; that lets the drone sense and avoid other aircraft; the base station can spot an incoming aircraft over two miles away and automatically force the drone to descend, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpwJxxsgPL-MQadptfHTZLzhNpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22239563/ScoutBase___Doors_Closed__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by American Robotics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ScoutBase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2OEIxa"&gt;The FAA’s also only approving this waiver for a handful of specific locations in Kansas, Massachusetts and Nevada that are owned by the company or its customers, so it’s not like they’ll be flying over people unawares, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL9eRO"&gt;As you can see in the company’s video for the Scout system, it’s targeting this tech at companies that want push-button aerial inspections of their own property — not exactly drone deliveries. For that, the FAA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408646/amazon-prime-air-drone-delivery-faa-clearance-approval-health-safety-alphabet-wing"&gt;a separate kind of certification&lt;/a&gt;. But the FAA does seem interested in what it can learn from letting American Robotics fly without humans physically nearby, as it explains in its justification for the waiver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hOJX1A"&gt;American Robotics’ proposed operations will provide the FAA with critical data for use in evaluating BVLOS operations from offsite locations. Once adopted on a wider scale, such a scheme could lend efficiencies to many of the industries that fuel our economy such as agriculture, transportation, mining, technology, and non-durable manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JrFzQ2"&gt;American Robotics previously had a beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) waiver from the FAA, but &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107_waivers/waivers_issued/media/107W-2020-01574_Vijay_Somandepalli_CoW.pdf"&gt;that one (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; required its pilots to physically be at a location for the pre-flight inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
