    <title>After years of following pro sports, League of Legends esports leagues are ‘finally free to be ourselves’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1hggn"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/27/17616532/overwatch-league-of-legends-nba-nfl-esports"&gt;competitive gaming has done its best to mimic professional sports&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20856826/nike-league-of-legends-china-lpl-jerseys-partnership-esports"&gt;players wearing Nike jerseys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406041/post-malone-envy-gaming-dallas-empire-fuel"&gt;big-name celebrity investors&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18516124/overwatch-league-esports-home-games-arena-stadium"&gt;ambitious plans for home-and-away games&lt;/a&gt;. But Chris Greeley, commissioner of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series — the game’s top professional league in North America — believes that esports has moved beyond mimicking existing sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ5szh"&gt;“We had this idea in the beginning that, because esports is a sport, and we wanted to be taken seriously, we should look like a sport,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The LCS looked like the NBA on TNT. It was great for validation and for investors and sponsors to look and say ‘Hey, this looks just like a sport, therefore this is an easy translation.’ But we’ve outlived that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuMOGJ"&gt;So starting in 2021, the league is making some big changes, both in terms of how it looks and how it’s structured. “We feel like we’re finally free to be ourselves,” Greeley says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mydPu0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People hate change.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hvsjtC"&gt;The most obvious change is visual. The league has a new logo — it’s a crystal made of the letters LCS — and a refreshed graphic design for broadcasts. Whereas the previous logo was a shield that wouldn’t have looked out of place in college football, the new one clearly represents a video game. It follows similar redesigns for the other top &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; competitions around the world, including Europe, China, and Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuXNA1"&gt;(Greeley says the logo has received a mixed reaction from fans so far — which was expected. “People hate change. We’ve seen it from pretty much every esports rebrand,” he says, adding “You don’t want [a logo that] looks like it came off of a can of soup. It has to be resonant.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vLuecY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Riot used tech from The Mandalorian to build Worlds’ astonishing mixed reality stage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1_NHNfECJTLdzvAFic0Ws6mI-PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232863/Logo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GpzdYS"&gt;The idea behind the refresh, he says, is to give the LCS its own distinct voice in an increasingly crowded field. “It’s not just about a new color or a new logo, but it really is about how we’re going to follow with our broadcast and our content,” he says. “You’re not going to tune in this week and see a finished product. We’ll be iterating over the next year or two, but I think this is a really great start.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bYLsB7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s not just about a new color or a new logo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ccBKgD"&gt;To go along with this, the LCS is also introducing some &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-lcs-season-updates/blte6f00fe5b287ffd5"&gt;major format changes&lt;/a&gt;, with a bigger focus on tournaments, including one to kick off the year that starts on January 15th. Previously, the competition closely resembled something like the NFL, with a slate of regular season matches culminating in the playoffs; the best teams then moved on to international competitions. The goal is to find a balance between the thrill of knockout tournaments and the familiarity of regular season play. “Tournaments are exciting,” Greeley explains. “The problem is, if everything is a tournament, if everything is meant to feel exciting, then nothing feels exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuDqnK"&gt;Despite problems caused by the pandemic, the LCS — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238268/league-of-legends-csgo-esports-leagues-twitch-viewership"&gt;along with many other esports leagues&lt;/a&gt; — experienced &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/behind-the-numbers-a-record-breaking-2020-lcs-summer-split/blt1654440fda7c9e6b"&gt;tremendous growth&lt;/a&gt; in terms of viewership last year. But the league struggled on a competitive level. At the annual &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship, North American teams were far behind the competition and didn’t pose much of a threat to the big clubs from Europe, China, and Korea. Much of the blame was put on the region’s developmental scene. Instead of encouraging up-and-coming local players, many LCS teams relied on aging or imported stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCGuXo"&gt;The league is hoping to change that with &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/article/2021-amateur-ecosystem-updates/blt69197d4426878cfd"&gt;a revamped amateur system&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of opening things up, so that the developmental squads for each LCS team — known as academy teams — are able to play in different tournaments against other amateur and college teams. This will culminate in an end-of-year tournament called LCS Proving Grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k78STK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJmsIBM6FxI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzUdCf"&gt;According to Greeley, these changes were in the works prior to Worlds — but the feedback was still welcome. “The criticism around the need for NA to make changes to develop players, that actually was satisfying to hear, because I knew this was coming,” he says of the amateur changes. “We hadn’t announced it, it was nearly final at that point, but we were just figuring out how we were going to roll it out. When you’re developing a solution, and then everyone stands up and says ‘We need a solution,’ and it’s done and ready to show, that’s actually a pretty good feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PptRH"&gt;2021 will also see the league continue to operate remotely. Typically, LCS matches take place in a Los Angeles studio with fans in attendance. That obviously hasn’t been possible during the pandemic, but Greeley says that this could slowly change throughout the year. The first step is to get the broadcast team in the building, and the hope is that by the time playoffs come around, players can be present as well. Viewers, meanwhile, will likely have to stick to watching on Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCAy3v"&gt;“We’re not rushing getting fans back into the arena,” Greeley says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Samsung’s Galaxy S21 compares to the iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus and S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a42mfjTQfo78ZYZAdJ6Zn12SBSs=/0x0:3197x2131/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667151/03_1_galaxys21_series_violet_pink_black_210107073008.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HssTzE"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S-series 2021 updates are here, and they’re debuting a little earlier in the year than usual. Interestingly, the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra represent slightly diverging strategies for the devices. The S21 includes some cost-saving measures, like a polycarbonate back, to bring it closer to midrange. Meanwhile, Samsung has pulled out any remaining stops with its top-end S21 Ultra, loading it with five cameras and adding S Pen support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1HFL8"&gt;To be sure, there are still plenty of flagship-level features on the 6.2-inch S21. Like the Plus and Ultra, it uses a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor (or 5nm Exynos chipset outside the US). It features the same rear triple camera array as the S21 Plus and is built with IP68 waterproofing. The S21 Plus offers a couple of upgraded specs not included in the S21 that you’ll see in the table below, like a slightly bigger battery. It’s also, of course, the bigger device with a 6.7-inch screen, but the S21 and S21 Plus are more similar than not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y9KhaOkFRzKf6jt6YvUBQEC_I0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231023/01_galaxys21_series_pinkvioletblack_201230060018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 Ultra, S21 Plus, and S21, side by side by side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jn5XTv"&gt;The S21 Ultra is another story — even at a glance, its flagship-iness is obvious. Its prominent camera bump includes two telephoto cameras in addition to a 108-megapixel standard wide and an ultrawide. It has a slightly bigger 6.8-inch screen with higher resolution, a bigger battery, more RAM, and a 40-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOeJ8V"&gt;All of this will likely make it more clear to the prospective buyer which Galaxy S21 phone is the right one for them. But how do they stack up against the iPhone? Take a look at a detailed spec-by-spec comparison below. Note that for simplicity’s sake, we left the iPhone 12 mini out — it offers essentially the same specifications as the 12, just with a smaller form factor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Samsung’s Galaxy S21 compares to the Pixel 5, OnePlus 8T, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-nsN2QRZn1i8r6N4lugCyJXZkM=/17x0:3031x2009/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667150/07_galaxys21_lifestyle_violet_201230074012.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BHZ84L"&gt;Samsung got its S21 flagship phones out into the world a little sooner than usual this year, and the Galaxy S21 base model will appeal to a lot of folks with its balance of flagship specs and a price well under $1,000. In this refresh of the S-series lineup it’s the best choice for value, but how does it square up against its fellow Android competitors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPnuYN"&gt;The OnePlus 8T, Google Pixel 5, and LG V60 are all highly capable challengers in their own right. Where the S21 aims to deliver a complete all-around package, some of its competitors have made tradeoffs for things like a bigger battery or a lower price tag that are worth considering. And Samsung’s 2020 models, the S20 and Note 20, are still solid options for now and will no doubt be offered with some attractive discounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7z6m"&gt;Take a look at how the Galaxy S21 compares to these competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 phones come with plenty of features — but not a charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tMlYAWrgwOjf4cGvYDKrfx8tgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667031/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4sDMU"&gt;It’s official: Samsung’s new flagship phones will ship without a charging brick in the box. The phones will include a USB-C to USB-C cable, but no way to plug it in to the wall. If it helps take the sting out of it at all, Samsung has dropped the price on its 25W charger from $35 to $19.99. If you don’t have a USB-C charging brick, or don’t have a high-powered one and want fast charging, you’ll have to add $20 to the price of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9XpMu"&gt;The fact that it’s a standard cable means that many techy people will have something kicking around that can charge it — but it’s not hard to imagine a buyer who doesn’t. While last year’s Galaxy came with a USB-C charging brick, the one before that didn’t — and it’s the people who don’t upgrade every year who are less likely to have a free USB-C charging brick laying around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdYK6HS-V1e74ca0LKyVWpYbr54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22234153/Eri_jZsXcAcUSv1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1349037682555572226?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This leaked image of the S21 Plus 5G’s box shows the potential slimming effects that not including a charger could have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7rWnUs"&gt;The writing was on the wall for the omission: last year’s iPhone 12s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;come without a charging brick in the box&lt;/a&gt;, and Samsung has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;rolling back the ads it ran poking fun at that fact&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also a move &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317304/samsung-smartphone-chargers-2021-cost-environment"&gt;that’s been rumored for a while&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll still be a bit of a sting the first time you unbox your new phone and have to use an old charger with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD3ENE"&gt;It’s worth noting that this isn’t all for naught — for every person who would actually need a charger in the box, there would’ve been another who wouldn’t have, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307463/apple-iphone-12-power-adapter-charger-rumor-usb-c"&gt;it’s always good to reduce the amount of e-waste that tech generates&lt;/a&gt;. It just seems like companies could've found a way to make sure that people who need the chargers would have them, or included compatible chargers for one more year to better serve the people who aren’t upgrading every year (by the way, isn’t that the most ecologically friendly path anyways?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Samsung website, which includes a picture of the phone and a caption reading “Galaxy S21+ 5G comes packaged with just what you need - USB Type-C data and charging cable, ejection pin, and Quick Start Guide. Just another way of being good to the environment.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jg55BlqEVlJS3XFxW1Vso-Y792Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233617/slack_imgs.com.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung cites environmental concerns, saying that the S21 comes with “just what you need.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ljbg21"&gt;Speaking of things not being included in the box, the S21 will also ship without a pair of wired headphones (except, presumably, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/21/heres-how-apple-is-shipping-earpods-with-iphone-12-orders-in-france"&gt;where it’s required to by law&lt;/a&gt;.) As with the charger, this is one less thing that will go to waste if you already have a pair of headphones or were looking to pick up the Galaxy Buds Pro, but it’s a bummer for people who don’t already have a pair and would’ve been just fine with keeping it simple. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how Samsung’s S Pen works with the new Galaxy S21 Ultra</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TPXpD8cjqgxASTxtfF6epuoFmo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667023/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jkJS2j"&gt;Samsung’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; supports the company’s S Pen stylus. Support for the accessory has been a staple of Samsung’s Galaxy Note smartphones for years, but this is the first time it’s been supported in the company’s Galaxy S-series. The stylus will be available as an optional $39.99 accessory, and Samsung says the S21 Ultra will also work with S Pens from other Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afNUJ4"&gt;As for what you can use the stylus to do on the S21 Ultra, Samsung has outlined a range of familiar use cases. These include drawing, note-taking, photo editing, and signing documents. Physically, the new stylus is a little bigger than previous Galaxy Note S Pens, but it retains the side button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HYOCCVWTy8lcO03r4hsUFCm19mQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233313/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra with its stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RdEXJg"&gt;Unlike Galaxy Note phones, the Galaxy S21 Ultra doesn’t have a built-in slot for storing the stylus. Instead, Samsung is selling cases with S Pen carrying slots, which cost $69.99 when bundled with the stylus. Having to use a case to carry the accessory doesn’t sound as convenient as being able to slot it in the phone directly, but it’s a compromise given there’ll be plenty of Galaxy S21 Ultra owners who won’t bother with the optional accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDp54E"&gt;In the new lineup, stylus support is exclusive to the Galaxy S21 Ultra. You won’t be able to use an S Pen with either the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEPyMe"&gt;Rumors of the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s stylus support have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;around since last year&lt;/a&gt;, and the feature was essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;confirmed in an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; at the end of December. Now that the Galaxy S series is inheriting one of the Note series’s biggest features, there are rumors that the latter could be discontinued. However, this has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;reportedly been disputed&lt;/a&gt; by one Samsung official.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag is a $29.99 Tile competitor </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYSsXWTb8bv7LwYvOLnEfHPHX3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667022/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FwK9H7"&gt;Alongside the new Galaxy S21 phones and Galaxy Buds Pro, Samsung is announcing a small Bluetooth gadget you can use for locating lost items, just like Tile. It’s called the Galaxy SmartTag, and it will ship beginning on January 29th. It will retail for $29.99, but there’s a decent chance that people who buy a Galaxy S21 phone will end up with some sort of bundled deal that gets it included with purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DscW7F"&gt;The Galaxy SmartTag works much like a Tile tracker. It’s a small Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) dongle you attach via a key ring. It pairs with a smartphone via Samsung’s SmartThings app, which can show its last known location on a map. When you’re searching for the tag, the SmartThings app can show a proximity indicator depending on the strength of the BLE signal, and you can tap a button to make the tag emit a chime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwYVpW"&gt;One strange decision, though: Samsung tells me the SmartTag will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; work with Samsung Galaxy devices. It will not work if you have another Android phone or an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ab_CwBB8alpg1qWMVSNvKCzDcBE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231217/Screen_Shot_2021_01_12_at_1.40.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gmh8BW"&gt;Unlike the rumored AirTags from Apple or the rumored next-gen Tile tracker, Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag doesn’t support Ultra Wideband (UWB). One of UWB’s features is helping objects locate each other in space, so you’d get more data than a proximity meter. It’s a weird miss, too, because Samsung has been including UWB in its phones but hasn’t yet done much to take advantage of that radio (and neither, it should be said, has Apple). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiRBLR"&gt;Samsung says that a UWB version of the device, called Tag+, will arrive later this year. It will cost $39.99. Both the regular Tag and the Tag+ will be available in multipacks that provide a discount on the cost per tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0UltsG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r26JHAOtVSc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VSxQnS"&gt;The biggest potential loser in all this is Tile, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;already accused Apple of engaging in anti-competitive behavior&lt;/a&gt;. With Samsung also making a directly competitive product, it could put even more pressure on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TD6tqt"&gt;Once upon a time, all Bluetooth headphones worked about the same no matter what phone you used, but lately, both Apple and Samsung have enabled custom features if you buy one of their headphones. It seems possible that the same trend could apply to tracking devices in the not-too-distant future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Galaxy Buds Pro, its most premium earbuds yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8yieDFz5hbCm0symQREM1Ryhas=/0x34:1682x1155/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667019/BudsPro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xOCcBb"&gt;Samsung is announcing the $199.99 Galaxy Buds Pro today, its most premium set of true wireless earbuds yet. They feature an in-ear design similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; but are aesthetically inspired by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. The Buds Pro aren’t bean-shaped, but they’ve got the same metallic-looking style and a similar charging case. The tweaked design “reduces the contact area between your ear and the bud, improving comfort and minimizing any clogged-up feeling,” according to Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5x7Rk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6JYT7L0Dwk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nErj8y"&gt;More important is that Samsung says they deliver the “best audio experience yet” of any of the company’s earbuds thanks to an 11mm woofer and 6.5mm tweeter. The active noise cancellation should also be much improved since these earbuds now create a full seal with your ear. Samsung has also refined its ambient sound mode, which now lets you &lt;em&gt;amplify&lt;/em&gt; surrounding noise by up to 20 decibels. The Galaxy Buds Pro are able to detect when you’ve started speaking, and they can automatically switch into ambient sound mode and lower music volume when you do. We’ve seen this convenient trick on headphones like the Sony 1000XM4, but it’s still relatively rare in earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NIKP-EzjOckc2tEQFhMwV9yG08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233208/budspro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e3HVfR"&gt;Samsung says the Galaxy Buds Pro also offer the best microphone performance yet from the earbuds lineup; they’ve got three built-in microphones and a voice pickup unit to help you come through clearly on phone and video calls. “One of the outer microphones also has a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rating, further eliminating background noises,” the company said in its press release. “In addition, Samsung has integrated its new Wind Shield technology into the Galaxy Buds Pro. While a less protrusive shape minimizes the wind contact area, specially designed chamber with mesh filters out wind interference.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQ21fmItS8rb8jj8Ak3SGPMRtIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233203/budswater.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro offer excellent IPX7 water resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYSDKW"&gt;Some features of the Galaxy Buds Pro seem to take after Apple’s AirPods Pro: there’s 360 audio “featuring Dolby Head Tracking technology” when watching videos on a Samsung phone or tablet — a clear answer to Apple’s spatial audio. And the Buds Pro will also switch between Samsung mobile devices automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rtsiq"&gt;Battery life is about on par with other premium ANC earbuds: Samsung says you can expect up to five hours of continuous playback with noise canceling enabled (eight if it’s off), and enough juice in the case for an additional 13 hours (20 hours with ANC off) of listening time. The Galaxy Buds Pro are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance, so they should be able to handle even your sweatiest workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUYh0Y"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro will come in black, silver, and purple colors to match the new Galaxy S21 lineup. You can preorder today, and they’ll be available from retailers as soon as tomorrow, January 15th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra first look: polished design (and prices)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ohf7aS0VQJIX1JrQynhe9j-YDms=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667033/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Starting at $799 and available on January 29th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Bcr1Iv"&gt;Samsung’s latest flagships are here: the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, and the Galaxy S21 Ultra. The first two — which start at $799 and $999, respectively — mark some of the least expensive flagship phones that Samsung has made in years, while the $1,199 S21 Ultra aims to be not just the top-specced phone in Samsung’s lineup, but also the best phone, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vasZep"&gt;I was able to briefly try out all three devices last week, and they all share a new design language that throws out a lot of what I’d come to expect from a Samsung smartphone. The internal changes are more incremental from last year’s S20 lineup, though, and in some cases, they’re an intentional step back. All three phones will be available to preorder on January 14th and will launch on January 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrknfq"&gt;The new devices can effectively be divided into two categories: the S21 and S21 Plus, which are aiming to achieve a more wallet-friendly flagship experience, and the S21 Ultra, the ultimate Samsung smartphone that cuts no corners and aims to offer the most premium phone possible — with a price tag to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z8zSO8"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy S21|100092" data-volume-uuid="242ec3170" data-volume-id="100092" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-559" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uUOavS"&gt;Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wQ64gh"&gt;Unlike past years, the S21 and S21 Plus are almost identical devices this time around, barring the obvious differences in screen size, battery size, and one or two other minor details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1E3Mv"&gt;But the most important change with these two phones isn’t actually the hardware itself; it’s after years of creeping prices, Samsung has finally reversed course, with the S21 and S21 Plus actually starting at $799 and $999, respectively, this year. That’s a full $200 less than last year’s models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCtUH9"&gt;In order to accomplish that, Samsung made a few compromises in order to reach those lower price points. The displays, while the same 6.2-inch (S21) and 6.7-inch (S21 Plus) sizes as last year’s models, have dropped the subtly curved edges that have been a Samsung hallmark for years. Those flat panel screens also feature a step down in resolution from the 3200 x 1440 panels on last year’s models to a more modest 2400 x 1080 resolution. Both phones still offer 120Hz refresh rates, although it’s dynamically adjusted now. Lastly, the RAM has also been dropped from 12GB to 8GB. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/186Qtt86WK6nB5BfKlTL1m8FVvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232929/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus (left) and Galaxy S21 (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1zkIHr"&gt;The smaller Galaxy S21 makes additional trade-offs: the back panel is made of polycarbonate plastic, not aluminum, and it lacks an ultra-wideband radio (which the S21 Plus and Ultra offer for better integration with Samsung’s new Galaxy SmartTag.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtYrhs"&gt;Lastly, Samsung is following in Apple’s footsteps by no longer including a charging brick or headphones in the box, justifying it with similar environmental reasons (although Samsung will also likely save a few dollars by not bundling those parts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dh92Gr"&gt;The big question is: are those admittedly small changes worth the $200 price cuts? We’ll have to wait until we can put the new S21 and S21 Plus through their paces in our upcoming review. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFe-VPqD3aWkiOZKXv6ArfBcTUA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232921/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dKXfsR"&gt;It’s not all downgrades, however: the processor is Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 chipset, which promises big improvements in overall performance. There’s comprehensive 5G integration on both devices, with support for mmWave and sub-6GHz networks. The fingerprint sensor has been upgraded to Qualcomm’s new 3D Sonic Sensor Gen 2, which should be faster and easier to use. And the batteries are still big: the S21 still offers a beefy 4,000mAh battery, and the S21 Plus has been upgraded to an even larger 4,800mAh one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSt4QD"&gt;But the biggest update this year is the new design, which ditches the glass-slab sandwich that Samsung’s been using for years for an updated look. And it’s easily my favorite thing about the new phones. After years of dealing with the protruding camera bumps that have been the de facto cost of offering bigger sensors and better lenses on our smartphones, the S21 and S21 Plus embrace the camera bump instead of trying to work around it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW1DZw2s8CszwwLruPWVY8PPGyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232924/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ya477yPE5nhznTuwoIoqHL25jbc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232931/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMSm12v55xWzjOz-aJfp052Narg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232920/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Plus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7ZVWo"&gt;The S21 and S21 Plus still have camera bumps, but they look good as seamless pieces of metal that flow out naturally from the matching sides of the phones, with smooth edges and spiffy two-tone designs that look really nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzyCMU"&gt;Largely unchanged from last year, though, is the camera system itself. Both the S21 and S21 Plus offer a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens, along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera. (The S21 Plus no longer has a depth sensor.) If those sound similar, it’s because the hardware is virtually identical to the cameras found on last year’s Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus phones. Samsung has made some improvements on the software side of things, including the 30x “Space Zoom” mode, a new “Director’s View” mode for video that makes it easy to swap between lenses while filming, and additions to Samsung’s “Single Take” mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSpguD"&gt;Samsung has told us that it will no longer over-smooth faces by default, instead making it an option. It’s high time that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQ0IYBxvlbiKR_MsSYaoiVtoPgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233312/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra, with S Pen and case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XUq3vN"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dd9LV2"&gt;If the S21 and S21 Plus are more restrained steps back in smartphone design, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a phone that imagines what it would look like if you never had to make any compromises. It’s a phone that promises the very best of what Samsung’s hardware and Android can offer — if you’re willing to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M8tJB"&gt;Starting at $1,199 (a price that doesn’t include any extras like an S Pen stylus or a case), the S21 Ultra is Samsung’s third superlatively named phone, the successor to last year’s S20 Ultra. And it has a lot in common with the original, including a massive screen, a 108-megapixel camera, and top-of-the-line specs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKLqix"&gt;But the S21 Ultra is a more refined version of last year’s model, one that looks to smooth out some of the sharp edges for a better experience — literally, in some cases, thanks to Samsung’s new rounded design language (which is similar to the S21 and S21 Plus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMPRS-gX4duxcdGclOLU06cKzNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233310/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZFJi11aO2QYYkS4ivp8fF5cVP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233318/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uVjfvZ"&gt;Looking at the spec sheet, the S21 Ultra checks almost every box: a 6.8-inch 3200 x 1440 OLED display, with refresh rates up to 120Hz (a refresh rate the S21 Ultra can hit at full resolution, unlike last year). There’s 12GB of RAM, a 5,000mAh battery, up to 512GB of storage, and Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 888 processor. It’s hard to imagine Samsung cramming more in here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGPnxT"&gt;Of course, just because Samsung can’t fit it into the phone doesn’t mean it’s done adding features. The S20 Ultra will be the first Galaxy S phone to support Samsung’s S Pen stylus, which does S Pen things. If you’ve used a Galaxy Note recently, you’ll have a good idea of what to expect. The only quibble: the stylus isn’t included in the box with your $1,199-plus phone: it’ll cost an extra $40, or $70 in a bundle that includes a case that can store both the phone and the stylus. And those cases are pretty bulky, adding extra width to an already pretty big phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1fJYPTkfuKz2n_hkJlD-KKe9uo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233315/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah66N0"&gt;And then there are the cameras. The S20 Ultra’s camera tried to shoot for the moon, with its 108-megapixel sensor and 100x zoom mode that promised photography that could live up to the “ultra” moniker of the rest of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u27L7L"&gt;The technology was incredibly cool, but it had plenty of issues. The S21 Ultra promises to offer a more refined experience for the second time around: the camera has a new focal length for slightly wider shots, a new laser autofocus system (similar to the Note 20 Ultra) that should help with the focusing issues on last year’s model, support for 12-bit color depth, and a more refined demosaicing process. Samsung is also working to give users more control over things like its AI-based photo enhancements, allowing you to adjust the level of smoothing, for example. Whether that’s all enough to solve the issues of the original is something that will require further testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6f9jF"&gt;The S21 Ultra isn’t just about that big 108-megapixel sensor, though. It also has an additional three rear cameras. There is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, of course. Then there is not one but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; separate 10-megapixel telephoto cameras: one with a 3X zoom and one with 10X zoom, which Samsung says is designed to give users more flexibility in how they approach shots. The downside of all those added sensors is that it expands the camera array to almost twice as wide as the regular S21 and S21 Ultra models, which spoils the look a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGrZtm1pLAsx2jJyW9c6328_C-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232923/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Yv4rEt"&gt;The Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra are a more deliberate lineup than Samsung’s past offerings. It’s a balancing act: with one hand, the devices show that Samsung has started to internalize the idea that not every phone needs every aspect of its spec sheet ramped up to the absolute max; with the other, it offers the Galaxy S21 Ultra, a phone that does just that for the power users who truly want that kind of device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZEQIK"&gt;It’s a philosophy that we started to see last year with the $699 Galaxy S20 FE, an intentionally cheaper Samsung phone that aimed to offer a premium experience at a more affordable price. The $799 and $999 S21 and S21 Plus feel like extensions of that philosophy, expanded from a niche “fan edition” device to the most mainstream of Samsung’s hardware. Factor in the almost omnipresent Samsung sales, and the S21 could be the most affordable Galaxy S device in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHMNCu"&gt;For years, Samsung has focused on making the best phones on paper that it could. The S21 lineup feels like an attempt to make the best phone for the different needs of different customers, rather than simply the most excessive phone it can muster. It might be the right strategy in the midst of a struggling economy, but it means that its smaller phones aren’t quite as impressive. With the S21, if you want the best thing Samsung has to offer, you are going to have to buy the biggest thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwmGzr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra starts at $1,199. This article incorrectly listed the price in one paragraph as $1,119.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s refurbished Pixel Buds are $80 off at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="MfT2kK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21400695/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Google’s latest Pixel Buds wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; don’t go on sale often, but Best Buy has knocked $80 off their normal $179 cost for today only. The catch is that these are refurbished and only available in the white color. Still, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729328917697804696" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 is a good deal&lt;/a&gt; if you wanted to try these out without paying close to full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtdD6W"&gt;Best Buy cleans these models and includes all original accessories, but like buying anything refurbished, it’s a roll of the dice in terms of what condition your order will be in — particularly when we’re talking about in-ear headphones. You could get a like-new product with no issues, or you might run into a few issues like the folks who left reviews for these Pixel Buds. If you have a bad experience, Best Buy will swap them out for you if it’s within the window for returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pt960a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283614"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FhxH7R"&gt;There’s a solid deal happening on the 40mm-sized Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) at Walmart and Amazon. At Walmart, the model with a space gray aluminum case and black sport band usually costs $399, but it’s down to $339 for a limited time, presumably. Amazon is offering the model with the red case and band, as shown in the &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;review video above, for the same price. Other retailers are offering these colorways for $379, at best.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google completes purchase of Fitbit</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXBcssWgF-USIIGT1DtsnondlJQ=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666859/20200919FitbitSense5.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit’s recent Sense smartwatch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4B4AT"&gt;Google has completed its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/devices-services/fitbit-acquisition/?utm_source=tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=og&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_term="&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The news follows the EU’s announcement late last year that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval"&gt;approved the deal&lt;/a&gt;, after Google made a series of commitments about its planned operation of Fitbit and use of the its health data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0MrBR"&gt;In its announcement, Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh said the acquisition was “about devices, not data.” Emphasizing this point, he reiterated Google’s commitments about how it will handle the acquisition in markets around the world. These pledges include not using Fitbit users’ health and wellness data for Google’s ad tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpfaO5"&gt;Osterloh also said the deal won’t affect how third-party fitness trackers work with Android, or how Fitbit works with other non-Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VMdlIS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The acquisition was announced back in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyrHrc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/2021-update/?utm_source=go_mar&amp;amp;utm_medium=glacier&amp;amp;utm_country_code=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit’s CEO James Park welcomed the news, and said the acquisition would let the company “innovate faster, provide more choices, and make even better products.” However, he added emphasized that Fitbit’s products and services would continue to work across both iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmJ4xr"&gt;“We will maintain strong data privacy and security protections, giving you control of your data and staying transparent about what we collect and why,” Park said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfcI0S"&gt;It was data concerns like these that have prompted regulators around the world to investigate the deal. Late last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22158271/googles-fitbit-deal-eu-regulator-approval"&gt;EU regulators gave the deal their approval&lt;/a&gt;, completing an investigation they began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353947/google-fitbit-acquisition-eu-investigation-antitrust-health-tracking-data"&gt;back in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqsKYU"&gt;The approval came with a number of conditions, including that Google cannot use Fitbit data from users in the European Economic Area (EEA) such as GPS and health data for ad targeting. As part of the approval, EEA users must also be able to opt-out of having their health and wellness data shared with other Google services, and Google has agreed to continue to support third-party wearables with Android. Those commitments, includingf the option to opt out, will apply to Fitbit users worldwide, Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so that users outside the EEA can take advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JCUJu"&gt;Google’s announcement appears to have been made prior to the Australia’s Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) final decision on the acquisition. In late December, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/22/google-faces-400m-fine-over-fitbit-takeover-if-it-doesnt-wait-for-competition-watchdogs-approval"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google risked up to a $400 million fine if it proceeded with the deal without the regulator’s approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3B7Jyt"&gt;At the time, the ACCC &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-rejects-google-behavioural-undertakings-for-fitbit-acquisition"&gt;rejected Google’s proposed conditions for the deal&lt;/a&gt; over data concerns as well as fears that it could force Fitbit’s rivals out of the wearables market because of their reliance on Google’s Android. Although ACCC Chair Rod Sims acknowledged the concessions Google had offered, he expressed concerns that they could not be “effectively monitored and enforced in Australia.” The Australian regulator said its investigation would continue, ahead of a new decision date of March 25th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vw32bP"&gt;Google declined to comment on the record regarding the ACCC’s ongoing investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfDqHe"&gt;The US Department of Justice also released a statement on Thursday saying it, too, was still investigating the deal, and that it had not reached a conclusion prior to Google’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dByTkj"&gt;“The Antitrust Division’s investigation of Google’s acquisition of Fitbit remains ongoing. Although the Division has not reached a final decision about whether to pursue an enforcement action, the Division continues to investigate whether Google’s acquisition of Fitbit may harm competition and consumers in the United States,” reads the statement, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ceciliakang/status/1349730614958845953"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The Division remains committed to conducting this review as thoroughly, efficiently, and expeditiously as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJDcIG"&gt;Google announced its acquisition of Fitbit over a year ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement"&gt;in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when Osterloh called it “an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="737HxE"&gt;In his letter announcing the acquisition, Park said Fitbit has now sold more than 120 million devices across over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hM2Hud"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 10:13AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from the Department of Justice indicating its investigation into Google’s acquisition of Fitbit is ongoing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcFOFl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 10:41AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that Google’s commitments to EU regulators will apply worldwide, including the ability to opt out of data sharing. Also noted that Google declined to comment on the record regarding the ACCC’s ongoing investigation of the deal. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
