    <title>Google’s Android 12 update has been the rockiest in years</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gJdXwUYhlaEif8Ydo9DpPzXcSUM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384996/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From bugs to halted releases, Android 12 has seen an unusually troubled launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There are some unique complicating factors this year, but it’s the same old Android — the good and the bad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hLnFwe"&gt;Android 12 is one of the platform’s most ambitious updates in recent history, bringing a major design overhaul to every corner of the operating system. It has also been one of the rockiest Android OS launches in the past few years. Both Samsung and OnePlus paused the rollout of their stable Android 12-based updates amid reports of serious bugs. Google itself has addressed a laundry list of bug reports from Pixel 6 owners, just as it’s trying to convince them it’s finally figured out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;how to build a truly premium phone&lt;/a&gt;. What in the heck is going on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTkjK4"&gt;The short answer is that there are some unique complicating factors at play this year but also that Android is inherently a little bit messy — that just comes with the territory when you’re designing a delightful public park compared to Apple’s walled garden.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Despite a refreshed look and some appealing new high-end handsets, Android is still Android — the good and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NFObXS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zGyqPg"&gt;Android 12’s release started predictably enough with a formal announcement at Google I/O in May 2021. After that, the timeline looks a little different from previous years. A full stable release came a month later than usual, on October 4th, 2021. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro launched later that month with Android 12 pre-loaded. A handful of bugs were to be expected, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;Google’s December Pixel update included dozens of fixes&lt;/a&gt; despite Google having that extra month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKzuTq"&gt;Even worse, the December patch itself proved problematic as some Pixel 6 owners complained about network connection problems worsened by the update. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;halted the update&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/04/google-delists-december-2021-update-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;removed it from its archive&lt;/a&gt; to prevent manual downloads. When asked, the company didn’t offer an explanation for the problematic update but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;pointed to a statement&lt;/a&gt; that a fix is coming in late January that will include all of the bug fixes planned for the December patch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 owners are still waiting for the bug fixes initially slated for the December update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUxGBh"&gt;Google’s not alone in having trouble with its new OS. Samsung users in South Korea &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-issues-after-android-12-update"&gt;reported serious problems&lt;/a&gt; with their Galaxy Fold 3 and Flip 3 devices after installing the One UI 4.0 (Android 12) stable release, including flickering displays and bricked phones. Samsung acknowledged the problem and &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%ED%8C%81/4%EC%B0%A8-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EC%86%8C%ED%94%84%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EA%B3%B5%EC%A7%80-12-13/td-p/14321413"&gt;responded initially by releasing a fourth &lt;em&gt;beta&lt;/em&gt; version&lt;/a&gt; of the software to fix bugs introduced by the stable release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK2MKt"&gt;OnePlus’ stable release wasn’t so stable, either: its Android 12 skin was so buggy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;the company paused its release&lt;/a&gt;, like Google, after it was widely criticized. In a brief statement, OnePlus explained that the fact this release marked the company’s attempt to integrate its OxygenOS and ColorOS codebases into the same build “led to the software experience not being smooth” and that its software team “collected the Community’s feedback and released a new build of OxygenOS 12 within a week to deliver a better user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XpqlCV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the biggest OS update to Android since Android 5.0 Lollipop, and that was many years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r5oEEP"&gt;In each case, these “stable” releases were anything but, and none of these companies offered much detail about what went wrong. To try and figure out what the heck is going on, we talked to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, former editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, who’s well known for digging into Android codebases and discovering Google’s secrets. Speaking to the Pixel 6 bugs in particular, Rahman guesses that it has a lot to do with the unusually large size of the update. “Many people have called it, myself included, the biggest OS update to Android since Android 5.0 Lollipop, and that was many years ago. There are just so many massive changes to the interface and to the feature set.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kEJAy"&gt;He also suggests that Google’s commitment to issue a new Android update every year can make things worse when it’s trying to do so much, and the self-imposed one-year development cycle doesn’t leave much wiggle room in the timeline. “They started immediately after Android 11 was released to the public — and they have a hard cutoff date… After that, they just focus on fixing bugs.” Delay any longer, and they’d risk bumping into next year’s development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5arqlH"&gt;It’s also possible that the attempt to bring timely Android updates to non-Google devices wound up backfiring. Android phone owners have been asking for faster updates for a long time — outside of Google’s Pixel phones and pricey flagships, many devices face long waits for OS updates. Sure enough, the updates have come faster this year. Case in point: Samsung users are accustomed to waiting about three months after an Android stable release to get their finished One UI update with the new version of the OS, but this year, One UI 4.0 arrived just one and a half months after Android 12. But the way things have gone this year, many users would likely have opted for a slower, stable update rather than a fast one riddled with bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KpBnqN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus, by its own admission, faced unique complications as it attempted to merge Oppo’s ColorOS and OxygenOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oxxR5"&gt;OnePlus, by its own admission, faced unique complications as it attempted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merge Oppo’s ColorOS and OxygenOS&lt;/a&gt; at the same time it incorporated Android 12’s changes. That’s a recipe for bugs, Rahman explains. “Devices that are upgrading from Android 11 with OxygenOS 11 to OxygenOS 12 are having a lot of settings and features being migrated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V76dpX"&gt;To illustrate the problem, he describes a bug that some Realme device owners have encountered: users who restore settings from an old Android phone when setting up a Realme device would sometimes find the &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/cant-disable-night-filter.4005543/"&gt;Night Light setting constantly enabled on their new phone&lt;/a&gt;. This happened because of a mismatch between Realme and Google’s open-source implementations of Night Light. OxygenOS 12, he suspects, suffered from similar issues. “It’s those kinds of bugs that are plaguing this update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTYtaG"&gt;While it’s still hard to understand how &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oxygen-os12-oneplus-9-awful/"&gt;an update as buggy&lt;/a&gt; as OnePlus’ initial OxygenOS 12 release earned a “stable” designation, it makes a little more sense when you account for the huge challenge of merging two codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hw5WUE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no straight line from Android 12 to the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSzGYc"&gt;While all of these factors likely contributed to an unusually troubled release, the underlying problem is a familiar one. By its nature, Android is a fragmented ecosystem. There’s no straight line from Android 12 to the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9 — every major update sees handoffs between the manufacturer, carriers, and Google, all of which result in delays. Initiatives like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/12/15632552/android-o-faster-updates-project-treble-google"&gt;Project Treble&lt;/a&gt; seem to have helped speed up some parts of the process, but unless Google takes some drastic actions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;nobody can completely fix the problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rViwDT"&gt;While OEMs and Google push to get updates out faster, they’ve also made a push to produce more attention-grabbing, premium devices. OnePlus appears to be separating its “flagships, but cheaper” ethos into two different realms: “flagships” like the 9 Pro and separate “cheaper” phones a la the Nord series. Samsung is making a serious attempt to bring foldables into the mainstream. Google has positioned the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro as true flagships, with custom processors and a design language that’s more polished and less quirky than previous generations. This buggy OS rollout risks taking some of the shine off of the polished image these device makers are hoping to cultivate — in fact, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?s=20"&gt;damage may already be done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNT5vl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Pixel 6 Pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch in October that I can no longer recommend it at $900. Combined with the latest botched  update it's just been a bad experience. My SIM is back in an S21 Ultra til the next review.&lt;/p&gt;— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qBFeb9"&gt;It’s a shame because they’ve succeeded with the hardware. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;two of the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus’ ambition to create a true flagship competitor has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;a refined product that’s the genuine article&lt;/a&gt;. And this time around, Samsung seems to have succeeded at making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;a foldable phone&lt;/a&gt; that has captured the attention of more than just tech geeks. But behind the glossy hardware, the software experience can still be uneven at times. That’s easier to forgive on a midrange or budget phone, but it’s tough to stomach from a premium device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru4JHg"&gt;It’s unlikely, though, that this unusually troubled release will sway significant numbers of people to bail on Android; as painful as some of these bugs have been, they’re probably not enough to push users over the hurdles of jumping ship to Apple. Rahman thinks that in most cases, the ecosystem lock-in is too strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5k5rtS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;behind the glossy hardware, the software experience can still be uneven at times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zaz9Vh"&gt;“You’d lose out on so many apps and services that you pay for. If you have other devices that interact with your smartphone, you’d lose access to that, or that access would be diminished in some way. I don’t see it as a significant factor convincing people to turn away from a particular device.” Those barriers exist on Apple’s side as well, of course. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;Recently surfaced emails&lt;/a&gt; from Apple executives imply that iMessage remains exclusive to iPhones as a mechanism to keep Apple users with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ONg9Or"&gt;Apple has also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;its share of software stumbles&lt;/a&gt;, to be sure. But it’s generally a more predictable experience — if you’re willing to live within the boundaries of that walled garden. And there’s the flipside of Android’s fragmented existence: there’s no single entity dictating the hardware and software. In Apple’s ecosystem, you get what it deems to be the right features at the right time, and that’s that. Foldables? Maybe in a few years. A rainbow of customizable system colors? Forget it. Life is a little more interesting — if, at times, unpredictable and uneven — outside of the garden walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 bundles in-store to Pro members on January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eN2ioVcq2QU3reuVTBM5NjfS2AE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384866/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 will be available in select GameStop stores as a part of a bundle.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OF7ua"&gt;GameStop PowerUp Rewards Pro members still on the hunt for the ever-elusive PlayStation 5 may have another shot at nabbing the console. Once again, GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 bundles tomorrow, January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;The retailer has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its first special in-store PlayStation 5 sales event&lt;/a&gt; of this year will take place in select stores on Friday, January 14th. To participate, you must have &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22604013%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for $14.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhtI6"&gt;The standard PlayStation 5, which offers a disc drive, typically retails for $499.99. However, as GameStop will be selling pre-built bundles, you should expect to pay more than that. An &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;image published by GameStop&lt;/a&gt; also suggests the less expensive $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition could also be available as a part of a bundle, although this hasn’t been confirmed. For the unfamiliar, the Digital Edition is a console that shares identical specs but doesn’t have an optical drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8wssw"&gt;While we don’t know what will be inside the exact contents of the bundle yet, historically, these tend to contain PS5 games and GameStop gift cards, as well as other accessories like extra controllers or chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDJ0Rl"&gt;To land the console, you’ll have to visit a local GameStop store, which &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can find using the company’s store locator tool here&lt;/a&gt;. While the event will probably start at each store’s opening time, it’s likely many will start lining up long before this, so prepare to wake up early. It’s advisable to check if your local branch is participating in the event beforehand, too, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng6742"&gt;While this event is being hosted at several locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtABtw"&gt;If you don’t manage to pick up one tomorrow, keep checking back. We will continue posting updates as more restocks happen to make sure you will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are available right now for Walmart Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlNr08zeaUX12iagwr-22yVLtwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379557/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during today’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers and going on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Walmart is offering the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles are available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEO0nO"&gt;To ease the checkout process, make sure you have your shipping and payment info ready to go ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Degrassi show is coming to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O4bDX_ZkyCEN9H_jet-lSGisQdQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384781/Degrassi___from_WildBrain.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="33Fa1l"&gt;Hot on the heels of &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 premiere, HBO and partner WildBrain have just &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/warnermedia-kids-family-greenlights-new-degrassi-series-and-picks-degrassi-next"&gt;greenlit a new &lt;em&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; from co-showrunners Lara Azzopardi (&lt;em&gt;The Bold Type&lt;/em&gt;) and Julia Cohen (&lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt;) that the network is billing as “a reprise of the original teen drama.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXIxB7"&gt;Like the original &lt;em&gt;Degrassi&lt;/em&gt;, which explored the tumultuous lives of Canadian youths, the new show will focus on a group of high schoolers from Toronto who are all on different journeys of self-discovery. Unlike its predecessors (there have been five &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;series to date), which all featured half-hour episodes, the newest series will see &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;become an hour-long drama, indicating that its approach to storytelling is going to be a bit different this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eCaTf"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;technically kept on chugging for a few years after &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; came to an end in 2015, the franchise simply wasn’t the same, and in time, newer shows like &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Euphoria &lt;/em&gt;have come along to fill the teen drama-shaped voids in people’s souls. That being said, as much as many of the newer teen-focused shows owe to the &lt;em&gt;Degrassi &lt;/em&gt;franchise, few of them have managed to become quite as sticky and broadly popular as &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;was, and the network could easily have another hit on its hands if it plays its cards the right way. It will be a while before folks get a chance to compare the new show to the previous classes, but in preparation for the latest addition, all 14 seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;are coming to HBO Max this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFStwP"&gt;While there’s currently no word on any casting or the new show’s creative team, production on the new show is slated to begin sometime this year with a projected 2023 release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google calls for new government action to protect open-source software projects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fkFqJndLCHaPVbEwW2PRkJVf-0E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384741/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CLP9bx"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881813/white-house-tech-summit-apple-google-meta-amazon-open-source-security"&gt;summit on open-source security&lt;/a&gt; hosted at the White House Thursday, Google has called for increasing government involvement in identifying and securing critical open-source software projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekdxQd"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-open-source-software-safer-and-more-secure"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published shortly after the summit, Kent Walker, president for global affairs and chief legal officer at Google and Alphabet, said that collaboration between government and the private sector was needed for open-source funding and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToJ3Eo"&gt;“We need a public-private partnership to identify a list of critical open source projects — with criticality determined based on the influence and importance of a project — to help prioritize and allocate resources for the most essential security assessments and improvements,” Walker wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28MlyZ"&gt;The blog post also called for an increase in public and private investment to keep the open-source ecosystem secure, particularly when the software is used in infrastructure projects. For the most part, funding and review of such projects are conducted by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iC1YG"&gt;The White House had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8yZcG"&gt;“Open source software code is available to the public, free for anyone to use, modify, or inspect ... That’s why many aspects of critical infrastructure and national security systems incorporate it,” wrote Walker. “But there’s no official resource allocation and few formal requirements or standards for maintaining the security of that critical code. In fact, most of the work to maintain and enhance the security of open source, including fixing known vulnerabilities, is done on an ad hoc, volunteer basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXVPJT"&gt;The shortage of funding and resources for open-source development has long been raised as a security concern and has re-emerged as a key issue after the discovery of a serious bug in the Log4j Java library, which quickly became the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;biggest cybersecurity vulnerability in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. The Log4j library was also developed and maintained largely by unpaid labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMej4x"&gt;When open-source projects do receive funding, it generally comes from private sources like individual donations or sponsorship from tech companies. Google recently contributed $1 million to the &lt;a href="https://sos.dev/"&gt;Secure Open Source&lt;/a&gt; (SOS) rewards program, a pilot scheme being run by the Linux Foundation to financially compensate developers working to improve the security of open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We have so many questions about Boba Fett’s new job in The Book of Boba Fett</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nygfO5iuo6_hA56a_3Ff6YC9doo=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384665/BUC_035870_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nicola Goode / Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hY6YW2"&gt;The long-awaited Boba Fett spinoff, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, is roughly halfway through its seven-episode season on Disney Plus, which follows the iconic bounty hunter as he attempts to reinvent himself as “literally anything other than a bounty hunter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAzlkD"&gt;Yes, Boba Fett has a new job in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett.&lt;/em&gt; After killing off Jabba the Hutt’s former majordomo, Bib Fortuna (who, we’re told, stepped in to fill the Hutt-shaped space in Mos Espa’s criminal underworld), Boba is now the new “daimyo,” the lord and master of the desert planet’s seedier elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYkoe9"&gt;As we noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22858259/the-book-of-boba-fett-episode-one-recap-star-wars-mandalorian"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s initial review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not entirely clear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Boba Fett is chasing a sudden career change at this point in his life. And after a few more episodes, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett &lt;/em&gt;has left us with more questions about Boba’s new gig than answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbvfEe"&gt;Here are just a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLJSOS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;strong&gt;earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Tatooine would Boba Fett actually want to be the daimyo here?&lt;/strong&gt; Why would &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; want to run Jabba’s old crime empire on a backwater planet most famous for being so hot and uncomfortable to live on that farming dew is a great job and which has been best described as “if there’s a bright center to the universe, you’re on the planet that it’s farthest from”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atIcA6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How extensive is this criminal empire?&lt;/strong&gt; Jabba seemed to have much bigger reach — he shows up in the special edition of &lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt; to intimidate Han Solo in person in Mos Eisley, but &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; can’t seem to decide whether Jabba was a planetary-wide force of mob rule or just a dude who had the city of Mos Espa under his thumb. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRPzvdx0kx6c_LsNNbpGh5xBAcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166664/BUC_FF_001048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="90Fe94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Boba Fett so &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bad at his job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; For a character whose sole purpose in Star Wars is to be the baddest of the badass, how is Boba so bad at this? We’ve already seen him nearly die multiple times and make plenty of questionable decisions. Is this just the Star Wars version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle"&gt;Peter Principle&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTW9l5"&gt;Boba Fett’s introduction in the franchise is when Darth Vader hires him as one of the bounty hunters to chase down the Millennium Falcon. It’s a scene where Vader calls him out specifically that he wants Luke and friends alive. (“&lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/video/no-disintegrations"&gt;No disintegrations&lt;/a&gt;.”) He’s a man who &lt;em&gt;Darth Vader&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL8bVJhXCM"&gt;this guy!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qH1gey2aTw"&gt;the character that did this!&lt;/a&gt; — has to rebuke for going a little overboard sometimes. And now he’s taking shit from the mayor’s day planner, the guy who sells water in town, Jabba’s cousins, and the Star Wars equivalent of teenage ne’er-do-wells. Which raises a few more important questions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeivnx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does anyone respect Boba Fett in this town?&lt;/strong&gt; As previously mentioned, almost no one seems to take Boba seriously in his new role. His competitors don’t think he belongs, his constituents argue with him and question his decisions, and the city’s mayor doesn’t even want to meet with him. Things really hit a personal low point when we find Boba bartering with a bunch of obnoxious teens riding futuristic Vespas; instead of punishing them, he outright hires them. Not the most intimidating course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCtQfF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Boba actually do as daimyo?&lt;/strong&gt; For that matter, what did Jabba do? It seems like the job is mostly sitting in a big chair, listening to people’s complaints, and trying not to be assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ7tam"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people make up this criminal empire?&lt;/strong&gt; For the first few episodes, the crew of people working for Boba seems incredibly small. There’s his number one (Fennec Shand), an ex-torture droid, and a pair of Gamorrean bodyguards. We don’t see anybody else under his command until he hires the aforementioned quartet of mechanically altered teen troublemakers. That’s pretty small for someone who is supposed to rule over a criminal empire. And how does the hiring process work? Boba seems to just hire whoever he comes across — aside from Wookie assassins — with little in the way of due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Seksyl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Boba Fett just having a midlife crisis?&lt;/strong&gt; By the chronology of Star Wars, Boba is roughly in his mid-40s at the time of the show, which would put him squarely in the “early mid-life crisis” zone. Maybe this whole “taking over a criminal enterprise of indeterminate size that you have literally zero experience or capability to run” is just Boba’s attempt to add a little spice and flair to his life, especially after the priority clarifying near-death experience of almost finding “a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years” in the Sarlacc pit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0w_3sZaJAW9Rr79WsU5yQQB5uRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166667/BUC_FF_001896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lucasfilm Ltd.&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FF9Q2n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Boba just in this for health insurance?&lt;/strong&gt; Hear us out here. Prior to taking over Jabba’s job, Boba Fett was a bounty hunter, the Star Wars equivalent of a Taskrabbit or Uber driver, except they chase down and capture / kill / occasionally disintegrate(?) people for money. We know from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; that there’s a literal guild of bounty hunters, with bosses who offer a selection of jobs for these heavily armed gig workers to take (like Carl Weathers’ Greef Karga), but they’re clearly independent contractors with little to no corporate benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1O1xSs"&gt;Contrast that with the Boba Fett of &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;. Suddenly, Boba can afford a fancy and expensive Bacta Tank for healing up his Sarlacc-inflicted wounds. You’re telling me that he’s getting that kind of medical treatment on Tatooine with freelancer insurance rates? The deductibles alone would be ruinous. Between the Bacta treatments and Fennec’s cybernetic reconstruction, the two are &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; on some sort of group plan within the larger post-Jabba organization, and Boba, like so many freelancers, is just looking for some stable benefits to help manage his chronic injuries as he’s getting up there in years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PaAa2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Boba Fett even want to do this job?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s hard to get the sense that he’s genuinely enthused about actually being a crime lord. He seems to have no desire for the trappings of luxury, eschewing the apparently traditional palanquin for his trips about town and showing little interest in the lavish feasts put in front of him. “Not now, I’m busy” is Boba’s first reaction when his droid butler tries to pull him away from playing with his new rancor buddy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OeJGaB"&gt;
&lt;p id="9KKHqC"&gt;With four episodes left, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; still has plenty of time to try and answer some of these questions. But it’s possible that maybe the galaxy’s most infamous bounty hunter is just more suited to mayhem than middle management. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has to pay a trader around $30K for restricting trades on certain stocks  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSH2QdTWTh1i7f680IIfo2rj3JE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384388/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEAMVf"&gt;Jose Batista, a retail investor, was awarded almost $30,000 from Robinhood after filing a complaint using the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (or FINRA’s) arbitration service. His case may end up being an example for other retail traders who are still upset at the trading platform’s actions in January of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tm1fHo"&gt;On January 28th, Batista was planning on selling his stock in Koss and Express — but  Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;had placed trading restrictions on them&lt;/a&gt;, limiting the amount of shares its users could buy. This meant that Batista had to watch helplessly as the prices of his stock fell to nearly half of what they were the day before the restrictions were put in place, &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-27-year-old-truck-driver-just-became-robinhoods-first-big-headache-of-2022-11641856157"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Seeing it plummeting and plummeting, I felt horrible, and then I felt stuck,” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n78q/robinhood-trader-wins-dollar30000-in-first-of-its-kind-payout-following-gamestop-mania"&gt;Batista told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPx4ZE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s decision to freeze and restrict stock trading led to dozens of lawsuits&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9wA2U"&gt;Robinhood’s restrictions were thanks to the rush of trades happening around GameStop’s stock, which were in part driven by retail investors. In January 2021, the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248775/gamestop-stock-price-rise-bloomberg-wallstreetbets-subreddit"&gt;hyped up by users of the WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock rocketed up in value. This eventually lead to temporary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;market-wide trading halts&lt;/a&gt; and even seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252864/wallstreetbets-stocks-memes-broker-outages-limits-amc-gamestop"&gt;caused technical difficulties at several brokerages&lt;/a&gt;. That included Robinhood, which restricted trades on not just GameStop but other stocks such as AMC, Blackberry, Koss, and Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Es7KWy"&gt;The trading restrictions meant Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;couldn’t buy any shares of the main meme stocks&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;heavily limited&lt;/a&gt; the number of shares its users could buy in other companies — at one point, users could only buy shares of Express if they owned less than five already. For Koss, you were only allowed to buy a single share. The freeze attracted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of user lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;review bombs&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;attention from lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the other lawsuits and investigations haven’t ended up going anywhere, though, according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt; and Batista’s lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKkKMH"&gt;The arbitrator &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/21-01206.pdf"&gt;doesn’t give a rationale&lt;/a&gt; for Batista’s win. However, Batista’s lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.iorioaltamirano.com/blog/read-more-about-iorio-altamirano-llps-historic-arbitration-award-against-robinhood-for-january-2021-trading-restrictions/"&gt;wrote a post&lt;/a&gt; theorizing about why they were successful where others had failed: because the case focused on “Robinhood’s inadequate liquidity management practices and monitoring of its counterparty risk.” The post also says that they “attacked, head-on, the notion that Robinhood’s customer agreement gives it unfettered right to restrict trading for any reason, at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZ6dZL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other spurned traders may use this case as a template&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Enwu8U"&gt;To other traders, the case could represent blood in the water. While arbitration decisions don’t set legal precedent, meaning that another arbitrator could rule a different way in an almost identical case, Batista’s lawyer calls for other Robinhood customers to contact the firm. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s0z2vb/apparently_someone_successfully_sued_robinhood/"&gt;few threads&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/s0z8v3/a_27yearold_truck_driver_just_became_robinhoods/"&gt;stock-related subreddits&lt;/a&gt; have already pointed out the possibility that the case could be used as an example to try and get a payout from Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HmMF5"&gt;In addition to the $29,460.77 in damages Batista will receive, Robinhood will also be on the hook for a few more grand: the arbitrator ordered it to pay almost a year’s interest on the money. Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/21-01206.pdf"&gt;will also have to pay filing&lt;/a&gt; and some other fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8Q9oL"&gt;Robinhood, the parent company of the two entities named in the dispute, declined to provide an on-the-record response for this story. Those two entities are Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial. Both are members of FINRA, though the parent company is not — so the ruling applies to those two legal entities within Robinhood itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vwn3fS"&gt;While GameStop’s stock led to the trade restrictions, it’s not what Batista filed his complaint about. Batista &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; own GameStop shares at the time but had no plans of selling them, according to &lt;em&gt;MarketWatch&lt;/em&gt;. Some Redditors have urged him to put his winnings back into GameStop, but he instead plans on investing the money into his trucking business and using it to pay for childcare, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7n78q/robinhood-trader-wins-dollar30000-in-first-of-its-kind-payout-following-gamestop-mania"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wj8TOI"&gt;For Batista, it seems like a happy end to the saga — maybe his story will be adapted as part of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;bajillion movies, documentaries, and TV shows&lt;/a&gt; that are supposedly in the works about the GameStop / WallStreetBets bonanza.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Expanse season 6 makes me worry about the future of touchscreens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1ek5119IWooU2vgpfF0H4nfhu8=/9x0:2121x1408/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384249/the_expanse_season_6_epsiode_2_roci_crew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt; I hope the future can do better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SH0ZsY"&gt;As we hurtle towards &lt;em&gt;The Expanse’s&lt;/em&gt; sixth and final episode of its sixth and final season — airing this Friday, January 14th — I can’t stop thinking about one thing: how many of this season’s pivotal moments revolved around pressing the wrong button on a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGOoes"&gt;“If it comes across that the touchscreen is the hero of the show, then we will have truly failed,” says showrunner Naren Shankar, telling me he objects to my entire line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYWtYC"&gt;I wouldn’t say they failed! I enjoyed the whole season, even if it felt a little... &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22851119/the-expanse-season-6-final-amazon-x-ray"&gt;cramped&lt;/a&gt;. I’m excited for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22826567/the-expanse-telltale-series-announcement-in-development-camina-drummer"&gt;the game&lt;/a&gt;, too. But it’s been 15 years since Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o"&gt;introduced the first iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m kind of hoping touchscreens don’t &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trip us up in another 300 years or so. Sadly, like much of the excellent series, it’s all too plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWqKmK"&gt;I spoke to Shankar and authors / writers / showrunners Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham about those user interfaces last month. Also, I badgered them about whether and how &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; might return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LfZVF"&gt;But first, you probably want to know what the heck I’m talking about re: touchscreens. And that requires spoilers.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RczgY2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler warning: this story contains huge spoilers for The Expanse season 6, episodes 1-5. If you’re caught up, you’re good; I won’t mention episode 6 at all. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YCbJt2"&gt;1) Those buttons are right next to each other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OFbtTI"&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse &lt;/em&gt;season 5, Camina Drummer and her Belter crew are on the run, having defected from Marco Inaros and his Free Navy. He effectively forced them to join or die, but they decided not to become his guns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9EVCZ"&gt;They are tired. Frazzled. So fatigued that in the midst of a carefully planned ambush necessary to escape the Free Navy’s clutches, Michio stabs &lt;em&gt;the wrong touchscreen button. &lt;/em&gt;Not just any wrong button, either: instead of blowing the enemy to scrap, it sends out a signal that reveals their exact position. “What did you do?” Drummer screams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DdxKOgIJwXKSohp_I8WwWLedN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164113/wrong_button.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe don’t put buttons right next to each other when one of them will kill you? Then again, Belters jury-rig everything, so I suppose it’s not too surprising they carelessly bound this macro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nBH9FB"&gt;This single action sets up the entire chain of events for Drummer’s crew right through episode 5. Critically low on supplies (they had to blow up two salvageable ships to save themselves, using physical buttons, I might add) and after deciding they need to offload the mentally weary Michio after the touchscreen debacle, they find themselves making an uneasy alliance with another Belter captain. He leads them to exactly what Drummer needs to undermine Marco Inaros’ credibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVXfTK"&gt;I’m totally fine with this plot-wise, even though I am the kind of person who would never, ever trust myself to stab a touchscreen in a moving vehicle. (Volume dials, please!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4zYkFU"&gt;2) Touchscreen drone controls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htVO6UbNpaJQgSJ8YeJRC2K-DrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164337/expanse_touchscreen_drone_controls.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2FrMNj"&gt;We now know the mysterious new world Laconia, accessible from our solar system via the Ring Gate, is home to intelligent lifeforms with the power to repair things... and perhaps even people. By the beginning of episode 5, the “Dogs” appear to have helped precocious little girl Cara bring her brother back from the dead — one of the biggest revelations about what humanity might be capable of in &lt;em&gt;The Expanse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQRacV"&gt;What gave her the idea to drag her brother’s corpse into the wilderness? Way back in episode 2, she was flying a drone with touchscreen controls (already a bad idea if you ask me!), pushes the joystick the wrong direction without looking at the drone’s surroundings, and it hits a tree branch and crashes into the ground. But when she returns in episode 3, she finds the Dogs have fixed her drone (as well as an alien chick she’d befriended and accidentally killed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni0SA2"&gt;Come on, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;we already had self-flying drones&lt;/a&gt; that could have dodged that branch in 2019, much less 2350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EEGUd8"&gt;3) The dud torpedo&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kk3wLoRRmc9H4mpuPL9HQ7xL-B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164562/holden_wrist_touchscreen_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holden’s a pro with the wrist computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdk7bF"&gt;This one’s 100 percent intentional. At the end of episode 3, The Rocinante has miraculously slipped out of Marco Inaros’ clutches (thanks to a combination of superior firepower, piloting, and luck) and is ready to deliver a killing blow... but after they fire a nuclear torpedo, Holden swiftly and secretly disables the nuke part from his touchscreen wrist computer to avoid killing Naomi’s son. The torpedo doesn’t explode, temporarily convincing everyone that it was a dud — except both the ship’s computer and the eventually recovered torpedo keep a record of Holden’s authorization in their logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WWVf9"&gt;You can argue whether Holden made the right choice or not, and in general, I love how &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s interfaces automatically surface the controls their owners might use next, like quickly opening, locking, and unlocking doors aboard a ship. But once again, it’s a pivotal moment where pressing one button on a touchscreen instead of another has lasting repercussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="52Eksk"&gt;Bonus: Holden’s hammer&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNA3Kg-j3DXdHwB9Ko7hwzAyQaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166514/expanse_holden_hammer.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not sure if it’s technically a pry bar or a nail puller he’s holding, but either way it’s tiny and probably not the real reason the engine stops? Probably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BNYIjD"&gt;Twenty-five minutes into episode 1, shortly after Michio’s touchscreen button fail, Holden is standing on an asteroid that’s been outfitted with its own engine so the Free Navy can fire it at Earth. Suddenly, that engine starts to fire up... and with no time to react, Holden just smashes the damn thing with a pry bar till it stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="msSZOI"&gt;What The Expanse’s writers had to say&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V25ARW"&gt;So I asked the authors and showrunners: &lt;strong&gt;how, exactly, did user interfaces hurt you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZA9DWA"&gt;“I did almost 10 years of frontline tech support; user interfaces and I are going to die with our teeth in each other’s necks,” replies Daniel Abraham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWAdPf"&gt;“And I’m going to take issue with the question,” says Naren Shankar (as I’ve already mentioned). “Yes, all of them involve buttons,” he admits, “but the scene is about the emotional decision to push a button.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oqwwKB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10976337"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi3c83"&gt;“What we should have done was go back and have a bunch of those switches,” Abraham jokes. “The old toggle switches and everything,” agrees Ty Franck. “I wish we had a lot more of those buttons in the show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VCeXY"&gt;“But to be more serious for a second, all of those moments that you cite are quite emotionally motivated, extremely in two of the cases [...] That’s how they fly the ship. Sometimes they do some things by talking to it, that doesn’t mean it’s always a voice-to-text parser,” adds Shankar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjmk4M"&gt;“Except in the Solomon Epstein one we did, that was totally the fault of the voice parser,” says Franck, I think, though I’ve started to lose track as they’re talking over each other. He’s referencing how &lt;a href="https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Paradigm_Shift"&gt;season 2, episode 6&lt;/a&gt; flashes back to how an engineer accidentally invented long-range space travel and dies because he can’t turn the engine off; he disabled his crappy voice parser before launch, and the g-forces are too strong for him to reach the other controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOM88R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do touchscreens mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQIrHg"&gt;“It’s kind of the same question as ‘why do we use guns instead of laser blasters or something like that?’” says Abraham. “There’s kind of a technological endpoint you can reach where something works well, and then you kind of stick with it. We have cartridge guns in The Expanse because they work really well; they’re kind of the sharks of personal weaponry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xv1FbI"&gt;“What we’re positing here is that these touchscreens and these kinds of interfaces are robust and work well in these kinds of conditions, where jacking into your brain, maybe not so much? Speech, yelling commands to the ship is cool, but it’s kind of a shitty interface in practice,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84cofL"&gt;“Humans interact with the world with their fingertips. There’s millions of years of evolution behind that — our fingers are connected to our brains differently than any other part of us,” Franck chimes in. “When we want to accomplish a thing, our first instinct is to reach out and touch something and manipulate it with their fingers ... so when I see something where people are no longer using their hands to do work, it feels false to me, it’s ignoring the realities of what humans do as biological entities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="chSgu9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’ve reached for a Wikipedia level of plausibility”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwGaQs"&gt;All that said, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s authors and showrunners caution that they’re not trying to predict the future. “Science fiction is about the age in which it’s written.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve been trying to keep what we’ve done plausible, but I don’t know if we’re really aiming to say how a fusion drive will really work, how stealth technology will really work. I’ve always said we’ve reached for a Wikipedia level of plausibility,” says Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want the ‘TLDR’ on a site’s terms of service? There’s a bill for that</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Democrats’ 2019 Issues Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKFu4UYhkbliNfo_Tl9Vd74XZYM=/0x0:5200x3467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384007/1136463264.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MVElN"&gt;Democrats and Republicans are getting behind a new bill, introduced Thursday, that would force tech companies to simplify the language in their terms of service agreements, making it easier for consumers to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhRbZA"&gt;The Terms-of-service Labeling, Design and Readability Act – &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act.pdf"&gt;or TLDR for short&lt;/a&gt; – would require websites to provide a “summary statement” for users before they opt in to a terms of service agreement. The statement would summarize the legal jargon into something more easily understood by the average user, along with disclosing any recent data breaches (from the three years) and the types of sensitive data the site may collect. The summary &lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act_one-pager.pdf"&gt;would also explain&lt;/a&gt; “whether a consumer can delete their data, and if so, provide instructions on how.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ynKda"&gt;“For far too long, blanket terms of service agreements have forced consumers to either ‘agree’ to all of a company’s conditions or lose access to a website or app entirely,” Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA), one of the bill’s lead sponsors, said in a statement on Thursday. “No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ps8BqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgavg6"&gt;This bipartisan push for greater transparency into tech comes after Facebook faced months of criticism from lawmakers over how the company may harm users. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807909/frances-haugen-congress-testify-section-230-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified&lt;/a&gt; before Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, outlining a series of leaks she released after leaving the social media company. Lawmakers used these disclosures as a means of demanding more transparency from the embattled social media company and others, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747330/snap-tiktok-youtube-facebook-papers-blumenthal-coppa-kids-child-safety"&gt;like Snap, TikTok, and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNBIeA"&gt;It’s unclear if lawmakers have received any additional internal reports, like those concerned with mental health, from any large tech companies, as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0veuP"&gt;While the TLDR Act applies to most large websites and apps, like Facebook and Twitter, it exempts some small businesses. The Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general would be the main enforcers of the law, and they would be authorized to seek civil action against sites that break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m4za1"&gt;“Users should not have to comb through pages of legal jargon in a website’s terms of services to know how their data will be used,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA). “Requiring companies to provide an easy-to-understand summary of their terms should be mandatory and is long overdue.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The real beauty of Wordle is how its emoji results tell a story</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCYxMS"&gt;Did you struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today? I sure as hell did, racking up my second ever failure since I started playing the game at the beginning of the year. I was annoyed at myself more than the puzzle and eased that frustration by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1481580704441978887"&gt;sharing my results on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9k7lQ"&gt;As I did, I realized why the game’s auto-generated grids of emoji are so brilliant. It’s not just that they’re social (though that certainly helps), nor is it that they’re intriguing (there’s no link to the game and no explanation for the uninitiated as to what the emoji mean). No, it’s because each grid tells a story with wonderful concision. With just 30 squares and three colors, &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; emoji results convey narratives of luck, frustration, perseverance, and failure; each grid a miniature story, like a landscape painted in a matchbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmqWCb"&gt;Okay, okay, I get it — this sounds a little over the top! But take a look below at my failed result from today. You can see I get off to a good start, scoring two correct letters in the correct positions immediately. Then I try again, and, okay, I don’t get any more hits, but I’ve still got that solid foundation. Another try: nada. Two more: still nothing! Then the sixth and final guess, annnnd crash: I fail completely, those two unbroken lines of green emoji forming a comedic anticlimax, like a pair of skidmarks disappearing over the edge of a cliff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLf4DH"&gt;At least, that’s how I see it. In my head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jtsnqv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;had an absolute mare &lt;br&gt;Wordle 208 X/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;br&gt; ⬜⬜ ⬜&lt;/p&gt;— James Vincent (@jjvincent) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjvincent/status/1481580704441978887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgWhrk"&gt;To rationalize this a bit more, I think &lt;em&gt;Wordle’s&lt;/em&gt; emoji results work particularly well as story-telling devices for two reasons. The first is that they’re chronological. Like panels in a cartoon, you read the emoji as a narrative, each line — each guess — building on the one before. Unlike a video game high score or a finished crossword puzzle, these aren’t just trophies of skill but replays of the entire game. You know that if someone got all green on their second guess, then their win was more luck than skill. But if you see them battling through grey and yellow squares down to the sixth line, you know that win took &lt;em&gt;guts&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeYUvQ"&gt;The second reason is that each grid is something of a &lt;em&gt;roman à clef&lt;/em&gt;. By this, I mean that if you’ve played the game in question, you’ll recognize what letters the player got right and wrong, allowing you to flesh out the story in your head (and perhaps compare it to your own). That’s where the social element comes back again (as well as Wordle’s puzzle-a-day mechanic): it encourages you to play the game yourself and so better decipher your friends’ results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVOihM"&gt;The only downside of this system is that the results — like all emoji — are not particularly friendly to people using a screen reader. Instead of offering a visual snapshot, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annaecook/status/1478409873645731840"&gt;they become a robotic dirge&lt;/a&gt; of [Green square] [Three wide large square] [Yellow square] and so on, like a tar pit of emoji description. (The best way around this, I’ve learned only recently, is to take a screenshot of the results and then add a description to the alt text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLZeFi"&gt;Of course, the popularity of &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; is more or less guaranteed to flame out any day now. And when that happens, all those grids of emoji will return to their natural, mute state; no longer signifying stories of grit and triumph but becoming once more, just colored squares. It’s the only proper ending to viral fame: all those moments lost, like emoji in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
