    <title>Spelunky is coming to the Switch along with other great-looking indies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dAnM6_jrtWL8t7DFUgf8q1pNV9E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516875/50343276481_8cbf4a7507_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSvMCN"&gt;At its latest indie showcase, Nintendo revealed a handful of intriguing titles coming to the Switch in 2021. The biggest reveal is that &lt;em&gt;Among Us,&lt;/em&gt; one of 2020’s biggest games, isn’t just coming to the Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;but it’ll be available later today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rx4Rq"&gt;There were plenty of other cool announcements as well. One of the most notable reveals was that classic rouguelike series &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the Switch next year. That includes both the original &lt;em&gt;Spelunky&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;Spelunky 2&lt;/em&gt;, with local multiplayer for both (and online for the sequel) in summer 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5VCdz"&gt;Other reveals include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HGBLPO"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fisti-fluffs&lt;/em&gt;, a physics-based brawler about cats wreaking havoc in an empty house, will launch in early 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rK9l5H"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tunche&lt;/em&gt;, a hand-drawn action game about exploring a fantasy version of the Amazon rainforest, will be out in March 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HKa4H8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cyber-Shadow&lt;/em&gt;, a retro, pixel-art action game from Mechanical Head Studios (and published by &lt;em&gt;Shovel Knight&lt;/em&gt; studio Yacht Club Games), will launch on January 26th, 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gNTB0B"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Calico&lt;/em&gt;, another cat-themed game, this time about running an adorable cat cafe, will be available later today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="PyTBVv"&gt;

    <title>Among Us launches for the Nintendo Switch today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x4_XYawVzyLuRO3mT81m89untuc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516854/ss_eab32f16b59c005489c10f9063227ed7b54b31ec.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qxoMw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, Innersloth’s breakout hit of 2020, is coming to the Nintendo Switch today. The news was announced during a special indie game-focused Nintendo Direct. The game will feature crossplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xzsfn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is an online social deduction game, one in which players have to work together to complete tasks around the ship and figure out who the crew’s imposters are. Imposters, meanwhile, attempt to quietly kill as many other players as they can. Although the game first launched in 2018, it’s become a sensation, thanks to a newfound popularity on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452358/fall-guys-among-us-twitch-facebook-gaming"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, played by streamers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523878/aoc-twitch-stream-among-us-pokimane"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has become so popular, in fact, that Innersloth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;canceled the game’s sequel&lt;/a&gt; to focus on improving the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw4by3"&gt;The game picked up the award for best multiplayer title of the year during this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168243/among-us-innersloth-new-map-airship-early-2021"&gt;Game Awards&lt;/a&gt;. A new airship map is expected next year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA Play won’t come to Xbox Game Pass for PC until 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNo788jRd4zAGdlsbzgCnMluiz0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516669/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EOh1g2"&gt;PC gamers subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC or the pricier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier will need to wait just a little while longer until they have access to EA Play on Windows machines. Today, Microsoft announced that EA Play would arrive on PC as part of Xbox Game Pass sometime in 2021. Originally, the partnership was supposed to &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;go into effect today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpXa0q"&gt;“We established this partnership with Electronic Arts because they are as passionate as we are about helping people and communities discover great games, and we knew we could provide a great experience for members by working together. In order to deliver on that, we need more time to provide the Xbox Game Pass experience,” reads &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/15/update-on-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-2021/"&gt;a Microsoft blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhGcrZ"&gt;EA Play is an online video game subscription service that provides access to a library of first-party EA games — including &lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Sims 4 — &lt;/em&gt;plus 10-hour trials for new releases like &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;/em&gt;. EA Play was previously known as EA Access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368737/ea-access-origin-subscription-rebrand-exclusives-price-drop"&gt;before the company rebranded in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcjL9h"&gt;EA Play is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;already part of Xbox Game Pass for consoles as of November&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Xbox One owners plus those who’ve been able to get their hands on an Xbox Series X / S console to download and play games from EA Play on Xbox hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet adds live captions on the web for French, German, Portuguese and Spanish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksQ7UT1EQC3LJGUx3Ghl2fKFCHQ=/0x171:1024x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516592/Google_Meet.max_2800x2800.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cBnkZL"&gt;Google Meet is adding live captions on the web in four languages to make meetings more inclusive, the &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/12/additional-language-support-for-live-captions.html"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Live captions in Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese will be available across all versions of Meet starting today. Meet rolled out real-time captions in English last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WJhYP"&gt;“We know from our work with teachers and parents over the years how essential caption tools can be for students with learning disabilities, as well as English-language learners in both K-12 and higher education,” Google Workspace project manager Philip Nelson wrote in a blog post announcing the update. “By expanding live captions to more languages, we can help more students feel empowered to participate, and help more teachers share a space that is both accessible and inclusive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZZ1A3"&gt;Google has continued to add updates to Meet as the platform has seen booming growth during the coronavirus pandemic, such as providing attendance reports with viewership data for live streamed events and allowing users to “raise” their hands in larger meetings. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;earlier announced&lt;/a&gt; it was extending unlimited Meet calls in its free version through March 31st for Gmail accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNNkji"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21531711/google-alphabet-ad-revenue-youtube-waymo-cloud-search"&gt;Google said in October&lt;/a&gt; that Meet had 235 million daily meetings and more than 7.5 billion daily video calls in the third quarter of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad’s new leather MacBook Pro sleeves are luxurious but pricey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B23XwTLixrhWFayQZQMAtkaQSDg=/114x0:1926x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516593/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khMIkp"&gt;Accessory company Nomad is expanding its case lineup once again with its first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Flaptop-sleeve-horween-leather-rustic-brown-macbookpro-16-inch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2F22176171%2Fnomad-new-leather-macbook-pro-sleeves-luxury-expensive-price-release-date-hands-on#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro sleeves&lt;/a&gt;, available today. The cases might be the nicest that Nomad has made so far, but with a starting price of $229.95 (for the 13-inch model) and $249.95 (for 16-inch MacBook Pros), they’re also the most expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8gWsh"&gt;The MacBook Pro cases are made out of the same brown Horween leather that Nomad uses for most of its products. But instead of the plastic shell the company uses on its iPhone cases (which I’m less of a fan of), the new cases are just solid expanses of leather on the outside, backed by EVA foam to keep your computer safe, with a final layer of microfiber cloth for the interior. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pCv-YUSEApsGPFEllca5PMHQq3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171815/_DSC7173.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C charging cutout on the side of the Nomad MacBook Sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj282O"&gt;I’ve been able to use one of the cases for the past few days, and I’ve been pretty impressed by the quality. The leather looks and feels great, and Nomad has been pretty thoughtful about some of the details, like the hidden magnetic snaps that keep the case shut or the small cutout on the side that allows for accessing the USB-C ports for charging or docking your laptop while it’s still in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EtRlf"&gt;Sliding a MacBook in or out of the case is easy, and the case itself feels solid enough, although there are likely more durable options, if protection is the number one priority — especially given the cost. Additionally, as an owner of a MacBook Pro with just two USB-C ports, I did have to think about which direction I was placing my laptop inside the case to line up the ports with the charging cutout. And while that cutout is useful, I did have some concerns that it would provide a good avenue for dust or debris to make its way inside the case over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWVl91"&gt;Given the current state of the world, I haven’t been able to extensively test how the leather holds up in the stress of a daily commute, but the company does promise that the exterior should develop a nice patina over time, similar to its other cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgfHcI"&gt;The leather laptop cases are designed specifically to fit Apple’s 13-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros (from the 2016-era design), although you’ll likely be able to fit other similarly sized laptops, too. Just be aware that it might be a bit tighter or looser than you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KlSBF"&gt;The cases are available now on Nomad’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will soon be able to add a 3D effect to 2D photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Blxfa-J7pTGf92NpYiKwv5lFVoo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516599/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hwFDQ"&gt;Google Photos will soon be able to take your 2D images and make them appear as if they’re 3D, the company announced in a blog post on Tuesday. Google is calling these types of images “Cinematic photos,” and they’re a new type of image the app can show as part of its Memories feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpYDO0"&gt;Here’s a GIF from Google comparing a 2D image to a Cinematic photo. I think the feature looks pretty impressive:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UqlpIT2NQMLsH7n-Z-9iyZTrYas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171944/ezgif_2_b86c3878385a.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WIOWAI"&gt;To make Cinematic photos, “we use machine learning to predict an image’s depth and produce a 3D representation of the scene—even if the original image doesn’t include depth information from the camera,” Jamie Aspinall, a Google Photos product manager, writes in Tuesday’s blog. “Then we animate a virtual camera for a smooth panning effect—just like out of the movies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGf0qt"&gt;Google says Google Photos will automatically make Cinematic photos, and they’ll appear in the recent highlights section above your photo grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUNcNm"&gt;The company is also adding new themes for Memories. Now, you’ll be able to see Memories about important people in your life, and soon, Google Photos will show you Memories about your favorite things (Google gave the example of sunsets) and activities (such as baking or hiking). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCmtUO"&gt;These new features in Memories will be rolling out to users over the next month, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s not as easy to get a Cyberpunk 2077 refund as CD Projekt Red suggested</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3oLDizJXjp-I8vE0mQOBKYSDlNc=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516541/cyberpunk_2077_800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h21efq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red has confirmed it has no special refund agreement with Microsoft or Sony, despite saying dissatisfied players should return their copies of the game in a statement. It means players are covered by both platforms’ standard refund policies, which, in the case of Sony, explicitly prohibits refunds if you’ve already started playing a game “unless the content is faulty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8SpLo"&gt;The confirmation came from the company’s senior vice president of business development, Michał Nowakowski, on an &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/call-transcript_en.pdf"&gt;investor call&lt;/a&gt; held on Monday evening. “Microsoft and Sony have refund policies for every product that is released digitally on their storefronts,” Nowakowski said. “Despite several articles I’ve seen that things are being set up just for us, it’s actually not true — these policies are in place and have always been in place; they’re not offered specifically for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bFk0iu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re not offered specifically for us.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q20ogQ"&gt;“Anyone who has purchased any title on the PlayStation network or the Microsoft storefront can ask for a refund, and if it’s made within certain boundaries, usually related to time, usage and so on, can ask for that refund,” he continued. “Our procedure here with Microsoft and Sony is not different than with any other title released on any of those storefronts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3jIT4"&gt;The investor call followed widespread reports that the game has serious performance problems on older consoles. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22166912/cyberpunk-2077-base-ps4-xbox-one-bugs-issues-glitches-performance-trees-bushes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that players have been experiencing “glitches, frame rate issues, major pop-in and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJ1vjh"&gt;Confusion about refunds arose after reports circulated that players were successfully claiming them for the game, despite already having downloaded and played it. One &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kb92ne/psa_sony_is_issuing_refunds_even_past_the_2_hour/"&gt;poster on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; reported they received a refund from Sony despite having played “well over 10 hours” of the game, and other commenters said they’d had similar success. The reports were notable since Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/ps-store-refund-request/"&gt;official rules about refunds&lt;/a&gt; state, “If you have started to download or stream the purchased content you will not be eligible for a refund unless the content is faulty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fzcjjc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders"&gt;Microsoft’s rules&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, don’t specifically mention not being able to refund a game after you’ve started playing it. Instead, they outline a 14-day window after purchase in which a customer may be eligible for a refund. We have contacted both Microsoft and Sony to get clarification on their refund policies. Policies around refunds for boxed copies are governed by the individual store where a copy was purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyOQJz"&gt;Then, on Monday morning, CD Projekt Red issued a statement suggesting anyone who’d bought the game for PS4 or Xbox One could return their copy if they’re not pleased with the game. “If you are not pleased with the game on your console and don’t want to wait for updates, you can opt to refund your copy,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472/photo/1"&gt;the statement read&lt;/a&gt;. It gave an email address for players to contact if they had any problems. It prompted speculation that CD Projekt Red had made a special agreement to allow players to return the game despite the usual rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PDYGkV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/jtF5WKCiro"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EDfSZE"&gt;We now know this is not the case, and it seems many players found that out when they’ve tried to request refunds. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-15-the-cyberpunk-2077-refund-situation-is-a-mess-of-mixed-messages"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that players have had mixed results from trying to request refunds from Microsoft and Sony. One &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mgs2master2/status/1338533404615135235"&gt;user on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; posted screenshots of a conversation with Sony customer support in which they were refused a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnM2JY"&gt;On the same investor call, Nowakowski offered some explanation for how the game managed to release with as many problems as it has on older consoles. The executive suggested the team had been too preoccupied with optimizing the game for “PC and next-gen performance rather than current-gen,” and added, “We definitely did not spend enough time looking at that.” However, he denied there being any undue pressure to release the game when they did.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will use fully driverless trucks to make deliveries in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uJqG9X3Xj9c5gBwSUp2NsFTU0NY=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516473/gatik_self_driving_vehicle_use_for_lead_image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eR8xcg"&gt;Walmart will use fully autonomous box trucks to make deliveries in Arkansas starting in 2021. The big-box retailer has been working with a startup called Gatik on a delivery pilot for 18 months. Next year, the two companies plan on taking their partnership to the next level by removing the safety driver from their autonomous box trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYnR4c"&gt;Gatik, which is based in Palo Alto and Toronto, outfitted several multitemperature box trucks with sensors and software to enable autonomous driving. Since last year, those trucks have been operating on a two-mile route between a “dark store” (a store that stocks items for fulfillment but isn’t open to the public) and a nearby Neighborhood Market in Bentonville, Arkansas. Since then, the vehicles have racked up 70,000 miles in autonomous mode with a safety driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HuLGIB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gatik describes its approach to self-driving hardware and software as “radically divergent”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CsbQF5"&gt;Next year, the companies intend to start incorporating fully autonomous trucks into those deliveries. And they plan on expanding to a second location in Louisiana, where trucks with safety drivers will begin delivering items from a “live” Walmart Supercenter to a designated pickup location where customers can retrieve their orders. Those routes, which will begin next year, will be longer than the Arkansas operation — 20-miles between New Orleans and Metairie, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7mIG2"&gt;“Our trials with Gatik are just two of many use cases we’re testing with autonomous vehicles, and we’re excited to continue learning how we might incorporate them in a delivery ecosystem,” said Tom Ward, Walmart’s senior VP of customer product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9OXyU"&gt;Gatik describes its approach to self-driving hardware and software as “radically divergent.” In a Medium post, Gatik CEO and co-founder Gautam Narang described the process that gives the company the confidence to pull safety drivers out of its vehicles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cuKz1I"&gt;We decompose the massive monolithic DNNs into micro-models whose intended functionality is restricted to a very specific explainable task, and build rule-based fallback &amp;amp; validation systems around them. Given extensive knowledge of Gatik’s well-defined ODDs and hybrid architecture, we are able to hyper-optimize our models with exponentially less data, establish gate-keeping mechanisms to maintain explainability, and ensure continued safety of the system for unmanned operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KWwnJ8"&gt;Walmart is working with a variety of self-driving companies in its search for the best fit for the company’s massive retail and delivery operations. In addition to Gatik, the big-box company is working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611760/waymo-walmart-self-driving-vehicles-groceries-discounts"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004678/nuros-driverless-delivery-robots-walmart-houston"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;Udelv, Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18087898/ford-walmart-postmates-self-driving-grocery-delivery-miami"&gt;Ford, and Postmates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Months later, the great Twitter hack still boggles my mind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZ0hzmegFR0txJnol34qnenW5D0=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516442/VRG_ILLO_1777_twitter_bitcoin_verified.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ceT25e"&gt;One of the wildest stories of the year was the day some of the most-followed Twitter accounts on the planet posted cryptocurrency scams because of a massive unprecedented hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibDhao"&gt;Elon Musk was the first hacked account most people noticed. “I’m feeling generous because of COVID-19,” a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;now-deleted 4:17PM ET tweet said&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ll double any BTC payment sent to my BTC address for the next hour. Good luck, and stay safe out there!” The tweet also included an address where people could send bitcoin. But because Twitter scammers regularly use Musk’s name and image to post cryptocurrency scams, it was hard to tell if the tweet was just Musk mocking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dN1wqG"&gt;It quickly became clear that, yes, Musk was hacked, and it wasn’t just him. The company accounts of Coinbase, Gemini, and Binance had posted suspicious tweets shortly before Musk did. Then a deluge of tweets appeared: Apple, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Floyd Mayweather, Jeff Bezos, Joe Biden, Kanye West, Michael Bloomberg, Uber, Warren Buffett, Wiz Khalifa, and others all posted tweets like Musk’s in short order. Some accounts posted multiple tweets while under the hackers’ control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xlfXWn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9315987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5V11rG"&gt;Presumably, many of these accounts are protected by things like two-factor authentication and strong passwords that would make them very hard to break into. The fact that they were all posting the scam suggested that the attackers had access to some kind of internal Twitter tool to bypass that security — and Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/3/16603620/rogue-twitter-employees-trump-account-deletion"&gt;confirmed that was the case&lt;/a&gt; later that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAMqFd"&gt;Notably, President Donald Trump’s account wasn’t co-opted to post the scheme. Since we live in a world where Trump can move markets and make international headlines with one 280-character missive on Twitter, it’s likely a good thing that his account wasn’t taken over. While we don’t know if the hackers even attempted to tweet as Trump, his account reportedly has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327782/trump-twitter-hacked-massive-attack-bitcoin-scam"&gt;extra protections&lt;/a&gt; that may have prevented an intrusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iwzKE"&gt;The chaos was funny, in its way. For a little while, it appeared that Twitter had stopped verified accounts from posting new tweets. That meant &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and the majority of our staff weren’t able to tweet, so we briefly relied on former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer Casey Newton’s unverified wrestling-focused Twitter account (which currently has 207 followers) to share &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuplexCasey/status/1283529700615221248"&gt;updates about the attack&lt;/a&gt;. Other unverified accounts &lt;a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/07/twitter-hack-bitcoin-verified-blue-checks-accounts-locked-joke-tweets"&gt;filled our timelines with jokes&lt;/a&gt; about a world free of blue checkmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OZjy7r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;society if we didn’t unfreeze verified accounts &lt;a href="https://t.co/3P9D9kzb7u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3P9D9kzb7u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— vampire workday (@imbobswaget) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imbobswaget/status/1283531817077952519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="SF9wT3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the blue checks can't post, it's time for the proletariat revolution on twitter dot com&lt;/p&gt;— zoë o   (@zoenone0none) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zoenone0none/status/1283528258730983426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KuwQel"&gt;About two weeks after the hack, it became clear that this was the work of a teenager. Three people were charged for the attack &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349920/twitter-hack-arrest-florida-teen-fbi-irs-secret-service"&gt;on July 31st&lt;/a&gt;, including a 17-year-old from Florida who authorities claimed was the “mastermind” of the operation. A 16-year-old from Massachusetts was served a search warrant by federal agents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418437/twitter-hack-16-year-old-massachusetts-investigation-findings"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; to investigate their potential involvement; this person “appears to have played an equal, if not more significant, role” than the 17-year-old, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/technology/twitter-hack.html#click=https://t.co/Lovgzaol8X"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imJ2HR"&gt;Those involved were able to steal over $118,000 worth of bitcoin by duping people into sending the cryptocurrency to the addresses included in the scam tweets, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/Twitter_Report"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; by New York’s Department of Financial Services. Because of the way bitcoin is designed, the transactions aren’t reversible, so there’s no way to return that money to the people it was stolen from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4p3xjC"&gt;Their attack didn’t use “any of the high-tech or sophisticated techniques often used in cyberattacks–no malware, no exploits, and no backdoors,” the report said. Instead, the hackers accessed internal Twitter tools by tricking Twitter employees into giving them login credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNjs83"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-continued-work-to-keep-twitter-secure.html"&gt;Twitter says&lt;/a&gt; it has strengthened its internal security and invested in new tools and training for employees and contractors. But months later, it’s still hard to fathom how a group of motivated hackers brought one of the most influential social networks on the planet to its knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlaRLg"&gt;Thank goodness it was apparently just a bunch of bitcoin-obsessed hackers behind the attack and that they didn’t use their unprecedented access to, say, start a war. In some ways, given Musk’s Twitter run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission and an unsuccessful defamation suit, it’s fitting that they chose his account to tell us what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Unzsa"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbuflo"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynCpME"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdhBns"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The year in scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JbNqaeAEKHwjNrcFuq59Mmzou6A=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68516351/VRG_ILLO_4330_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8iHSq"&gt;In February, a cab driver in Northern California was transporting a 92-year-old woman to the bank when &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-16/cab-driver-woman-25000-scam"&gt;she told him she was taking out $25,000 to send to the IRS&lt;/a&gt;. The driver, Raj Singh, thought this sounded suspicious. Perhaps it was an IRS scam? The woman didn’t believe him, but she agreed to stop by the police station just in case. There, a law enforcement officer convinced her Singh was right — scammers were trying to steal her money. The woman went home, Singh got a $50 gift card for his troubles, and that was the last time anything good happened in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNOTqh"&gt;In the ensuing months, we’ve been through a pandemic, an economic crisis, senseless police shootings, nationwide protests, a tsunami of misinformation, and an extremely fraught election. Scammers haven’t slept on the opportunities. Moments of crisis are ripe for exploitation, and con artists have been capitalizing on the widespread confusion to present concrete solutions to our troubles. (Hint: the solutions typically involve sending the scammers lots of cash.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GysXD8"&gt;In the background, the government has been running a grift of its own. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ruths-chris-got-an-extra-helping-of-small-business-aid-money-11587312001"&gt;Money for small businesses went to large corporations&lt;/a&gt;. The second stimulus check was promised and never delivered. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;got a hold of Donald Trump’s tax returns&lt;/a&gt;, revealing he paid $750 his first year in the White House, far less than my last medical bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFqXOA"&gt;The system is rigged to benefit the top 1 percent, which makes low-level scammers more relatable. When the odds are stacked against you, it can be tempting to cut corners, legally speaking. If 2020 taught us anything, it’s that the system is the real scam. Con artists are merely society’s id, acting out our worst instincts to get ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7tt0y"&gt;Which brings us to March. The pandemic was not yet a pandemic, but things were starting to get weird. At the start of the month, I met up with José Castañeda, a Google spokesperson, for coffee and instinctively tried to shake his hand, which traumatized both of us because we didn’t have hand sanitizer. Neither here nor there, but that was also the last time I had human contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3idXz"&gt;Out in Tennessee, two brothers were not so ill-prepared. On March 1st, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-purell-wipes-amazon-sellers.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article"&gt;Matt and Noah Colvin began driving around Chattanooga&lt;/a&gt; clearing out the hand sanitizer supply from every department store in the area, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/technology/coronavirus-purell-wipes-amazon-sellers.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Then they went to Kentucky and did the same thing. All told, they ended up with 17,700 bottles of sterilizing goodness, which they listed on Amazon for $8 to $70 each. Amazon took down the items and started suspending sellers for price gouging. The brothers were either entrepreneurs or pandemic profiteers, depending on how you interpret the American Dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KR2rzJ"&gt;By April, economic prospects were even worse, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/economy/april-jobs-report-2020-coronavirus/index.html"&gt;20.5 million Americans lost their jobs&lt;/a&gt;. The government decided to send $1,200 checks to people who made less than $99,000 (&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/coronavirus-stimulus-check-questions-answers-2020-4#will-i-get-a-stimulus-check?"&gt;or less than $136,500 as a household&lt;/a&gt;), but then the checks were delayed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/coming-to-your-1200-relief-check-donald-j-trumps-name/2020/04/14/071016c2-7e82-11ea-8013-1b6da0e4a2b7_story.html"&gt;because Trump needed to have his name printed on every single one&lt;/a&gt;. Genius PR stunt, but dick move. There was supposed to be a second stimulus check, but that hasn’t happened because politicians are constitutionally incapable of doing anything useful after the Thanksgiving holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMWmED"&gt;In the meantime, the government announced it was handing out $670 billion in forgivable loans for small businesses, as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/13/21320179/ppp-loans-sba-paycheck-protection-program-polling-kanye-west"&gt;Paycheck Protection Program, meant to keep workers on payroll&lt;/a&gt;. The money ran out quickly and many small businesses were left to die, partly because massive restaurant chains like Ruth’s Chris Steak House and Shake Shack somehow qualified for $20 million and $10 million, respectively. (Both companies were eventually shamed into returning the money.) Other recipients included private equity firms and companies with close ties to President Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/21320361/small-business-closing-covid-coronavirus-ppp-entrepreneur-economy-stimulus-loans"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just a coincidence, I am sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YWyQr"&gt;As businesses stayed shuttered and life moved permanently online, grifters hawked fake COVID-19 cures on all the big tech platforms. There were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285364/amazon-marketplace-mask-price-gouging-n95-3m-ppe"&gt;faux N95 masks on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/instagram-muscleman-arrested-for-allegedly-peddling-fak-1842507108"&gt;fake COVID-19 pills on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-06-17/worst-covid-19-coronavirus-crowdfunding-projects"&gt;dubious nose-only masks on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;, and dangerous &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/qanon-conspiracy-theorists-coronavirus-mms-bleach-youtube-twitter-944878/"&gt;bleach-drinking videos on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Tech companies banned health misinformation but had varying degrees of success in actually keeping it off the platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MU1t4"&gt;The one bright spot in recent weeks has been that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html?name=styln-coronavirus-vaccines&amp;amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;impression_id=495c1b20-34da-11eb-9e0f-55046f1deaea&amp;amp;variant=1_Show"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726554/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-pfizer-biontech"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; applied for emergency Food and Drug Administration authorizations for their COVID-19 vaccines. This could stop scammers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186098/phone-scam-cdc-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-reservation-police"&gt;who were calling people to try to get them to reserve a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; over the phone. But then again, probably not. Before the announcements, scammers were claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, they can say they’re with the drug companies. It’s 2020, after all, and people are nothing if not adaptable. &lt;/p&gt;
