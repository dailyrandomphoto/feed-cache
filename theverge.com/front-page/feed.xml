    <title>Asus ZenBook 13 OLED review: dazzling, to a point</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;AMD helps bring OLED to the mainstream&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YxIQ6X"&gt;Seeing a laptop with an OLED screen at a sub-$1,000 price point is wild. Not too long ago, finding that display technology under $2,000 would’ve been unthinkable. But if there’s anyone I’d trust to make sub-$1,000 OLED happen, it’s Asus, one of the masters of affordable, portable laptops. And if there’s any combination of companies I’d trust to make sub-$1,000 OLED happen without a battery life disaster, it’s Asus and AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6aqMx"&gt;That’s about what we got from the Asus ZenBook 13 OLED. Asus hasn’t finalized pricing on all units yet, but it gave me a range of $750 to $1,000. The unit I have — which includes AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800U, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to the 13.3-inch OLED FHD display — will presumably be at the top of that range. The base model, which would be $750, comes with a Ryzen 5 5600U, 8GBG of RAM, and 512GB of storage, which are also good specs for that price. There’s currently a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM260000011/laptops-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-7-5700U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS71"&gt;Ryzen 7 5700U model&lt;/a&gt; up for sale for $899.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED keyboard seen from above. The screen displays an LED numpad. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1dxILnkKa35DIClFdCx9TQJ-JM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424430/mchin_20190626_4502_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest collaboration between Asus and AMD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHNT2o"&gt;My test system performs well, and the OLED screen is vivid and bright. You shouldn’t expect too much more than that, and there are a few significant drawbacks. But it’s an impressive showcase for AMD’s excellent processor and a decent buy for anyone who’s limited to this price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z4iO16"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Contenders from the Ryzen 5000 mobile series that we’ve seen so far have been great performers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ObOHW1"&gt;Contenders from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 mobile series&lt;/a&gt; that we’ve seen so far have been great performers with excellent battery life to boot. So I was interested to see how this system would perform against competing laptops with Intel’s quad-core Core i7-1165G7. That chip can be found in a number of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; out there, including Asus’ own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt; and Dell’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QtLyKG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10611856"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juqm2f"&gt;Most unsurprisingly, the ZenBook 13 OLED dominated both of those laptops on battery life. I ran the system through my daily workload (using around a dozen Chrome tabs with some Zoom calls, Slacking, Google Docs work, and streaming from Spotify and YouTube), and averaged 11 hours and seven minutes of continuous use. That’s multiple hours more than the results I saw from running the XPS 13 and the ZenBook 14 through the same workload, both of which have typically more power-efficient LCD panels instead of OLED. The device took 56 minutes to juice up to 60 percent during light use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmM92h"&gt;Not only is that an impressively long lifespan as laptops go in general, but it’s certainly the longest result I’ve ever seen from an OLED screen. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, which I tested out last week, lasted for less than half of that time. Part of the reason is no doubt that the ZenBook’s screen is only FHD (1920 x 1080) resolution, while most other OLED panels are 4K or close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8KuC3"&gt;That resolution difference may be a dealbreaker to those with particularly discerning eyesight or to folks hoping to do color work, but this screen still looks quite good. You’ll notice the difference between an OLED and an LCD panel most if you’re viewing an image or watching a video: The per-pixel lighting produces brighter whites and darker blacks (since the pixels behind a black area just turn off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED half open, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wHiRXPEdgq3Jbu9iaRnSJ9DaV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424432/mchin_20190626_4502_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid is lustrous — the rest of the chassis is less so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AOFqut"&gt;The ZenBook 13 delivers vibrant colors and crisp details. It covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut and reached 368 nits in our testing. I did see some glare while I was working at lower brightness settings, but not enough to interfere with my work indoors. There’s no touchscreen option, which is a bit disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QygPZi"&gt;The eight-core 5800U worked just fine as my daily driver. It tore through dozens of Chrome tabs and apps with little to no heat anywhere in the chassis. I did get the sense that it was sweating a &lt;em&gt;bit.&lt;/em&gt; I could often hear the fans, even when I wasn’t pushing the ZenBook hard. I occasionally saw the CPU jump as high as the low 90s (Celsius) during gaming, but it stayed at acceptable temperatures otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OELD seen from above. The screen displays Zenbook and OLED logos on a multicolor background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hqbGmkSSCdjKVqfgABN4A9CkQ7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424433/mchin_20190626_4502_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a “Whisper” fan profile if the noise is a bother.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHE3wi"&gt;AMD’s recent integrated graphics have been fairly comparable to Intel’s Iris Xe graphics in the past, and while performance will always vary by title, that’s about what panned out here. The ZenBook 13 was most dominant on &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, where it averaged 235fps. The Intel ZenBook averaged 200fps on that title, while the XPS 13 averaged 205fps. It also won on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, averaging 30fps on the game’s lowest settings. That beats the XPS (which averaged 22fps), and just barely beats the ZenBook (which averaged 29fps). It still loses out to the M1 integrated graphics in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, though, and barely hits a level of playability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5ldyF"&gt;Results were more mixed on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, where the ZenBook 13 averaged 54fps on Ultra settings and 37fps on Epic settings. That beats the XPS once again but loses to the Intel ZenBook on both counts. Different strokes for different folks. Finally, the ZenBook 13 was drubbed on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s maximum settings, averaging 60fps where the XPS and the Intel ZenBook averaged 111fps and 92fps, respectively. &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; has seen a number of updates recently, so that could explain the performance delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED seen from the front, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wds61GZBq_t7rC6so2S1U-2OtzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424429/mchin_20190626_4502_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ErgoLift hinge tilts the deck up at a slight angle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED seen from the front. The screen displays Zenbook and OLED logos on a multicolor background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_8XEb92S0tq4yWV54h9MtfRSLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424434/mchin_20190626_4502_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s supposed to increase cooling capacity, and it also conveniently hides some of the bottom bezel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="NivJKC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10611867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I1jdkG"&gt;The ZenBook 13 OLED was also middle of the pack when it came to video workloads. The device completed an export of a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in 14 minutes and 14 seconds, which is a few minutes slower than both the ZenBook 14 (11 minutes and 28 seconds) and the XPS 13 (10 minutes and 43 seconds), and also slower than the M1 MacBook Air (eight minutes and 15 seconds). It’s not a surprise that the 5800U was weak on this test, as it lacks Intel’s Quick Sync feature. It was an improvement over the 15-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt;, which has a last-generation AMD Ryzen 7 4980U and took over 16 and a half minutes to complete the same task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbIETk"&gt;This ZenBook also scored a 201 on the PugetBench for Premiere Pro benchmark, which measures performance on real-world Premiere Pro tasks. That also beats scores we saw from last-generation Ryzen systems, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=22208"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt; with a Ryzen 7 4700U. It loses once again, though, to the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38019"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Asus Zenbook 13 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h02IsgNQEEHc58qBCFdLOnTaMT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424438/mchin_20190626_4502_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A and microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Zenbook 13 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CRts8OlLnmfv8nN3JF7OcEPJM1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424437/mchin_20190626_4502_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One HDMI, two USB-C on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94CcuG"&gt;So that’s where we are on the processor. It’s a powerful eight-core chip that delivers outstanding battery life, with integrated graphics that aren’t quite Apple M1 level but are on par with Intel’s best. If you’re familiar with previous ZenBook 13 models, you can now skip to the end because everything else about this laptop is very standard ZenBook fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfprb3"&gt;My biggest hangup on ZenBooks is always that they feel a bit cheap. There’s a fair amount of flex in the lid and keyboard and a bit of a plasticky texture throughout. (The bezels around the screen are also plastic, despite not being a terrible size.) The hinge isn’t the sturdiest, and the display flops around fairly easily if I pick the laptop up while it’s open. And the lid is a massive fingerprint magnet, which dampens an otherwise nice concentric swirl design. None of this is unexpected at this price point, and the ZenBook 13 is certainly nicer-looking than many devices you can get for under $1,000 — but it’s not comparable in build quality to an XPS or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam on the Asus Zenbook 13 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nt_zk1vqBBa2h3pOl11bRkg_AcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22424439/mchin_20190626_4502_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5PjPdb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10611877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1FR8U0"&gt;Another potential issue is the port selection. You get two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, one HDMI 2.1, and one microSD card reader. That’s fairly generous, except that there’s no audio jack. This isn’t as big of a problem now as it would’ve been a few years ago, but it could certainly be a dealbreaker for anyone who uses wired gear. (The device does ship with a dongle, but that still means your headphones or microphone will take up a USB-C port.) There’s also no Thunderbolt support since this is an AMD system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UU6HE"&gt;Finally, the webcam is grainy and not great, even in decent light. It does support Windows Hello. (That’s the only biometric authentication; there’s no fingerprint reader.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQTWPd"&gt;But the calling card of the ZenBook line isn’t build or ports; it’s portability. This ZenBook is actually a tad thicker and heavier than the Intel-based ZenBook 14, but it’s still thinner and lighter than the XPS at 2.5 pounds and dimensions of 11.97 x 7.99 x 0.55 inches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLGetT"&gt;Another fun feature modern ZenBooks have is NumberPad 2.0. If you tap a small icon in the top-right corner of the ZenBook 13 OLED’s touchpad, an LED numpad appears. I did accidentally whack this a couple of times while I was navigating but got better at avoiding it with practice. To Asus’ credit, you can still use the touchpad to navigate and click on things while the numpad is up without it thinking that you’re tapping numbers. Elsewhere, the touchpad is smooth and accurate, though the click sometimes came with a bit of rattle, and I occasionally saw some palm-rejection issues. The keyboard is more mushy than it is clicky, but it became fairly comfortable after I got used to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="inMY7C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard is more mushy than it is clicky&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmlgDn"&gt;For $1,000, the ZenBook 13 OLED is an impressive package. You get an efficient eight-core processor paired with an OLED display, in a thin and light chassis. There are some nice extra benefits (the LED numpad, the HDMI) and some drawbacks (the plastic look, the lack of headphone jack, the terrible webcam), but the screen and the processor are the stars of the show and the main considerations. While some of the drawbacks may be dealbreakers for some shoppers (they would be for me), many may see them as reasonable sacrifices in order to get this performance at this price point. If the latter is what you’re looking for, the ZenBook 13 OLED is one to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie is actually releasing a Destiny-themed toaster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDVJ7_pbS8fPsE5RPpZH5JP2DYI=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471282/Toaster_Still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Destiny Toaster in all its glory. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6pNyT"&gt;A year after Bungie said it would explore making an official Destiny Toaster during a charity livestream, our bread-based dreams are finally becoming a reality. The &lt;a href="https://bungiestore.com/products/coming-soon-destiny-toaster?_pos=1&amp;amp;_sid=6b126fab5&amp;amp;_ss=r&amp;amp;_ga=2.131536586.47542635.1624010540-1893777479.1624010540"&gt;Destiny Toaster&lt;/a&gt; is now available to preorder from Bungie’s online store for $84.99. It’s not due to ship until at least December, but Bungie says that once it does it’ll toast the game’s Tricorn logo into every slice of bread it touches. Does it also make normal toast? We have no clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAg2LO"&gt;If you’re a little lost as to why the developer of &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; would go to the effort of making a toaster (because lord knows I was), &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-official-destiny-toaster-is-real-and-you-can-order-one-now/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCGamer &lt;/em&gt;has you covered&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently “getting that bread” is in-game slang for getting a good loot drop, and there’s also a &lt;a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/J%C3%B6tunn"&gt;gun in the game&lt;/a&gt; that’s the spitting image of a toaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DjL4RB0j4OG5O-k8bcdPeHgmf-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22666890/MicrosoftTeams_image_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’ll even burn Destiny’s Tricorn logo into your bread.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dxZjNz"&gt;There’s also a charity angle. Bungie originally promised to explore the idea if its charity stream raised over  $777,777.77 for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and it eventually hit over $800,000. Plus, when the toaster goes on sale, the developer says 10 percent of the profits it generates will go to the research hospital. If you’re looking for a more selfish reason to preorder, however, then the toaster also comes with a free sandwich holder and a Burnt Edges in-game emblem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHcgko"&gt;If the sound of a video game company making a toaster sounds familiar, then you might be thinking of Razer’s toaster which, after years of memes, it claimed it was going to make for real &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/the-razer-toaster-is-going-to-be-a-real-thing/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But despite receiving a wave of publicity, we can’t see any evidence that it was ever released. Someone on Reddit snapped a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/d11dzl/razer_toaster_in_the_razer_store_in_vegas/"&gt;picture of it&lt;/a&gt; in Razer’s Las Vegas store, but there’s no sign it was actually available for purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI2IQb"&gt;Anyway, if you’re someone who sits squarely in the middle of venn diagram labelled “being a massive Destiny fan” and “toaster connoisseur,” then this one’s for you. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419630/toaster-human-design-breville-tech-products"&gt;I’m looking at you Tom Warren&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tamagotchi’s new smartwatch lets you strap a needy digital pet to your wrist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9WiWqUWPxamtO2zvgxLG9R8TT4=/0x0:2159x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471089/msedge_1HBEESX8rM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bandai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DCOSWb"&gt;Everyone’s favorite digital pet, the Tamagotchi, is being reinvented for its 25th anniversary. The new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv1PO-DkTXA"&gt;Tamagotchi Smart&lt;/a&gt; puts the creature into a colorful smartwatch, allowing you to strap your digital pet — and all the chores that come with it — directly to your wrist. &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/new-tamagotchi-is-a-wearable-smart-device-1847119315"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the new device features a touchscreen for petting your little friend, voice recognition for chatting, and a pedometer. Oh, and it can also display the time. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur4d3U"&gt;After their original release of the Tamagotchi in the late 90s, there was a global flurry of enthusiasm, leading to a spin-off anime series, video games, and a movie. The Tamagotchi Smart is fundamentally very similar to the 90s toys, but benefits from 25 years of tech progress. Its screen is color rather than monochrome, and there’s also wireless connectivity for interacting with other Tamagotchis. An &lt;a href="https://toy.bandai.co.jp/series/tamagotchi/smart/topics/detail/2092/"&gt;official FAQ&lt;/a&gt; puts battery life at around 30 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JT6rmTsi76SZ-VfjCqERhUeGEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22666849/msedge_1HBEESX8rM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bandai&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QibAob"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tamagotchis-smartwatch-is-way-cuter-than-apples-1847126266"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tamagotchi’s manufacturer Bandai is initially selling the Tamagotchi Smart via lottery, but the device will go on general sale on November 23rd for 7,480 yen (around $68). Buyers will be able to unlock extra content by plugging in small physical keys, which Bandai is selling separately for 1,100 yen (around $10). There’s no word of an official release outside of Japan just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX3nOq"&gt;Personally, I swore I’d never love a Tamagotchi again after I was forced to watch my first digital pet die during a family road trip in the late ‘90s. The ‘select’ button had fallen off the plastic egg into a public toilet (seriously), which left 8-year-old me unable to feed my little friend. Instead, I had to watch it die slowly as I helplessly cradled it in my arms. That day I swore I’d never open my heart to another digital creature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RkVbU"&gt;Still though, the new smartwatch looks pretty neat, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3qoow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taiwan’s government is letting its tech giants TSMC and Foxconn buy COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Biontech vaccine vial is seen infornt of syringes during a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PxWIRXa1mBoza3zf2Tpfy6Hixqw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69471018/1233487764.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tunahan Turhan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K8zyXg"&gt;Last year, Taiwan was held up as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/10/21171722/taiwan-coronavirus-china-social-distancing-quarantine"&gt;a model example&lt;/a&gt; of how to control the pandemic. Now, with a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-reports-new-rise-domestic-covid-19-cases-2021-05-29/"&gt;rising case-count&lt;/a&gt; threatening the country’s vital tech industry in the middle of a global semiconductor shortage, its government is letting its powerful corporations buy COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf. It’s an unusual workaround, but one that makes sense given Taiwan’s complaints that China &lt;a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-says-beijing-blocked-deal-with-biontech-for-covid-19-shots"&gt;scuppered earlier deals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFkMBZ"&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/TSMC-and-Foxconn-cleared-to-buy-COVID-vaccines-for-Taiwan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-founder-asks-taiwan-allow-vaccine-talks-with-chinese-firm-2021-06-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Taiwanese government said on Friday that it would allow chipmaker TSMC and Terry Gou, billionaire founder of tech assembly giant Foxconn, to negotiate on its behalf with vaccine makers. Both TSMC and Gou (who will be working through his Yonglin Education Foundation) said they hope to buy around 5 million vaccines each from Germany’s BioNTech and donate them to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="On6hHi"&gt;Whether or not this approach will succeed is unclear. “The government thinks that it may be easier for companies to reach out to vaccine makers or distributors to lower the geopolitical interference,” one source told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y5ZKVm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;can he get them to sell sufficient vaccines? Honestly, nobody knows”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pGPnpg"&gt;But Taiwan’s cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng was more cautious, telling reporters: “Even if Mr. Gou can discuss this with the original manufacturer or an agent, can he get them to sell sufficient vaccines? Honestly, nobody knows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acaOhj"&gt;TSMC and Foxconn are lynchpins of both global tech supply chains and Taiwan’s economy. Together, the firms account for more 30 percent of island’s stock exchange by market capitalization, according to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;. The global pandemic has created a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;worldwide shortage in chip supplies&lt;/a&gt;, leading to rising prices and missing stock for everything from PS5s to Teslas. Such problems could worsen if cases spike among Taiwan’s workers, forcing factory shutdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTE2zH"&gt;Taiwan has a population of around 23 million, but only around six percent of the island’s inhabitants have received even a single dose of coronavirus vaccine, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. The work of vaccinating the island has been complicated by geopolitical tensions. China considers the democratically-governed Taiwan to be a breakaway province that it wishes to exert full political control over. The US is one of the biggest obstacles to this integration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyRJ06"&gt;Taiwan’s own government and sympathetic US senators &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/17/why-america-should-help-taiwan-get-vaccines/"&gt;say China has interfered &lt;/a&gt;with the island’s attempts to secure vaccines. In response, the US has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-working-deliver-vaccines-taiwan-short-order-2021-06-17/"&gt;promised to donate&lt;/a&gt; 750,000 shots to Taiwan “in very short order” while Japan has already exceeded this promise, donating 1.24 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/11/japan-injects-vaccine-diplomacy-into-the-taiwan-straits"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nObJL"&gt;With cases of coronavirus rising, though, it seems Taiwan’s government is unwilling to simply wait on the largesse of its geopolitical allies. Instead, it’s hoping that its own corporations can assist in purchasing the much-needed shots.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify acquires podcast discovery specialists Podz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0PnGC8XMqIAjqYO4Oq2Goe8A1Sk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69470963/acastro_180213_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="drwtPp"&gt;Spotify has acquired Podz, a startup whose technology generates preview clips of podcasts, the streaming service &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-06-17/spotify-accelerates-podcast-discovery-with-acquisition-of-podz/"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other services podcasters can use to manually create clips, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; Podz automates the process of finding key moments from episodes using machine learning trained on over 100,000 hours of audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygBlgg"&gt;The acquisition is aimed at improving podcast discovery, letting users browse short clips rather than 30-minute plus podcast episodes. Spotify says this will make it “easier for listeners to find the content they want to listen to, and for creators to be discovered and build a fan base.” Podz tells &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that users on its platform typically follow up to 30 podcasts, up from an average of seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ShtsG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Making it “easier for listeners to find the content they want to listen to”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTHNwi"&gt;The acquisition follows Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;subscription podcasting announcement&lt;/a&gt;, in which it would allow select partners to charge for access to their content. Although Spotify isn’t planning on taking its 5 percent cut of subscription revenue until 2023, eventually it’ll have a direct financial incentive to encourage its listeners to find and subscribe to as many podcasts as possible. Especially since it’s now competing with Apple Podcasts’ own in-app subscriptions, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534960/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-channels-shows-app"&gt;launched this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TevRIx"&gt;Spotify says it plans to integrate Podz’ technology into its platform, and that some of the results should be visible before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Quest update adds multitasking and wireless streaming for original headset</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y42QIm0dET-f9EWBTkJBMLXiTX8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69470886/akrales_190429_3371_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nrQSLO"&gt;Facebook is rolling out its v30 update to the Oculus Quest and Quest 2 VR headsets. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535772/oculus-quest-vr-air-link-wireless-pc-streaming-original"&gt;previewed earlier this week by Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, v30 includes a new multitasking interface for Infinite Office that lets you put multiple apps side by side, including the browser, Oculus TV, Oculus Move, the store, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7QY38"&gt;Like many new Oculus Quest features, it’ll be found in the Experimental section of the settings menu at first. Once multitasking is enabled, apps can be dragged up from the menu bar or the apps library and snapped into position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ghr33H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2QwKws"&gt;The v30 update also enables Air Link for the original Quest headset. Air Link &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400197/oculus-quest-2-air-link-pc-streaming-v28-launch"&gt;came to the Quest 2 in April&lt;/a&gt; and allows you to stream VR games from your PC to your headset wirelessly, as opposed to Oculus Link which does the same thing over a USB-C cable. Original Quest owners could previously stream PC games wirelessly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;with the third-party app Virtual Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9omQ5q"&gt;Other new features include the addition of an accessibility tab to the settings menu that, among other things, allows for height adjustment, so that games can be experienced from a standing viewpoint while seated. Oculus has also added the ability to switch the headset’s built-in microphone between system-wide party chat and the app you’re using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k87zQS"&gt;As ever, the update might not hit your headset immediately due to the staggered rollout process, but Facebook &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fmultitasking-accessibility-improvements-and-air-link-for-quest-1-in-the-latest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator adds beautiful Nordic views in its latest update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p_1ggh8XOX4FJOl7wHdxw0gkzl0=/121x0:1272x767/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469615/flight_sim1700.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator | Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J049db"&gt;Just in time for the launch of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;on Xbox Series consoles next month&lt;/a&gt;, developer Asobo Studios has added some extra details that players will appreciate. World Update V is focused on the Nordic region (specifically Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden), bringing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1405543549232316422"&gt;stunning vistas&lt;/a&gt; to an already visually impressive title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AVPs0J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hgaj4NGVfR0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4VeFIG"&gt;A brief trailer shows the payoff for some extra attention on landscapes (so many fjords) and urban areas with detailed architecture for you to fly around showing off everything from ancient castles to modern stadiums, towers and bridges. According to the team, the new areas include “100 airports and 77 carefully selected points of interest.” You can see Lego House and Frederiksborg Castle in the trailer, along with the Arctic Cathedral and Sarek National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNT1Rc"&gt;The Xbox launch is timed for July 27th, arriving after several updates to optimize the game and even &lt;a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/release-notes-1-16-2-0-sim-update-iv-now-available/"&gt;reduce its staggering initial installation size&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a capable PC you can install this latest update for free — it’s also localized in Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish if you’d like the full Nordic experience — while Xbox One owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-games-on-xbox-one-xcloud-streaming"&gt;wait for cloud streaming&lt;/a&gt; to bring high-end titles their way later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet’s hand-raising feature is getting a more visible animation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86LZ_CVdIRbuu6EQpFUHSMn6jvg=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469597/Google_Meet_1.max_2000x2000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IgVCNN"&gt;Google Meet, Google’s answer to video calling services like Zoom, is getting a collection of helpful tweaks to its &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/06/improvements-to-hand-raise-in-google.html"&gt;hand-raising feature&lt;/a&gt; as part of ongoing updates to Workspace. The new changes, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/17/google-meet-hand-raise/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, include a new hand-raising animation, notification sound, and adjustments to how hosts are made aware of raised hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBA62g"&gt;While the update is minor, for anyone who uses Google Meet in a large group setting or regularly attends webinars, the tweaks will be helpful — plus, the new animation really is nice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZrFhWZNNP8G46g1CT-PRX7OQcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22666118/NewVisualIconAndAnimationWhenSomeoneRaisesHand.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new hand-raising animation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ap8m1Q"&gt;Here’s Google’s breakdown of the changes you’ll notice as the update rolls out to Workspace users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BqOXst"&gt;An updated and improved visual icon and animation on the video tile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9unsK8"&gt;The tiles of people with raised hands may be moved to be more visible in the video grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IOpTFh"&gt;An audio notification for all participants when the first raised hand is raised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k9Olcx"&gt;A clickable notification which shows the number of raised hands and which links to an ordered queue of all participants with raised hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcatlH"&gt;That a participant’s hand will be automatically lowered after they speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mCi3ro"&gt;Google says the new feature will be available for any meeting created by hosts with Workspace Essentials, Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Fundamentals, Education Plus, Nonprofit, and G Suite Business accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGitDO"&gt;For the more exciting changes to Workspace announced at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;I/O 2021 Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll have to wait a bit longer. Google just rolled out Workspace to anyone with a Google account and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532559/google-workspace-chat-officially-available-consumer-gmail-spaces"&gt;enabled its new Chat and Rooms features&lt;/a&gt; (replacements for G Chat and Slack). Bigger changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates"&gt;like smart chips&lt;/a&gt;, which makes all Workspace apps more interoperable and fluid, are still a ways off. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG Mobile returns to India after ban with green blood and a new name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PUBG" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1gGveoX3CyRvMgpbBhID5jdxlBE=/124x0:1474x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69469278/PUBG_Mohawk.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S5R67N"&gt;Massively popular battle royale game &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjt-vv5w5_xAhUBip4KHSMcBVkQFjAAegQIAhAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22350782%2Fpubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3cSh1JYadGTB5sQZIxOuAH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is returning to India after being banned in September 2020, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/battlegrounds-mobile-pubg-returns-to-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. The app is available in early access on Google’s Play Store under a new name, &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds Mobile India, &lt;/em&gt;and with some changes to the game itself, like green blood and a new account system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFTlAP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418120/pubg-mobile-india-ban-118-apps-china-alipay-baidu"&gt;initially banned&lt;/a&gt; alongside hundreds of other apps because of connections to Chinese companies — in this game’s case, it was major video game investor Tencent. At the time of the ban, PUBG Studio (owned by the larger South Korean company Krafton) announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562107/pubg-mobile-india-launch-ban-data-localization-cybersecurity-concerns"&gt;it would relaunch in the region&lt;/a&gt; with new features customized for Indian gamers, including the color change to blood, and framing the game explicitly as a “virtual simulation training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eu9QZb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; writes that beyond modified bodily fluids — part of a long tradition of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/13/20812985/nearly-30-years-ago-mortal-kombats-blood-forever-changed-the-video-game-industry"&gt;censoring depictions of violence&lt;/a&gt; in games — and reminders that the game isn’t real, &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds &lt;/em&gt;seems to be the same as &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. There’s apparently even a way to easily transfer your account from the older game to the new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgjMDx"&gt;The really consequential changes may be less visible. The Indian government’s major justification for the ban was that it had concerns about where users’ data was transmitted, with the idea that it was not comfortable having that data sent to places outside of India (read: China). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdIrjO"&gt;Ahead of its planned relaunch, PUBG Studio announced it was severing ties with Tencent in India and moving the game’s hosting to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/pubg-mobile-plots-return-to-india-following-ban/"&gt;Microsoft Azure data centers&lt;/a&gt; in the country, which may have solved the matter well before any green blood did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sOHPp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9ydXO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFLoQE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDK7Q7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faAbus"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available through Sony’s store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xS5CiNMvEijE7WtcR5T9S8X8bM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467646/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ww7DNc"&gt;More than six months after its initial debut, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; remains as elusive as ever. Sony also expects console shortages to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;stretch into 2022&lt;/a&gt;, however, at 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT, both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition will be available at Sony’s store. &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=hsm0u2oyux&amp;amp;ver=v3-javascript-3.6.3&amp;amp;cver=281&amp;amp;man=PS%20Direct%20Prod%20KU%20Action&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fhardware%2Fps5&amp;amp;kupver=akamai-1.0.2"&gt;You can head to that site right now&lt;/a&gt;, and the page will automatically toss you into the queue to (hopefully) secure a PS5 from the batch being released into the wild today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcPHQX"&gt;Sony says that you don’t need to refresh the page, but make sure that you stick around once the queue begins because it’ll likely ask you at some point to verify that you’re still present, or else you might be booted from the queue. If it’s your first time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;welcome to the needless drama involved with buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVpQBa"&gt;So, what’s the difference between the two models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA6hbH"&gt;The standard PS5 ($499.99) and the Digital Edition ($399.99) are nearly identical, aside from the obvious. The standard console features a UHD Blu-ray disc drive whereas the latter does not, meaning you’ll need to download or stream anything you want to watch or play. The Digital Edition also features a slimmer, lighter build because of this, however, keep in that the size difference is slight. Both consoles also sport an 825GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0F29IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7hBTYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zFuNf"&gt;If you do manage to purchase a PS5, there are a few games and additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony"&gt;accessories we suggest you pick up&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736382577329371434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D Headset&lt;/a&gt;, the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, and the best PS5 exclusive released thus far: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Returnal-PlayStation-5/dp/B08QFPS48J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AasZjK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JTGN3h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nefQI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;In addition to the accessories above, we also recommend buying an &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so gives you access to online multiplayer, a selection of free monthly titles, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to play a host of PlayStation 4 classics on your PS5 at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Crg6Jf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Rfz4Sb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gk4v7b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
