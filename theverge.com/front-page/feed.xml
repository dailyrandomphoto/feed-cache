    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nZotoS"&gt;In addition to designing several new products for people trying to keep germ-free during a pandemic, Targus is targeting iPhone users &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Ftargus-showcases-new-product-range-at-ces-2022-to-empower-a-seamless-life-at-home-in-the-office-or-on-the-go&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with this new Cypress Hero EcoSmart Backpack that has built-in Apple Find My technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cypress Hero EcoSmart backpack includes Apple’s Find My technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="un67rC"&gt;In turn, users can also use their backpack to track a lost iPhone by pressing a button in the backpack. The backpack has an integrated battery that’s replaceable and can be recharged via USB, which Targus claims will provide better protection from thieves than a simple tag. Like the other bags in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fcollections%2Fcypress-with-ecosmart%3Fnarrow%3D%255B%255B%2522Features%2522%252C%2522filter_features_Eco-Friendly%2522%255D%255D%26sort_by%3Dcreation_date%26utm_source%3Dpress_release%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DCES_2022_Product_Roundup&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cypress Hero EcoSmart line&lt;/a&gt;, Targus says this one is built using approximately 26 recycled water bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnhdZV"&gt;Currently, there is no specific release date for the backpack, but Targus says that the new product will be available in spring / summer 2022 for $149.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Nq4w"&gt;Not an iPhone user or don’t want any built-in tracking? Targus is also expanding &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/targus-showcases-new-product-range-at-ces-2022-to-empower-a-seamless-life-at-home-in-the-office-or-on-the-go-301453009.html"&gt;its antimicrobial accessory line&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2022 — a line meant to stand out in a pandemic consumer market in a way that marketing exec Andrew Corkill says will “address productivity, sustainability, and health and wellness initiatives to enable a seamless life.” That includes other backpacks, plus a briefcase, slipcase, and laptop sleeve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CZv7M"&gt;Targus also announced a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Ftargus-and-synaptics-to-introduce-world-s-first-universal-hybrid-dock-with-bio-authentication-via-built-in-fingerprint-id-at-ces-2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866769%2Ftargus-ces-2022-apple-backpack-find-my" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C Hybrid / Universal 4K Quad Dock&lt;/a&gt; with fingerprint ID compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome OS. It supports either single-display 8K resolution output or four 4K displays. It will be available this month as the Dock720 for $442.99 while a Dock710 without enterprise-grade biometrics capabilities will be available for $372.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQgJQO"&gt;Finally, Targus says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225509/targus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic"&gt;the UV-C LED Disinfection Light it announced at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; to keep keyboards clean is now “the world’s first certified disinfection unit for commercial use under UL 962” and will be available in February for $299.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Deere’s self-driving tractor lets farmers leave the cab — and the field</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wb2-0jxzyR_n017uueZkUamC16U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347450/john_deere_autonomous_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-driving tractors could be coming to a farm near you. &lt;/em&gt; | Image; John Deere&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1x2ca"&gt;Agricultural equipment maker John Deere has announced its latest piece of autonomous farming kit: a package of hardware and software that combines machine learning with the company’s GPS-powered auto-steer features to create a “&lt;a href="http://johndeere.com/CES"&gt;fully autonomous tractor&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhiExx"&gt;The technology to support autonomous farming has been developing rapidly in recent years, but John Deere claims this is a significant step forward. With this technology, farmers will not only be able to take their hands off the wheel of their tractor or leave the cab — they’ll be able to leave the field altogether, letting the equipment do the work without them while monitoring things remotely using their smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxgvIe"&gt;“This is not a demo. It’s not a concept machine. It’s something we’ve had in the field with farmers for years and will be taking to production in fall,” Deanna Kovar, vice president of production and precision ag production systems at John Deere, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJVyP5nKPqZfXf4eohKN3kOuJVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144919/john_deere_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Deere&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agricultural automation has been improving slowly but surely over the past decades. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0hx7jt"&gt;This may seem like an unexpected breakthrough, but the farming world has arguably made more consistent progress with autonomous driving than automakers or tech startups, mostly due to the simplicity of the task at hand. Although plowing or seeding a field is certainly a difficult job — requiring farmers to navigate the contours of their land while operating complicated equipment — the driving component is relatively straightforward: operators follow set lines without having to worry about pedestrians or other road users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFuZk1"&gt;Because of this, companies like John Deere have been able to automate many aspects of farm driving over the past decades. Mostly, they offer auto-steer systems which use GPS to locate and guide tractors. Farmers first map the boundaries of their fields, often using beacons or by driving around the perimeter, and the software then plots a route. The driver — sitting in the cab of their tractor — can then oversee this path and correct it if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGGMbm"&gt;“We’re not going from no tech all the way up to an autonomous machine,” says Kovar. “John Deere’s AutoTrac solution has taken the job of steering in the field out of the operators’ hands for almost 20 years now.” Today’s announcement, she says, builds on these solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cqBrQ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not going from no tech all the way up to an autonomous machine.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sQib0S"&gt;The big difference with this new technology is that drivers will now be able to set-and-forget some aspects of their self-driving tractors. The company’s autonomy kit includes six pairs of stereo cameras that capture a 360-degree view around the tractor. This input is then analyzed by machine vision algorithms, which spot unexpected obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciQszh"&gt;“All [farmers] need to do is transport [their tractor] to the field, get it set, get out the cab, and use their mobile phone to ‘swipe to farm,’” says Kovar. “And every eight hours, they return to give it fuel and move it from field to field.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTYDuo"&gt;Although John Deere is presenting this as an autonomous system, it’s worth noting that there are humans in the loop, and not just farmers. When the company’s algorithms spot something unexpected, images from the cameras will be sent to “tele-operators” — essentially a call center of third-party contractors who will manually check if the obstacle is a false positive or if the problem has resolved itself. If it’s a real issue, they’ll escalate things to the farmer via an alert on their mobile app. The farmer can then view the images themselves and decide if they want to plot a new course or check the situation in person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktULCn"&gt;“We’ve trained the algorithm to know that those are birds flying, you don’t have to stop for birds. But if you have, say, a dog in the field, then we’ll stop,” says Kovar. “We don’t want to always alert the farmer because this could be two in the morning. Part of the value of autonomy is allowing farmers to focus on other tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coaTSj7n9OkL3GiGEMhxSPFDato=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144923/john_deere_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Deere&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hardware can be fitted onto recent John Deere tractors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B98Q84Eov1uFZurv9C50sXPEte4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144924/john_deere_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Deere&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pairs of cameras will offer a 360-degree view. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JOY1lT"&gt;This system won’t be able to handle all aspects of tractor work, though. Right now, John Deere is focusing on the job of tillage — preparing soil for cultivation, either by turning over the earth, removing crop residue, or plowing this material back into the field to return nutrients to the soil. This is a “competing priority” job that’s usually done around harvest time, says Kofar, meaning farmers may set it aside in favor of more pressing tasks. That makes it a perfect target for automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyTo82"&gt;Of course, the proof of the pudding is always in the eating, and despite years of testing, there will no doubt be teething problems when it comes to using this technology in farms. Driving a tractor isn’t just about steering round obstacles, and farmers also have to check that their equipment is working and adjust it to environmental changes. Kovar says the company’s software can monitor some of these variables, like checking that individual shanks on tillage tools are still operational, but there are bound to be other issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mZGZE"&gt;The company will be selling its new autonomy package as equipment to be retrofitted onto a number of its more recent tractors. But it has not released pricing — either upfront costs or annual subscriptions (which it charges for its autosteer products). The underlying equipment, though, is already extremely pricy. A John Deere 8R tractor and chisel plow used for tillage will set farmers back hundreds of thousands of dollars. There’s also the contentious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;issue of right to repair&lt;/a&gt;. Deere has been criticized strongly for locking farmers out of their own machines, and adding more computation will only speed this trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mevYoU"&gt;As Kovar says, though, this is just another step in John Deere’s journey towards ever-greater automation in agriculture. “This is a huge fusion of all of the technologies that agriculture has been leveraging for a couple of decades now,” she says. “There’s tons of opportunity for autonomy to stretch all the way through the production cycle, and at John Deere, we’re committed to that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why AT&amp;T and Verizon are feuding with the US government over a last-minute delay to 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cell tower stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFQfQXD93XobDDTim67oWSDgmfY=/0x0:1008x672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347426/cell-tower-san-jose-3-stock-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A long-brewing battle between wireless carriers and airlines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="r0Xcn7"&gt;The day after New Year’s, the CEOs of the two biggest wireless carriers in America sent &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145232/att_letter.pdf"&gt;a very angry letter&lt;/a&gt; to Pete Buttigieg. The companies had been working for years to launch a new portion of their 5G networks, a launch that had been scheduled for December and then unexpectedly pushed back due to vague air safety concerns. Now, the Department of Transportation was asking for more time, just days before the scheduled launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MQLVp"&gt;“In addition to the tens of billions of dollars we paid to the U.S. Government for the spectrum and the additional billions of dollars we paid to the satellite companies to enable the December 2021 availability of the spectrum,” the CEOs wrote, “we have paid billions of dollars more to purchase the necessary equipment and lease space on towers. Thousands of our employees have worked non-stop for months to prepare our networks to utilize this spectrum.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SACOGz"&gt;As of yesterday, the spectrum launch is back on — pushed first to January 5th, then two weeks later to January 19th — but it’s been an unusually rocky road for US wireless carriers, bouncing between regulators at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and increasingly vocal unions for pilots and flight attendants. At the heart of all of it is a nagging fear that the latest round of 5G spectrum will pose a threat to commercial airlines and their passengers. But it’s such a complicated issue that it’s best to unpack it one piece at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OPgr75"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="hAHNLt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is actually getting delayed here? I already have 5G on my phone. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="STgrVH"&gt;Carriers and airlines are fighting over a particular chunk of spectrum from 3.7 to roughly 4.0 GHz – primarily used by AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, sometimes referred to as C-band. (T-Mobile is using a separate mid-band patch at 2.2GHz, so it is largely sitting this fight out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AduITk"&gt;This isn’t all the 5G spectrum, but it’s some of the best parts. The most powerful thing about 5G is the ability to transmit huge volumes of data over these mid-band frequencies, and this spectrum is the main way AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are planning to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jvxMDW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a reason they paid $65 billion for this. They don’t have sufficient mid-band spectrum without it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOOHot"&gt;“There’s a reason they paid $65 billion for this spectrum,” says Public Knowledge’s Harold Feld, who &lt;a href="https://wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/what-the-eff-faa-my-insanely-long-field-guide-to-the-faa-fcc-5g-c-band-fight/"&gt;wrote about the issue at length in November&lt;/a&gt;. “They don’t have sufficient mid-band spectrum without it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPXPMz"&gt;Crucially, we’re at the last step in a very long process. If you bought a 5G-capable phone, you already own a device that can send and receive on those wavelengths, and there are already cell towers that can manage those signals. All that’s left is to turn them on, at which point the C-band airwaves will get a whole lot busier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="J9Bs6A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So… why didn’t they switch them on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iooyzZ"&gt;Airlines are worried those busier C-band airwaves will interfere with their equipment. In particular, they’re worried about radar altimeters — a device that bounces radio waves off the ground to give extremely precise altitude readings. It’s a crucial device for landings, particularly in conditions with limited visibility, and relies on having an empty patch of spectrum to work in. Faulty altimeter readings can also trigger automated responses from autopilot systems, as in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_1951"&gt;a 2009 Turkish Airlines crash&lt;/a&gt; that left nine dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KawXA9"&gt;As a result, the entire industry is deeply uncomfortable with anything that might interfere with altimeters. As an airline pilot’s association put it &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10531182083849/ALPA%20Comments%2017-183%2018-122.pdf"&gt;in a 2018 filing to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;, “the public interest would not be served if tens of thousands of existing aircraft worldwide were inadvertently no longer provided the safety protection enabled by radio altimetry equipment due to interference from adjacent bands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ROUPWl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they’ve tested this, right? Does it actually cause problems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="wxLLKc"&gt;This is the 65-billion-dollar question! As one tech trade group is &lt;a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com/"&gt;fond of pointing out&lt;/a&gt;, this spectrum has already been rolled out in 40 different countries without any resulting altimeter failures, although some of those countries are operating it at lower power levels. But the FCC has spent three years going back and forth with various airline groups on this question, and a lot of them are still worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MRw5TF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s not clear how many faulty altimeters are out there or how they’ll respond to a flood of 5G traffic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7sev5I"&gt;The FCC has a number of measures in place to prevent interference. There’s a full 220 MHz of clearance between the spectrum used by the radio altimeters (which starts at 4.2GHz) and the new 5G spectrum (which ends at 3980MHz). The FCC even carved an extra 20MHz from the 5G holdings when this issue was raised in 2018 to give aircraft extra space. There are also several restrictions on how 5G towers should be configured near airports to avoid flooding the airwaves in areas where planes are landing. In a modern plane with a modern radar altimeter, it should be easy to avoid interference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZveuk"&gt;The problem is, not every aircraft has a modern radar altimeter. Both sides acknowledge that at least some altimeters are affected by signals from outside the intended spectrum bands. To be clear, this is a malfunction — but it’s a malfunction that wouldn’t have been relevant before C-band came online. As things stand now, it’s not clear how many faulty altimeters are out there or how they’ll respond to a flood of 5G traffic. And because even a single interference-related crash would be tragic, it’s hard for airlines to feel secure about the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNOZuy"&gt;For the FCC and wireless industry, the ideal solution would be for the FAA to launch some kind of industry-wide effort to find and replace faulty altimeters. In fact, they would have liked it to launch in 2019, when the rulemaking for the spectrum first began. But that didn’t happen, and it’s unlikely to happen in the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sR7WOS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why don’t carriers give airlines more time to test their equipment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ttkajB"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are coming up against a deadline of their own. 5G-capable phones have been available in the US for two years now, and carriers are expecting a flood of new customers as holiday devices come online. Both networks have some 5G capacity already in place, but without the C-band spectrum, their networks are increasingly stretched thin. In February, AT&amp;amp;T plans to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/offers/network/3g-network-sunset/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shut down its 3G network entirely&lt;/a&gt; as part of the transition to 5G. All that traffic has to go somewhere — and without new spectrum, the result will be spotty, inconsistent service. At the same time, T-Mobile is skating by without any of these problems and has been aggressively marketing its 5G network to draw away customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdvCdf"&gt;Another two weeks isn’t too big of a deal for the carriers, which is part of why they were so eager to accept the deal, but further delays could start to do serious damage to their business plans. With each passing month, the drag on the network gets a little more severe, and the damage from a $65 billion dead asset gets a little harder for shareholders to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlByj9"&gt;“The thing the carriers were really worried about was, how long is this going to go on?” Feld says. “You have this combination of surging demand and concern that you won’t ever be able to use the spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4OymzH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what happens now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5rq6zO"&gt;One way or another, AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon are planning to switch on their networks on January 19th, and the airlines and pilots will be on high alert for the first sign of any interference. The FAA has promised to use the extra two weeks to craft &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/continued_operation/ad/alt_moc/"&gt;an airworthiness directive&lt;/a&gt; for any planes that might be affected, which will stave off the most severe shutdowns or delays. Given the tight timeframe and mounting pressure, it’s very likely the best the agency can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="elxW5Y"&gt;But for observers like Feld, the most frustrating thing is how much time agencies have already wasted without addressing the issue. “This shouldn’t have been a problem. Since the FCC started this rulemaking in 2019, we’ve known this was coming. The steps that are necessary to address this are fairly straightforward,” he told me. “It’s unfathomable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is working with Microsoft on custom chips for next-gen AR glasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wNurw6tJAMWXxYoP9LGQ2snobI=/306x0:2124x1212/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347360/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_2.16.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1641324104.279400"&gt;Qualcomm and Microsoft are partnering to develop a new, customized Snapdragon augmented reality chip that’ll power future AR glasses within Microsoft’s ecosystems. The new partnership was announced at Qualcomm’s CES 2022 keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuUMHN"&gt;“We’re announcing that we’re developing a custom augmented reality Snapdragon chip for next-generation, power-efficient, very lightweight AR glasses for the Microsoft ecosystem,” said Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. “And we’re integrating into that chip platform software from both companies: the Microsoft Mesh platform, and the recently announced Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR development platform. Snapdragon Spaces will be fully integrated into Microsoft Mesh, and this platform will be available for next-generation lightweight glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlGkl8"&gt;The partnership isn’t too surprising: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 850 chip already powers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019"&gt;Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 headset&lt;/a&gt; from 2019. And Qualcomm has only increased its focus and its development of more specifically AR and VR focused chips in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including the Snapdragon XR2&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785469/meta-oculus-quest-2-10-million-units-sold-qualcomm-xr2"&gt;powers the Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft and Qualcomm have also worked together on bespoke chips in the past, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X’s&lt;/a&gt; customized SQ1 and SQ2 processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Cs8iog"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces try to make it easier to get apps ready for augmented reality","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771850/qualcomm-ar-sdk-snapdragon-spaces-mixed-reality-metaverse"},{"title":"Microsoft Mesh feels like the virtual future of Microsoft Teams meetings","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hmpbwe"&gt;The inclusion of support for both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;Microsoft Mesh&lt;/a&gt; and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces XR platform is particularly notable, too. Both platforms offer interesting mixed reality use cases that span multiple devices. Mesh already has a cross-platform VR / AR system for connecting between virtual reality headsets, tablets, smartphones, and PCs, while Spaces aims to specifically integrate Qualcomm-powered smartphones as a “second screen” for mixed reality experiences. And given that Qualcomm specifically highlighted the upcoming chip collaboration as focusing on ultra-light augmented reality glasses, it seems clear that the two companies have big ambitions for integrating future projects into a broader, connected digital world. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OPI announces Xbox-inspired nail polish that unlocks in-game content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RtZHPhiBEmO4cQ1iNrYUebUOxIU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347332/OPI_xbox_Hero_Image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The line consists of 12 colors with cheesy gaming-inspired names.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xbox/OPI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irA3HC"&gt;OPI and Xbox are &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/04/xbox-opi-nail-polish-collection-spring-2022/"&gt;collaborating on a new lineup of gaming-inspired nail polishes&lt;/a&gt; that also unlock in-game content for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;. The vibrant line of 12 nail polish colors is available today in the US at Ulta Beauty. Purchasing colors in the line qualifies for redeemable codes to unlock an exclusive Ford GT livery in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; as well as an armor coating in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Azl6cm"&gt;The OPI x Xbox collection colors have some unique names, ranging from lighthearted and fun to full-on gamer cringe: Quest for Quartz (rose quartz), Pixel Dust (shimmery mauve pink), Racing for Pinks (crème rose), Suzi is My Avatar (pink-nude), Trading Paint (crème apricot), Heart and Con-soul (crimson), The Pass is Always Greener (pastel green), Sage Simulation (sage green), You Had Me at Halo (shimmery blue and actually clever), Can’t CTRL Me (robin egg blue), Achievement Unlocked (what?), and NOOberry (please stop). They are offered in three different formulas: GelColor, Infinite Shine, and Nail Lacquer. Prices range from $10.50 to $13 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKBtXY"&gt;The polishes are at first exclusive in the USA to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-nail-lacquer-collection-pimprod2030261&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866727%2Fxbox-opi-halo-infinite-forza-horizon-5-nail-polish-dlc-news-announcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ulta Beauty&lt;/a&gt;, with global availability at more retailers opening up on February 1st — at which point the redeemable in-game content for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Forza Horizon 5 &lt;/em&gt;goes live&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://terms.snipp.com/Microsoft%20Activation%202005791/Microsoft%20Xbox%20OPI%20US%20-%20Ulta%20Promotions%20T&amp;amp;C's.pdf"&gt;OPI’s terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt; indicate that you have to buy $20 or more of qualifying products to earn the Forza Horizon 5 paint job, and customers have until March 31st to &lt;a href="https://ulta.opixboxrewards.com/"&gt;submit and claim the promo on the entry page&lt;/a&gt;. It is not yet clear how the downloadable coating for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;can be redeemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qDQXVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10961225"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zfJTNu"&gt;This collaboration is one of many &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;cross-marketing tie-ins, where buying toys and collectibles like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820219/guilty-pleasures-ice-halo-dyson-sims"&gt;NERF gun&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HALO-Legends-Master-Spartan-Collection/dp/B085QM1NJX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Master Chief figure&lt;/a&gt; comes with a redeemable code for weapon or armor coatings. Much like the popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Halo-MA40/dp/B08486XL7R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NERF Halo MA40 Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, the best color of the bunch — You Had Me At Halo — is already &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-nail-lacquer-collection-pimprod2030261&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22866727%2Fxbox-opi-halo-infinite-forza-horizon-5-nail-polish-dlc-news-announcement" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold out at Ulta&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone else considering painting their nails just because that shimmery Spartan armor looks so sick?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 add a webcam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xRxzxBtSjyOfYR0l1rtfpQvOB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347292/g14hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, you could play Titanfall 2, but many newer games should run just fine here.&lt;/em&gt; | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8748Cg"&gt;Asus has delivered some big upgrades to its ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15 laptops for 2022. These lines have already been beloved for great battery life, solid performance for gaming and creative work, and aggressive pricing. The most notable feature improvements for both laptops include the Windows Hello IR camera (both laptops previously omitted a webcam), while the G14, with its 14-inch display, has a 50 percent bigger trackpad, along with a jump to 16:10 aspect ratio displays from its previous 16:9 (the G15, which has a 15.6-inch display, is still 16:9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7flGRD"&gt;That’s not all, though. The G14 features up to AMD’s new Ryzen 9 6900HS processor, paired with a Radeon RX 6800S graphics chip. This offers 105W of graphical power by taking advantage of the AMD-exclusive SmartShift and SmartAccess Memory features that allocate power where it’s needed most. In fact, the G14 for 2022 seems to be an all-AMD affair, and it’s far from the only laptop like this announced at CES 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22622823"&gt;Alienware’s M17 R5 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt; might interest you if you want an even more powerful (and bigger) laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLk0upBYfIV--uvJAUCGf49CB5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142273/g14g15together.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2022’s G14 and G15 sitting side-by-side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PfjAmb"&gt;On the other hand, the larger G15 can sport up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 6900HS and up to Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Ti. While that model lacks the SmartShift feature, its GPU can be boosted to pull 120W of power, which should deliver great results that, like last year’s model, will likely defy its thin size. Both the G14 and G15 have MUX switches that’ll let you manually toggle between integrated and dedicated graphics options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYMEga"&gt;Focusing on displays, the G14 has received more love than the G15, featuring (at the high end) a 16:10 aspect ratio QHD display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a peak brightness of 500 nits, 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and Dolby Vision support. A 16:10 1080p panel will also be available, featuring a 144Hz refresh rate, 450 nits of peak brightness, and 100 percent coverage of the sRGB color gamut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUsQyp"&gt;The G15’s display is still in the 16:9 aspect ratio, and it comes in one configuration: QHD resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate, 300 nits of peak brightness, and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. It’s worth noting that this display supports Dolby Vision and adaptive sync. All displays mentioned in this paragraph have a 3ms response time and are Pantone-validated for color accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-roaaPujzF3g5wlnVV42dPqs4Pw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142277/g14topdown.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top-down view of the G14. Note the bigger trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ6uCk"&gt;The G14 and G15 start to look similar when it comes to the configurable RAM, storage, and port selection. Both can support up to 32GB of fast DDR5 memory clocked at 4,800MHz (up to 16GB of it will be soldered to the board, leaving one slot for you to use later on). You can use PCIe 4.0 M.2 2280-sized SSDs in the G14 and G15, though the G14 has only one slot (1TB max), and the G15 features two slots with RAID 0 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S473lJ"&gt;Both laptops feature two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with DisplayPort 1.4 video output and PD charging at up to 100W. You’ll also find two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.0b port, a UHS-II microSD card reader, and a headphone combo jack. The G15 has an RJ45 ethernet port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odn2SP"&gt;As for battery life, Asus asserts that the G14’s 76Wh battery should offer over 10 hours of video playback. If this laptop is anything like previous versions, it should last nearly that long for other tasks, too. The G15’s 90Wh battery can last up to 14 hours by the same metric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Zephyrus G15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTHKiHtFgtLstA6QSpRsBpVwsB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142280/g15animematrix.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the G14 and G15 can be tricked out with the improved Anime Matrix LEDs to give your machine a unique look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7QZXPi"&gt;Asus is giving people the option to buy the stock G14 or G15 or trick it out with the Anime Matrix LED lighting on the lid’s exterior for a flashier design. The company says it has increased the number of LEDs to 1,449 (a 19 percent boost) and “more than doubled” the number of holes in the matrix to allow for better-looking animations. To that end, it has added new animations, virtual pets, and mini games that can be controlled with a mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uW1XQT"&gt;Asus says that these models won’t ship until mid to late 2022, and it didn’t share pricing for any of these models, but we’ll be testing them as soon as the company can accommodate us, so we can report as to whether these are 2022’s definitive gaming laptops or not.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ ROG Flow Z13 is a powerful gaming tablet that can connect to an RTX 3080</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Flow Z13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WSUTXvZQDZP5V4NTLuq6Elkl6TI=/0x0:5935x3957/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347301/z13flow3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just playing co-op Spiritfarer while enjoying Asus-branded chips and soda. Hit me up on my Asus phone if you want to chill.&lt;/em&gt; | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vmw5Or"&gt;The iPad Pro is likely the most powerful gaming tablet you can currently buy — and likely the most popular — but Asus is announcing a Windows-based gaming tablet that may go toe-to-toe in terms of power but will vastly exceed Apple’s tablet in terms of game and accessory compatibility on day one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C9hp"&gt;The ROG Flow Z13 has been announced at CES 2022, and it’s a tablet with a 13.4-inch display and a kickstand. Impressively, Asus will offer configurations of the Z13 with Intel’s Core i9-12900H 45W processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti with 40W of total graphics power — both of which are incredible achievements in a 12mm-thick tablet. The Z13 is essentially a high-end gaming laptop that’s been crammed into a much thinner form factor, complete with a few other trends from CES 2022, like fast DDR5 RAM and PCIe 4.0 storage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Flow Z13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jAQ0dom4aqGzkli-y6pIXOyHsJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142554/z13flow2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The ROG Flow Z13 comes with a detachable keyboard that has per-key RGB backlighting.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YgJkKn"&gt;The Z13 is a wholly original product in Asus’ lineup, but it builds on the coolest feature of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Flow X13, Asus’ 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/a&gt;: being able to connect to an external GPU enclosure for faster, better graphics via a proprietary port. Asus’ XG Mobile eGPU kit can connect to the Z13 to deliver RTX 3080 graphics (or AMD’s Radeon RX 6850M XT, which is new for 2022) via the aforementioned proprietary port that connects directly to the card with a PCIe 3.0 connection with eight lanes for data throughput. That’s cool and all, but it’ll likely cost you a fortune. Last year, my colleague Monica Chin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;priced the kit&lt;/a&gt; including the 2021 ROG Flow X13 and the XG Mobile eGPU at $3,299.99, and the Z13 will likely cost more given its thinner, more ambitious design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCEMQK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This might be Asus’ most ambitious gamble for CES 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D38gk7"&gt;The ROG Flow Z13 can be configured with a 1080p IPS touchscreen with a 120Hz refresh rate and 100 percent sRGB coverage with 500 nits of brightness. For better picture quality, you can get a 4K IPS touchscreen with just a 60Hz refresh rate, which covers 85 percent of the DCI-P3 color space and has a peak brightness of 450 nits. Both screen types are Gorilla Glass-covered, validated by Pantone for color accuracy, and have a 16:10 aspect ratio, and all configurations of the Z13 come with a detachable keyboard that offers per-key RGB backlighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xpxi3h"&gt;In terms of ports, the Z13 has one Thunderbolt 4 port with DisplayPort 1.4 for video output (it taps the integrated graphics) and up to 100W PD charging, while another USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port can handle video (tapping the dedicated graphics) and PD charging. According to materials provided by Asus to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a third USB-C port that can handle video and PD charging, but it doesn’t clarify whether it utilizes integrated or dedicated graphics. To round out the I/O, there’s an eGPU port, one USB-A 2.0 port, a UHS-II class microSD card reader, an HDMI 2.0 port, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSNdY5"&gt;If you want to learn more about the Flow Z13 this week, including getting an in-depth look at the tablet, stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The Z13 will be available in Q1 or Q2 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus has announced the first 42-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus PG42UQ gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAp1l3IiO82PKoIOVPzcecGguYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347296/pg42uqdisplay.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="37cKVH"&gt;At CES 2022, Asus announced the ROG Swift OLED gaming monitor that comes in a 48-inch (PG48UQ) or a 42-inch (PG42UQ) size. Now, 48-inch OLEDs aren’t novel at this point, but the 42-inch size is a brand-new innovation for 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG debuted its 42-inch C2 OLED this week&lt;/a&gt;, and Asus says it’s the first company to adapt a similarly-sized model into its own product. Asus hasn’t shared a release date or price for these monitors, but you know the usual disclaimer about OLEDs: don’t expect them to be cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAgHCw"&gt;The PG42UQ, like the 48-inch model, has a 4K (3840 x 2160) display, an impressive 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio, a lightning-fast 0.1ms response time, a 120Hz refresh rate, 10-bit color with 98 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, and HDR10 support. In terms of ports, both sizes include two HDMI 2.1 ports, two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DisplayPort jack, audio inputs, and a USB hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RZWwr"&gt;Additionally, Asus says that its displays are anti-glare and covered with a micro-texture coating to ensure you see the best color accuracy. These monitors also support variable refresh rate and auto low latency modes, both of which you’ll definitely want in a monitor that’ll likely cost as much as these will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuqIwM"&gt;We’ve reached out to Asus to find out exactly which gaming-focused features these monitors will offer compared to your other option, which is just buying one of LG’s new 42-inch C2 OLED TVs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches iPhone and Android apps for its digital currency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="E-CNY App" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y4e_BYJTjmcR5EJVt5qnFHmWhzg=/0x30:4536x3054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347284/1237534100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Liu Junfeng / Costfoto/Future Publishing via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A2PvGd"&gt;China has rolled out a pilot version of an app that allows users to store and pay with digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, as reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3162094/china-digital-currency-e-cny-wallet-lands-app-stores-ahead-winter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And no, the digital yuan isn’t a cryptocurrency — it was developed by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to replace banknotes and coins; thus, it isn’t a decentralized form of payment, nor will it operate on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnnz0d"&gt;Although it might sound like we already pay with digital cash when we use a credit card or an online payment service like PayPal and Apple Pay, the digital yuan isn’t anything like that. e-CNY is essentially physical cash converted into a digital form, and it’s been in the works since 2014. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/chinas-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, distribution of the digital currency will take place using a two-tier system that transfers e-CNY from the PBOC to commercial banks. Banks will then distribute the currency directly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ROAvbN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As we get closer to the Beijing Olympics, China may use the currency as a way for visitors to easily make payments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lvPyq"&gt;Since the e-CNY isn’t a decentralized currency like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it doesn’t promise the same kind of privacy. The &lt;a href="https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210714-digital-yuan-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work"&gt;Deutsche Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; s&lt;/em&gt;ays it will have “controlled anonymity,” meaning users can choose to conceal their identities from counterparties, but it will still let the authorities monitor transactions for illegal activities like money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdVLGG"&gt;Digital payment apps like WeChat and AliPay already have a strong foothold in China, with around &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17409/most-popular-digital-payment-services-in-china/"&gt;nine in 10 Chinese people&lt;/a&gt; saying they used either app within the past year. It might seem unlikely for the Chinese to want to switch over to the digital yuan, but China has been working hard to promote it. Within the past two years, cities throughout China have even been holding lotteries, distributing a total of &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3104832/chinas-shenzhen-giving-away-millions-sovereign-digital-yuan"&gt;10 million digital yuan (worth about $1.47 million USD at the time)&lt;/a&gt; to people in Shenzen in October 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3112724/chinese-city-hand-out-virtual-red-packets-part-digital-yuan"&gt;20 million digital yuan (or ~$3 million USD)&lt;/a&gt; in Suzhou in December 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/chinese-city-chengdu-launches-6-million-digital-currency-test.html"&gt;40.2 million digital yuan (or ~$6.2 million)&lt;/a&gt; in Chengdu in February 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJDOyi"&gt;Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/digital-yuan-goes-head-to-head-with-alipay-wechat-in-beijing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covered a trade fair in Beijing, where attendees were shown how to sign up for an account, as well as the many ways to use the digital currency — this includes wearables that users can tap against scanners to pay with e-CNY. As noted in the report, users can fill up their AliPay account with the currency, which suggests both forms of payment might have more of a symbiotic relationship rather than a competitive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrnIQy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; even describes how some banks at the event demonstrated how foreigners could sign up for an e-CNY account using their passport and phone number, as well as convert foreign currency to e-CNY. As we get closer to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, this may be a way for China to leverage the currency as a way for visitors to easily make payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGs3Jr"&gt;The new e-CNY app is available on both China’s Android and Apple app stores, but only people in 10 specific cities, including Beijing, Shenzen, Chengdu, and Shanghai, can use it. And as pointed out by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/china-launches-digital-currency-app-to-expand-usage.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the app will be available to use during the upcoming Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is expanding its automotive platforms with new Volvo, Honda, Renault deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZl7gRUjGa16RvHEe_tWIbFLV8Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347236/Snapdragon_Digital_Chassis_Render_01.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm’s vision of a Digital Chassis vehicle | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AK8n7L"&gt;Qualcomm has announced several new expansions of its partnerships with major car companies to provide hardware and software platforms for connected vehicles at CES 2022, partnering with Volvo, Honda, and Renault to add more functionality to their upcoming cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS5BUT"&gt;Qualcomm already has a full suite of automotive platforms, which it collectively calls the Qualcomm Digital Chassis. The goal is to provide automakers with a variety of tools they can use to help make their cars more intelligent and more connected (although companies can pick and choose which of the platforms they want to use). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zk1pmFKkiglDrR1_dyvXC9so1XQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145116/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_2.25.06_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XkRWU4"&gt;Those include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XGdRJf"&gt;Snapdragon Ride, which provides driver assistance and automated driving technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xCqPeH"&gt;Snapdragon Cockpit, for in-car experiences, including SoCs and software solutions for powering multiple displays and audio / video / multimedia &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xj2u6u"&gt;Snapdragon Auto Connectivity, for providing automakers with LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, and GPS solutions for connecting cars to the internet, cloud, and other vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DZoc6L"&gt;Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud Services, which provides security features and a platform for adding over-the-air updates and paid services, in addition to vehicle and user analytics, so that automakers can monetize more of their vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="faJyzL"&gt;Honda, for example, announced at CES 2022 that it’ll be using Qualcomm’s third-generation Snapdragon Cockpit platform to power its Android-based infotainment system in upcoming cars coming to the US in the second half of 2022 and in early 2023. Volvo announced a similar plan at the conference, working with both Qualcomm and Google to offer Android infotainment systems in its upcoming Polestar 3 SUV and Volvo’s planned fully electric SUV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQScAq"&gt;Renault, on the other hand, is planning a more comprehensive adoption of Qualcomm’s Digital Chassis, intending on using Qualcomm’s platforms for connectivity, driver assistance, cockpit experiences, and cloud services on upcoming Renault vehicles. The new deals join existing deals Qualcomm has with other major carmakers, including BMW, GM, Hyundai, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
