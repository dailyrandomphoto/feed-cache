    <title>Apple and nonprofit Common Sense Media team up to provide kid podcast recs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJce2y"&gt;Apple is making it easier for parents to find podcasts to listen to with their kids. The company is teaming up with nonprofit Common Sense Media, which specializes in age-based content reviews, to curate various collections that’ll appear in the Apple Podcasts app in the US and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshowsforkids&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F8%2F22316197%2Fapple-podcasts-common-sense-media-kids-content" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. The initial four themes focus on narrative storytelling, shows that kids themselves recommend, mysteries and dramas, and Common Sense’s “all-time” picks. Programming comes from Tinkercast, American Public Media, WNYC Studios, Rebel Girls, and Nickelodeon, among others, and Common Sense will provide age group recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nljTL"&gt;The collections will be updated monthly with new themes being tied to “important historical and cultural moments,” like Women’s History Month. You’ll see these show suggestions starting today in Apple Podcasts’ main homepage carousel, and then they’ll be available through the Browse tab indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWk5bi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four collections will launch today&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wTL4E9"&gt;Podcasts for children have become increasingly popular as the hype around audio grows and parents look for ways to keep their kids entertained without relying on a screen. Common Sense &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/the-best-podcasts-for-kids"&gt;previously published&lt;/a&gt; podcast recommendations, but this new partnership with Apple represents its biggest commitment to audio programming yet. Hot Pod writer Nick Quah &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/kids-podcasts-see-a-bump/"&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that kid podcast creators saw huge bumps in listenership at the start of the pandemic. One company, Gen-Z Media, said its show &lt;em&gt;Six Minutes &lt;/em&gt;performed about 2 million downloads a month, but during the pandemic, it was on track for 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYSdcw"&gt;Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200272/spotify-kids-playlist-rollout-app-launch-beta"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, place their kid-approved content into separate apps and experiences. Apple seems to think that’s unnecessary for now and that parents can instead rely on themed collections to oversee what their kids enjoy listening to. Apple &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; provide a kid-oriented device experience, but that’s more to give parents control and insight into what their children are consuming than having Apple actually whitelist content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp reportedly working on password-protected encrypted chat backups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLWmI7R-3aW_rlXybIchZHCzvWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928314/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zg9UBA"&gt;WhatsApp is reportedly working to increase the security of its cloud backups with a new password protection feature that’ll encrypt chat backups, making them accessible only to the user. &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-the-qr-code-support-for-ios-beta-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the work-in-progress feature last year, and today it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1368837911471403009"&gt;shared screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of how it could be presented in the service’s iOS and Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNszMl"&gt;“To prevent unauthorized access to your iCloud Drive backup, you can set a password that will be used to encrypt future backups,” one of the screenshots reads. “This password will be required when you restore from the backup.” The app then asks the user to confirm their phone number, and select a password that’s at least eight characters long. Another screenshot warns that “WhatsApp will not be able to help recover forgotten passwords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="POqSWj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;• The chat database is already encrypted now (excluding media), but the algorithm is reversible and it's not end-to-end encrypted. &lt;br&gt;• Local Android backups will be compatible with this feature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chat DB and media will be encrypted using a password that only you know. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WAliLUnF18"&gt;https://t.co/WAliLUnF18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1368839686102384640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="blSNQF"&gt;Although WhatsApp chats are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they’re only visible to the sender and recipient, the service warns that this protection doesn’t extend to online backups stored on &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/about-google-drive-backups/"&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/chats/how-to-back-up-to-icloud"&gt;iCloud&lt;/a&gt;. Once on these servers, the security of the backups is the responsibility of the cloud service providers, who in the past have made them &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zm8q43/paul-manafort-icloud-whatsapp-bad-opsec-witness-tampering"&gt;accessible to law enforcement authorities&lt;/a&gt; with valid search warrants. Encrypting the backups with a password only you know would theoretically prevent anyone from accessing your chat history without your authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBQ5O7"&gt;These latest reports about the feature come as WhatsApp’s reputation has taken a hit from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289595/whatsapp-privacy-policy-app-banner-explanation-telegram"&gt;new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, which has stoked fears that it may store more information with parent company Facebook. Although WhatsApp insists the new policy doesn’t affect the security of users’ personal messages, rival messaging services like Signal and Telegram have seen a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in interest&lt;/a&gt; as users explore other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4F3JW"&gt;WhatsApp declined to comment on the unannounced feature when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;has a good track record of unearthing features before they become official. It’s spotted features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267292/whatsapp-qr-codes-adding-contacts-beta-ios-android"&gt;adding contacts via QR codes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893033/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-beta-self-destruct-privacy-security"&gt;disappearing messages&lt;/a&gt; long before their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309982/whatsapp-contact-qr-codes-animated-stickers-video-call-improvements"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU approves Microsoft’s $7.5 billion Bethesda acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxA1FKWo9liaTlYi4cGanFj2azQ=/1x0:1848x1231/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928256/xboxbethesda.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MRXMdN"&gt;The European Commission has approved Microsoft’s $7.5 billion deal to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; studio Bethesda Softworks. Microsoft’s deal has been &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=2_M_10001"&gt;approved by the EU&lt;/a&gt; without conditions, as it “does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market.” The acquisition required EU approval before Microsoft could finalize the Bethesda deal and bring future games to its Xbox Game Pass subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3OJq7"&gt;“The Commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would raise no competition concerns, given the combined entity’s limited market position upstream and the presence of strong downstream competitors in the distribution of video games,” says a European Commission statement. “The transaction was examined under the normal merger review procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgdwHE"&gt;Once the deal is fully closed, Microsoft’s list of first-party studios will jump to 23, following the addition of Bethesda sub-studios like &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt; developer Arkane, &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein&lt;/em&gt; studio MachineGames, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; maker id Software, and &lt;em&gt;The Evil Within&lt;/em&gt; studio Tango Gameworks. Microsoft appears to be planning to keep Bethesda running separately, with its existing leadership. That approach seems to have worked for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151477/microsoft-minecraft-mojang-acquisition"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11920072/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-2016"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which have all continued to run separately after Microsoft acquired them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5YFNLo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Microsoft bought Bethesda for $7.5 billion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ha3Rnn"&gt;Microsoft originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448877/microsoft-bethesda-softworks-zenimax-acquisition-xbox-game-pass-series-x"&gt;announced its plans&lt;/a&gt; to acquire Bethesda in September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449121/microsoft-bethesda-ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-consoles-exclusives"&gt;promising to honor PS5 exclusivity commitments&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;GhostWire: Tokyo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Games like &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls: Online &lt;/em&gt;will also “continue to be supported exactly as it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbzm1w"&gt;How Microsoft handles future Bethesda titles will come down to a “case-by-case” basis, according to comments from Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer in September. It’s still not clear how Microsoft plans to handle the upcoming space epic &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eiaA8"&gt;Microsoft might not even have to launch future Bethesda games exclusively on Xbox. Just having them on day one on Xbox Game Pass might be a big enough draw in itself for players to subscribe. Xbox gaming chief Phil Spencer has also &lt;a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/phil-spencer-on-exclusivity-monetisation-and-game-development/"&gt;questioned the viability&lt;/a&gt; of exclusivity deals for games recently, and Microsoft’s plans for Xbox are very much centered on Xbox Game Pass and xCloud game streaming reaching millions more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srO87z"&gt;In fact, Microsoft is reportedly planning to outline its plans for Xbox later this month. A “future of gaming” event is rumored to take place on March 23rd, and it could be an ideal opportunity for Microsoft to discuss the future of Bethesda, xCloud on iOS, and its plans for Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq4iqe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, March 8th 6:40AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with full statement from the European Commission. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ next phones will come out on March 23rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd20eAxmGutUK_pqXNBPCzRYU9o=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68928031/Image_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;OnePlus confirms it will launch its 9-series devices later this month. | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJkiMb"&gt;OnePlus has announced an official launch date for its next phones: the OnePlus 9 series will be formally announced on March 23rd at 10AM ET. It’s also confirming a partnership with Swedish camera maker Hasselblad to improve the devices’ camera systems — something that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272052/oneplus-9-pro-hasselbland-quad-rear-cameras-ultrawide-telephoto-zoom-specs"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306934/oneplus-9-launch-event-date-moonshot-pete-lau"&gt;hinted at&lt;/a&gt; previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l81V8D"&gt;Rumors thus far have pointed to the announcement of a OnePlus 9 Pro with curved 1440p 120Hz display, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W fast charging&lt;/a&gt;, and reverse wireless charging. OnePlus’ reference to the “series” product launch would seem to confirm more than one device debuting later this month. There’s also confirmation of 5G, which isn’t surprising in this year of our lord 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07e4P0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies have tweaked the cameras’ color reproduction to look more natural&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0mobt"&gt;As for the Hasselblad partnership, details aren’t super promising. The two companies have agreed to a three-year deal to “co-develop the next generation of smartphone camera systems for future OnePlus flagship devices.” That includes the upcoming 9-series devices. For a start, the companies claim to have tweaked the cameras’ color reproduction to look more natural. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSWx1S"&gt;The 9-series will also use a new Sony IMX789 sensor and offer 12-bit RAW image capture, which the Samsung S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max also include. That’s a nice step forward to capture and retain this large amount of data, and it’s helpful for post-processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct36Tw"&gt;But a standard RAW file — even one that’s 12-bit — still misses out on the benefits of computational photography that you’ll enjoy taking a regular JPEG image with the native camera app. It would be even better to offer something like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW&lt;/a&gt;, which combines the benefits of those computational techniques and RAW image capture. That doesn’t seem to be what OnePlus is describing here, but we’ve reached out to ask and will update this story accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oPalkR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 8 Pro review: big league","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8 review: familiar formula","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SYLFho"&gt;It’s fair to treat this Hasselblad partnership with some skepticism. OnePlus is far from the first smartphone manufacturer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11111022/huawei-leica-collaboration-mobile-photography"&gt;partner with a legacy camera brand&lt;/a&gt;, and results from previous partnerships &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/26/11507260/leica-phone-huawei-p9-no"&gt;haven’t amounted to much&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t even Hasselblad’s first partnership with a phone manufacturer. The company previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/31/12729838/hasselblad-true-zoom-announced-moto-z"&gt;loaned its name to a MotoMod&lt;/a&gt; that was more or less just an underwhelming point-and-shoot camera. In this case, at least, the results of this joint venture will go into the phone itself — not on something that attaches to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo overtakes Huawei to lead Chinese smartphone market for first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KE_veaLpsdmmpG5MQIUdKpc8ApY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68927938/DSCF7293.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M3PqSc"&gt;Oppo has become the best-selling smartphone brand in China for the first time ever, &lt;a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/oppo-becomes-number-1-smartphone-brand-china-first-time-ever/"&gt;according to figures from Counterpoint Research&lt;/a&gt;. Counterpoint’s report says that Oppo managed to capture 21 percent of the world’s biggest smartphone market in January, ahead of Vivo and Huawei, which both achieved 20 percent. Apple and Xiaomi rounded out the top five with 16 percent apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwWkpF"&gt;Oppo’s sales were up 26 percent year on year and increased 33 percent from the previous month. Counterpoint says that the new Reno 5 series had a successful launch due to offering better specs at a lower price point than the earlier Reno 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EktVGt"&gt;But for Oppo to gain market share, someone has to lose it, and the report shows that Huawei’s smartphone troubles are taking hold in China too. Counterpoint says Huawei has increased its focus on the premium market because of component shortages caused by US sanctions, so Chinese distributors have been focusing on other brands for volume. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei’s sale of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, which was also sparked by sanctions, will cut its market share down further, with Honor now considered a competitor as opposed to an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v720FG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOFindX3Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOFindX3Pro&lt;/a&gt;, our latest high-end flagship series. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AwakenColour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AwakenColour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GxerLioEq3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GxerLioEq3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1368748571101597698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8NFzq"&gt;These figures are just for one month, but Counterpoint expects Huawei’s share of the market to continue its decline throughout 2021. Oppo will look to capitalize on the opportunity with the launch of its latest flagship phone, the Find X3 Pro, which is being announced in full on Thursday. If you want an early look, the company just tweeted a teaser that doesn’t leave a whole lot to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZ0zu6"&gt;I had the end of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; spoiled before I watched it because I basically work on the internet and couldn’t quite avoid it, so I won’t do the same to you, dear reader. Let’s just say I didn’t hate it? My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;Julia Alexander writes in her review&lt;/a&gt; that the finale “never lost sight of the story it wanted to tell, the show it wanted to be, and the finale does a mostly decent job of hitting those final notes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1y8rI"&gt;Next up in the MCU, of course, is&lt;em&gt; The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;. After giving us a full trailer during the Super Bowl last month, Marvel dropped a new teaser titled “Coworkers” (it’s over before you know it) so let’s dive in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="stzMaw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdBUjYJ4-GQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IbRaq7"&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWm0XR"&gt;This was supposed to be Marvel Studios’ first big original series for Disney Plus, but it got bumped several times (and yes, one reason was the coronavirus pandemic). The six-episode series takes place after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, with Sam Wilson/Falcon picking up where Captain America left off, and teaming up with Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, starring Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, hits &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyPlusNewTrailers030721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;on March 19th. Can’t wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eDVbkp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnx6-YLXFwg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HRLCET"&gt;Thunder Force&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EFxfsQ"&gt;Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer as a couple of childhood best friends turned 40-something, crime-fighting superheroes? Yes, please. Bobby Cannavale is a villain (who utters the line “how can we not stop two chicks in their forties?!” which, lol) with glowing red eyes (a little unsubtle but OK) and Jason Bateman’s character has crab claws for hands so let’s assume he’s also a baddie (but apparently a Capricorn, not a Cancer). Directed by McCarthy’s husband and longtime collaborator Ben Falcone, &lt;em&gt;Thunder Force&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix April 9th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q01TXT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11wwx5VKThY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2DSsg1"&gt;Voyagers &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W0dRWL"&gt;I watched this trailer a couple of times because I wasn’t totally sure what was going on other than some sexy antics and people taking a drug referred to as “blue.” And also Colin Farrell. Also they’re in space. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/video/voyagers-trailer-colin-farrell-tye-sheridan-lily-rose-depp-blast-off-in-psychedelic-space-trip/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; describes &lt;em&gt;Voyagers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a “sci-fi YA bacchanalia,” so it seems I was on the right track. &lt;em&gt;Voyagers&lt;/em&gt; was written and directed by Neil Burger, who also directed the YA staple &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to Farrell, &lt;em&gt;Voyagers&lt;/em&gt; stars Lily-Rose Depp, Tye Sheridan, and Fionn Whitehead, and is due in theaters April 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6V7pJp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-rw2cxFVLg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FxIptT"&gt;Without Remorse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Gnv5cc"&gt;Michael B. Jordan stars as Navy SEAL John Kelly, who is seeking revenge on Russian soldiers who attack him and kill his pregnant wife. Without Remorse is based on the 1993 Tom Clancy novel, and is a spinoff from Clancy’s &lt;em&gt;Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt; series (note that Harrison Ford, John Krasinski, Alec Baldwin, Ben Affleck, and Chris Pine have all played Ryan in various films, so yeah, it’s time to get a new Clancy character in the mix). Brett Gelman, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Jamie Bell star in &lt;em&gt;Without Remorse&lt;/em&gt;, which is directed by Stefano Sollima and comes to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; Video on April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google HR reportedly advised mental health leave in response to complaints of racist or sexist behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2b51wk3MJ5v0UcM0lETOLfX6i8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68926316/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IFuzJs"&gt;Several current and former Google employees say the company’s human resources department would often suggest mental health counseling or leave in response to complaints about racist or sexist behavior in the workplace, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-advised-mental-health-care-when-workers-complained-about-racism-n1259728"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBj8L6"&gt;The workers described encounters with coworkers that included racist comments about skin color and hairstyles, as well as sexual harassment. When they contacted Google’s human resources department, each was encouraged to take mental health leave, even when their complaints were unrelated to mental health concerns, according to &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ee9qYa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Timnit Gebru was fired from Google — then the harassers arrived","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gdZRKY"&gt;The report follows the December firing of Google AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru, who refused a manager’s request to retract a paper that described the dangers of language models like the ones Google relies on to power its search engine. Gebru wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv&lt;/a&gt; describing her frustration over the paper, and mentioned her doubts about Google’s commitments to diversity and inclusion. She says Google told her the email was “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” Google’s head of AI claimed Gebru resigned, which she has vehemently disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEk5bs"&gt;And April Christina Curley, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/second-top-black-female-google-employee-says-she-was-ousted-n1252277"&gt;Black woman who worked as a diversity recruiter&lt;/a&gt; for Google, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealAbril/status/1341135824730013696"&gt;said she was fired in September&lt;/a&gt; after being denied promotions and having her pay cut, despite her strong work performance and her successful recruitment of hundreds of students from historically Black colleges and universities to Google’s engineering department. Curley told &lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt; she was also encouraged to take mental health leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k94uS1"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment Sunday, but a spokeswoman told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; that “all concerns reported to us are investigated rigorously, and we take firm action against employees who violate our policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuPj25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvqeVM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple mixed-reality headset likely coming sometime in 2022, analyst predicts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GM6j7JAfkcWWDb-2Kqv5qjSxH0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925839/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rC9zwg"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts in a new research note that Apple will release a “helmet-type” mixed reality headset next year, augmented reality glasses in mid-2025, and an AR contact lens product by 2030-2040, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLmg9"&gt;“We foresee that the helmet product will provide AR and VR experiences, while glasses and contact lens types of products are more likely to focus on AR applications,” Kuo writes in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAGYsV"&gt;While several prototypes of Apple’s mixed reality headset weigh between 200 and 300 grams, Kuo says, if Apple can solve some technical problems the headset could end up weighing between 100 and 200 grams, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reported. He added that the headset will likely be priced in the $1,000 range in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERZ1mP"&gt;The headset will be able to offer an immersive experience Kuo says will be “significantly better” than those on the market now, with Sony micro-OLED displays, and should be able to run independently of an iPhone, “more like a portable product” than a mobile one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8b5abT"&gt;Kuo’s note is mostly in line with other predictions of a headset &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;hitting the market sometime in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but with the price tag closer to $3,000. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Apple was using a fabric mesh material to reduce the weight of the headset, and had a rendering based on “internal Apple images of a late-stage prototype” that showed what the headset might look like. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is expanding its Full Self Driving beta to more drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjcbGl3YN-MVwupcqS-ueHAg8YA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925714/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sHoO9G"&gt;Tesla is expanding its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta, CEO Elon Musk said, doubling its size with a new software update, and eventually increasing the number of participants tenfold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S441d"&gt;“Still be careful, but it’s getting mature,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368017749851598850?s=20"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Friday. He said Saturday that Tesla would add a “download beta” button to Tesla displays in the coming days “due to high levels of demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iiLwMh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days &lt;a href="https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG"&gt;https://t.co/D6M3ZiMarG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1368329387733512193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hOxxvV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527577/tesla-full-self-driving-autopilot-beta-software-update"&gt;Tesla first introduced the FSD beta in October&lt;/a&gt; to vehicle owners in its Early Access Program. At the time, Musk said the company was handling the software update “very cautiously.” Drivers still are expected to keep their hands on the steering wheel and should be prepared to assume control of their Tesla at any time. Tesla uses the data from the FSB beta to improve performance, and &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/05/elon-musk-tesla-doubling-size-full-self-driving-beta-program/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Musk said last month there were about 1,000 vehicles in the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FofUkD"&gt;Musk noted that in Tesla’s case, the term “beta is used to reduce complacency in usage and set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested by Tesla simulation and QA drive teams.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUACv"&gt;He added that availability of the FSD beta will vary by region, due to what he called regulatory approval delays and Tesla’s own internal development and testing. Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1368249032783491079?s=21"&gt;director of AI tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla owners interested in participating in the beta should email earlyaccess@tesla.com,  which he says the company is using to coordinate the program&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom King’s Vision comics are the perfect follow-up to WandaVision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPw5KBlv6BG4uqk8z5WNrLaO3GY=/0x2:975x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68925488/vision.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6wu9V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This weekly Verge column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bivWz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s season finale has hit Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’ve got a hankering for more surreal suburban comic book drama, look no further than &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt;, a 12-issue run from writer Tom King and artist Gabriel Hernandez Walta, which explores further the idea of a superhero trying to step back and start a family — no matter the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQefD6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; is a 12-issue comic series. While it lightly ties into the character’s past history over decades of comics, it’s largely a standalone story: Vision moves to the DC suburbs, and (literally) makes a family: a wife, Virginia, and two teenage kids, Viv and Vin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmuT7m"&gt;Issue one drops readers right into the mix alongside the newly minted synthezoid family. Vision is trying to juggle his work as an Avenger (and as the superhero group’s government liaison) and as a new father and husband; Virginia works to fit into the neighborhood; and the twins struggle with teenage drama of trying to fit in at school (which is particularly hard given their robotic nature and superpowers). Later issues also include Sparky, a particularly adorable synthezoid dog. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlpKp3XkG8WoorLhshA7V_WduLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348250/vdc1250_107_comp_v004_r709_a3f29eea.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GHAMCj"&gt;It’s the kind of series that sees Vision battling a gigantic monster alongside the Avengers while also chatting on the phone with Virginia to sort out drama with the twins at school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXoa9R"&gt;But throughout it all is a creeping sense of horror and dread, helped by an unseen narrator that promises throughout the issue that Vision’s seemingly perfect suburban life will end in tears. Things start out relatively benign, like neighbors who are unnerved by the family or a mean spray-painted slogan on the garage, but things quickly devolve into murder cover-ups as Vision and his new family start to get stuck in a web of lies, misunderstandings, and revenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2DVYM"&gt;If you enjoyed the slow burn of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeTomKingComics030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WandaVision&lt;/a&gt;, with super-heroic drama sandwiched between an unnerving illusion of home tranquility, &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; #1 (and the rest of the run) should offer plenty more fodder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dthY6X"&gt;The series is great for newcomers to Vision as a character, too: interspersed across the run is a reexamination of pivotal moments in the artificial hero’s career, including his relationship with Wanda, their desire for a family, his time as a familiar-looking White Vision that has lost all his memories, and more. For MCU fans that are more familiar with Vision’s on-screen origin, it’s a good look at the original version of the character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVe3Mp"&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Vision&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling look at the foibles and follies of people, and an examination of what someone would be willing to do to protect their family. What could be more human than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yhH1r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who’s it by?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vision &lt;/em&gt;was created by writer Tom King (also known for his recent run on &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; and his acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Mister Miracle&lt;/em&gt; series), artist Gabriel Hernandez Walta, and colorist Jordie Bellaire.&lt;/p&gt;
