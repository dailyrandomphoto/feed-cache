    <title>Rimac takes over Bugatti from VW in powerhouse electric supercar deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJNC5Z3NQbk-K2G7x0KlxbuQXAU=/245x0:7571x4884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542819/Bugatti_Rimac_4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pRkwgd"&gt;Croatian electric supercar startup Rimac &lt;a href="https://www.rimac-automobili.com/media/press-releases/rimac-and-bugatti-combine-forces-in-historic-new-venture/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was taking over Bugatti from Volkswagen to form a new company called Bugatti Rimac. The news was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/56be5f08-fe6e-481f-ba6d-71ef49d2cfc4"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk90BC"&gt;Bugatti Rimac will be led by Mate Rimac, who founded the company in 2009 in a garage as a one-man operation. Over that period, Rimac has become a highly desirable brand, with many legacy automakers calling upon the startup to help build their own electric supercars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR13b2"&gt;It’s not much of a question why that is. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463499/rimac-nevera-production-c-two-concept-hypercar"&gt;Rimac released the Nevera&lt;/a&gt;, a quad-motor, 1,914 horsepower demonstration of electric absurdity, with a top speed of 258mph and an ability to leap to zero to 60mph in less than 2 seconds. The Nevera is expected to be the fastest sports car ever made, a title previously held by the Bugatti Chiron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9KFswX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under the deal, Rimac will own a controlling 55 percent stake in Bugatti&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yIVCx8"&gt;Under the deal, Rimac will own a controlling 55 percent stake in Bugatti, the 112-year-old French brand known for its aggressively priced supercars like the Chiron and Veyron. VW’s Porsche brand will own the remaining shares in Bugatti. (Even though Porsche owns some stock in Rimac, it’s total ownership will not give it a controlling interest in Bugatti, the companies told &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qp7FPN"&gt;Volkswagen has owned Bugatti since 1998, when it bought the sports car brand for $50 million after acquiring Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini. This was an all-stock deal, meaning no money changed hands, according to Porsche boss Oliver Blume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSlOar"&gt;Rimac Group will own both Bugatti Rimac and Rimac Technologies, an offshoot of the company focused on the development, production and supply of battery systems, drivetrains and other EV components. Over the years, Rimac has supplied automotive components to Porsche, Hyundai, and, yes, Bugatti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tImhT"&gt;“Bugatti and Rimac will both continue as separate respective brands, retaining existing production facilities and distribution channels,” Rimac says. “Bugatti Rimac represents the company that will develop the future of both Bugatti and Rimac vehicles, by joining resources and expertise in research and development, production, and other areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFK5ey"&gt;Both companies will retain their respective headquarters, but Rimac plans to eventually merge its workforce at the planned $200 million campus in Croatia, which is set to open in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpfS1O"&gt;“This is a truly exciting moment in the short, yet rapidly expanding history of Rimac Automobili,” Mate Rimac said in a statement. “We have gone through so much in such a short space of time, but this new venture takes things to a completely new level. Rimac and Bugatti are a perfect match in terms of what we each bring to the table. As a young, agile and fast-paced automotive and technology company, we have established ourselves as an industry pioneer in electric technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbNasi"&gt;Rimac said Bugatti would have an electric model this decade but would still produce hybrid models by the end of that period. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb has blocked tens of thousands of bookings in party crackdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, an Airbnb logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XOBiaMzQNTFXU0NFYSbiIvArdxg=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542637/1231638711.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6q7aFD"&gt;Airbnb has blocked over 50,000 suspicious bookings across 15 US cities as part of a crackdown on parties in its properties during the pandemic. These include 7,000 in Dallas, 6,000 in San Diego, 5,100 in Charlotte, 3,500 in St. Louis, 3,000 in Columbus, and 2,700 in New Orleans, The company’s head of trust and safety communication Ben Breit tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFwQE4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/04/airbnb-blocks-young-adults-from-renting-denver-party-homes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Denver Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’s blocked 5,000 bookings in Phoenix, 4,500 in Las Vegas, 4,500 in Seattle, 2,600 in Denver, 2,600 in Portland, 1,800 in Salt Lake City, and 1,500 in Albuquerque. &lt;a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/airbnb-says-efforts-to-crack-down-on-parties-are-working-in-cincinnati/36869789"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WLWT5&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that 2,000 bookings were blocked in Cincinnati, while 3,800 were blocked in Austin, &lt;a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/party-crash-airbnb-blocked-3800-risky-reservations-in-austin-area-over-last-year/"&gt;according to KXAN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpWmku"&gt;The numbers show the scale of Airbnb’s enforcement action, and follows a total global ban on parties &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-global-party-ban/"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; to prevent its rental properties becoming an alternative to local bars and clubs forced to close due to the pandemic. “Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health,” the company said at the time. The ban was an expansion of existing rules prohibiting dedicated “party houses,” which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1190675126594879489"&gt;came into force in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WkT9Iu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instituting a global ban on parties and events is in the best interest of public health”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MIxYXH"&gt;Breit outlined to &lt;em&gt;The Denver Post&lt;/em&gt; which kinds of bookings its system has been automatically blocking in the US &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/strengthening-our-safety-commitment-to-u-s-hosts-and-communities/"&gt;since July last year&lt;/a&gt;. “If you are under the age of 25 and you don’t have a history of positive reviews, we will not allow you to book an entire home listing local to where you live,” Breit said. However, other bookings which make less sense for party locations would still be allowed. Trying to rent in a distant city is ok, for example, as is renting a smaller location more locally. Airbnb is now using this particular system across the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASKpT5"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/#:~:text=we%20believe%20it%20worked.%20those%20weekends%20were%20quiet%2C%20and%20these%20initiatives%20were%20well-received%20by%20our%20host%20community."&gt;believes its ban has worked&lt;/a&gt;, and said that major events like Halloween and New Year’s Eve were “quiet” as a result. In Denver specifically, &lt;em&gt;The Denver Post &lt;/em&gt;reports that complaints about short-term rental properties halved between January and May this year compared to the same period in 2020, though it’s unclear how much of this can be attributed to Airbnb’s policies versus a more general decline due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNvlSx"&gt;Although vaccines are continuing to roll out across the world, Airbnb is showing no signs of relaxing its rules, and recently said it would be extending its ban on parties &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-extension-of-party-ban-through-end-of-summer/"&gt;through to the end of summer 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It explained why as part of its “summer of responsible travel” &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/"&gt;announcement in April&lt;/a&gt; when it cited warnings from public health experts about the continued risks of mass gatherings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLDs5n"&gt;The automatic blocking of suspected party bookings is just one part of the company’s crackdown. Other elements include providing discounted noise detection devices to hosts and a 24/7 neighborhood support line in the US, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu9rtW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOR81x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk just now realizing that self-driving cars are a ‘hard problem’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Elon Musk Receives Axel Springer Award" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/noSF6rr8lGHdXNfmjLhvXS_YBVY=/0x87:4000x2754/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542574/1229901940.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZNPnP"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk is finally admitting that he underestimated how difficult it is to develop a safe and reliable self-driving car. To which the entire engineering community rose up as one to say, “No duh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aX0R2K"&gt;Or at least that’s how it should have happened in a just world. Instead, all the Tesla sycophants and ass-kissers on Twitter told Musk to keep up the good work, that they believed in him, and encouraged him to hurry up and roll out the latest version of his “Full Self-Driving” software that, it’s worth pointing out, does not enable a Tesla vehicle to drive itself without input from the driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ey3ddg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk has a long history of over promising and under delivering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N5rmDB"&gt;Musk has a long history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;over promising and under delivering&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to his company’s so-called “Full Self-Driving” software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17449076/tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-elon-musk"&gt;He did it in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when he promised that the “long awaited” V9 (Version 9) would begin rolling out in August. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;He did it again in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyWRd9"&gt;He was back at it again this past weekend, promising that “FSD 9 beta is shipping soon,” with an added “I swear!” just in case you had any doubts about his solemnity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JB87Cs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Haha, FSD 9 beta is shipping soon, I swear!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1411280212470366213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTkYsS"&gt;There’s no question that Tesla is more willing than its competitors to test beta versions of its Autopilot driver assist feature on its customers in the interest of gathering data and working out any bugs in the system. And Tesla customers are mostly fine with this, routinely flooding Musk’s mentions begging to be white-listed for the current version of Full Self-Driving. This has helped contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/autopilot.html?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tesla’s public reputation&lt;/a&gt; as a leader in autonomous driving, despite its vehicles continuously falling short of what most experts would agree defines a self-driving car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKzE7"&gt;Tesla says Autopilot is safe — it releases quarterly reports with selectively reported data that it says proves this — but that it also requires constant input from the driver in order to work. Meanwhile, AV companies like Waymo have real driverless vehicles on public roads giving rides to passengers. Waymo, like practically every AV company, uses a combination of different sensors, like radar, lidar, and cameras, to ensure there are redundancies in case any system failures. Tesla recently switched to a camera-only sensing system. The contrast between Tesla and every other company pursuing self-driving technology couldn’t be more stark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1RKBgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I, for one, am all for Musk taking as long as he wants&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nTXOkC"&gt;I, for one, am all for Musk taking as long as he wants with the release of V9. Let the cake bake for as long as it needs, in my opinion, especially after &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4655186671568775?#&amp;amp;video"&gt;viewing videos like the one to just come out of China&lt;/a&gt; of a Tesla Model 3 in Autopilot utterly failing to take a sharp turn and crashing into a ditch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bboT68"&gt;An anonymous Twitter user who uses the handle @greentheonly to post “hacks” of Tesla’s Autopilot, recreated the scenario to demonstrate how the company’s driver assist feature struggles with these sharp turns. With an overlay of Tesla’s Autopilot display running in the corner of the screen, greentheonly shows how the vehicle “actually outputs various alerts before the eventual ‘take over we are giving up.’” Other times, the car actually slows down enough and manages to take the turn safely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0jaLkX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So in regards to the recent Chinese crash with video where AP exits roadway in sharp turns:&lt;br&gt; I long planned to do a demo of a similar condition but always forgot and I guess better late than never.&lt;br&gt;It's actually really easy to reproduce&lt;a href="https://t.co/B2Ip0G17Ur"&gt;https://t.co/B2Ip0G17Ur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— green (@greentheonly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1411754065277636615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkXl45"&gt;A system that fails to take a sharp turn in “half the cases” should not inspire a great amount of confidence! Quite the opposite actually. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/u-s-safety-agency-reviewing-23-tesla-crashes-three-from-recent-weeks-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;The number of open investigations&lt;/a&gt; into vehicle crashes involving Tesla Autopilot seems to be growing in inverse relation to customer expectations about Musk’s ability to deliver on the promises he’s been making (and breaking) for years now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g38sAa"&gt;Musk isn’t alone in coming to the realization that self-driving cars are hard. Nearly the entire industry was predicting that by now ours roads would be swarmed with self-driving cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;only to later admit&lt;/a&gt; they underestimated how complicated it was to get cars to drive themselves safely and reliably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bStvYa"&gt;To which we can now say to Musk, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6wRZCV7naE"&gt;“Welcome to the party, pal.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why roads in the Pacific Northwest buckled under extreme heat </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wfj5yRWyxiqvAVmuyRywokOed9I=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542359/E4_yA3mVoAYgzsv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A road that buckled in the recent heat.  | Washington State Department of Transportation North via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/wsdot_north/status/1409540967753936897" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6qGOXx"&gt;During last weekend’s &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/weather/2021/06/63-people-died-in-oregon-heat-wave-state-medical-examiner-says.html"&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; heat wave, some roads in the Pacific Northwest buckled. Workers ventured out in blistering conditions to put cracked concrete and asphalt byways back together. Steel drawbridges were &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/2995816/seattle-bridges-cool-baths-heatwave/"&gt;doused with water&lt;/a&gt; to make sure they wouldn’t swell shut under the oppressive heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asgJXs"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547454/2021-heat-wave-temperature-high-heat-dome"&gt;heat dome&lt;/a&gt; that sat over the region provided a brutal stress test of i&lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/likely-heat-caused-crack-closes-north-denver"&gt;ts roadways&lt;/a&gt;, some of which couldn’t withstand multiple days of record-breaking temperatures. It’s something that’s happened before, in &lt;a href="https://www.king5.com/article/traffic/when-roads-blow-up-how-heat-could-play-a-role-in-pavement-durability/281-e88b357d-dfe6-4592-93e8-62e0960b5944"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wqow.com/2021/06/04/dot-watch-out-for-road-buckles-in-heat/"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/post/long-term-heat-wave-causing-pavement-damage"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, and anywhere else experiencing extreme heatwaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="moYwoG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's an example of how heat is causing some road pavement to buckle. Our crews are hard at work this morning fixing SR 544 in Whatcom County, trying to get it back open by afternoon. &lt;a href="https://t.co/53XoBDBOMZ"&gt;https://t.co/53XoBDBOMZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WSDOT Traffic (@wsdot_traffic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsdot_traffic/status/1409543888403009539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMCZ8r"&gt;“You can design something to work in a very hot temperature or not. That’s not the problem.” Steve Muench, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Washington says. The problem is that the current heat defies engineering expectations. Fixing that bigger problem will take engineering, planning, and a whole lot of public willpower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2YFtzc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can’t these roads handle the heat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mFw1TI"&gt;Different kinds of roads behave very differently under heat. In the US, roads are typically made of one of two materials — asphalt or concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63PS2k"&gt;Concrete roads, Muench says, are generally made of portland cement. To make something like a highway, it gets formed into big slabs, which can be about 15 feet long and four feet wide. As temperatures fluctuate, these big slabs of concrete expand and contract. (How much they expand or contract is usually determined by what kinds of crushed rocks make up the cement.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ACVuw"&gt;All that is normal. Usually, there’s just enough space in between the slabs so that the expansion (in hot weather) and contraction (in colder weather) passes completely unnoticed by the average driver. But when it gets unseasonably hot, some of those slabs of concrete start running out of elbow room, especially if bits of sand or other debris have gotten into the cracks between the slabs.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FdP9Cf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heat = expansion. Here's a look at a concrete panel that popped up on NB I-5 at I-405 in Tukwila. Crews are removing the damaged panel and filling it back in. No estimated time for getting these lanes and ramp back open. Fortunately, not much of a backup at the moment. &lt;a href="https://t.co/OLd1Ewf6Kt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OLd1Ewf6Kt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WSDOT Traffic (@wsdot_traffic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsdot_traffic/status/1409313718328954883?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uBqoKx"&gt;“When it gets really, really abnormally hot, like it hasn’t been that hot before in quite a long time, it expands so much that it runs into the adjacent slab. There’s no more room to expand, they just push up against each other and then they pop up” Muench says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF8GbP"&gt;Asphalt is a different beast entirely. “Asphalt is a viscoelastic material, which is temperature-dependent. So, the hotter it is, the more fluid-like it is,” Muench says. If it gets hot enough, some asphalt roads can become soft or deform like Play-Doh, forming ruts when cars and trucks drive over them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWXI3N"&gt;Both asphalt and concrete roads &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;be designed to withstand heat. “We already know how to adjust materials to behave in hotter places,” Muench says. “That’s why Phoenix isn’t falling apart — it’s not Armageddon there because it’s hotter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UJdyT"&gt;The problem is that when some of these roads in Washington state were being designed, using those materials or design techniques would have been overkill — the area doesn’t normally get as hot as Phoenix, so there was no need to build with extreme heat in mind. Now, that calculus might be changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BHCz3J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for a future that looks nothing like the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JyuXma"&gt;When engineers design roads, they can look at the historical weather records for an area and figure out what’s normal. How much rain does this place get? What are the extremes of heat or cold? What are the chances that the nearby river will flood in the next 50 years? All that information can inform which materials and designs the engineers pick out. But it might not be enough anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpO2F3"&gt;“With climate change, you’d have to think very carefully about that and go: ‘Should I really be designing something based on information in the past which may no longer be relevant? Or should I design it based on what we project for the future?’” Muench says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L83nnO"&gt;Roads last for a long time, so building for the future starts to make a lot of sense. Engineers can use climate models to predict how things might change over time and build for a future that’s hotter, or wetter, or drier than anything seen in the weather records of the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FenFWC"&gt;Even roads developed based on those models won’t be perfect. “You can’t design for everything. Some things just break your infrastructure,” Muench says. When a massive storm or an earthquake or any other disaster hits, some things will break, no matter how well-designed they are. At that point, Muench says, the question becomes how do you recover from that quickly. That requires different sets of resources and planning, like making sure materials are available and workforces are trained to respond immediately. Those contingency plans are vital during major disasters so that when the worst happens, a community is ready to face it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q11Pn8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t design for everything. Some things just break your infrastructure.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pfHn51"&gt;Building for the future and prepping for future emergencies are both possible. We have the information and the technology to make it happen. The bigger question, Muench says, is whether people are willing to put the money and resources into infrastructure that can withstand the coming storms, both literal and figurative. “I kind of hope that we’re kind of crossing that bridge —  no pun intended — to where we might be willing to spend a little effort, time and money on these kinds of things,” Muench says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgZctf"&gt;As it is, many transit departments across the country have dealt with shrinking budgets as they try to hold together aging infrastructure that was built for a different climate. Future planning is important but often takes a backseat to more immediate concerns, like tending to heat-stressed roads as they buckle. Crews go out, repair the concrete slabs or asphalt, and get traffic flowing again. It’s not a permanent fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkZC08"&gt;“It’s just sort of wait for something to break and then fix it when it breaks,” Muench says. “The bigger solution is trying to get ahead of the curve and think about what’s coming in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFigYV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZV2Pkm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andy Jassy officially takes over as Amazon CEO from Jeff Bezos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Web Services Head Andrew Jassy Speaks At The AWS Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XfW9T69iC50fkbfvLLXu-qNn8xE=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69542025/670451728.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RhFUhy"&gt;Jeff Bezos, who has served as the CEO of Amazon since founding the company exactly 27 years ago on July 5th, 1994, has officially stepped down from the role. Andy Jassy is now listed as the company’s CEO on its &lt;a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/officers-and-directors/default.aspx"&gt;investor relations website&lt;/a&gt;, after previously having run Amazon Web Services since 2003, while Bezos is listed as Executive Chair. The July 5th handover date was previously announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455126/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-jeff-bezos-july-5-birthday"&gt;shareholder meeting in May&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ia2by"&gt;It’s an important moment for Amazon, which has had the same CEO for the entirety of its existence. Under Bezos’ leadership, the company survived the dot-com bubble bursting in the late 90s to become one of the world’s most prominent technology companies. Amazon currently dominates online commerce in the US and parts of Europe, and serves as a backbone to much of the modern web thanks to Amazon Web Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AsHIdp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The end of a 27-year tenure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkSxW4"&gt;Bezos’ successor, Andy Jassy, joined the company shortly after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1997, and has led AWS since the team was founded in 2003. He was officially named the division’s CEO in 2016. At the end of 2020, AWS controlled around a third of the total cloud computing market, &lt;a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-ends-2020-high-while-microsoft-continues-gain-ground-amazon"&gt;according to Synergy Research&lt;/a&gt;, which is about as much as its closest rivals Microsoft and Google, combined. Jassy’s route is similar to that of current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who previously ran the company’s Azure cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWVInG"&gt;While Amazon’s share price has seen remarkable success under Bezos’ leadership, its labor practices, not to mention the former CEO’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246203/data-visualization-billionaires-wealth-inequality-jeff-bezos-net-worth"&gt;extreme wealth&lt;/a&gt;, have been the focus of sustained criticism. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers have said the company’s high productivity targets take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;physical toll on employees&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; recently alleged that Bezos paid no federal income tax in 2007 or 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV0zDq"&gt;Bezos is handing Jassy a company with ambitions extending far beyond electronic books. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is also a company that’s willing to make big bets on new areas of business. Amazon is a sizable player in consumer tech thanks to its range of Kindle, Echo, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220960/amazon-eero-acquisition-announced"&gt;Eero&lt;/a&gt; devices, as well as general consumer goods under its Amazon Basics label. It has an expanding presence in physical retail after its acquisition of Whole Foods, and the launch of its own Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores. And when it comes to entertainment, it recently made its biggest acquisition ever with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;purchase of film and TV company MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also Amazon Music, and a video games division which Jassy has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division"&gt;previously expressed his support for&lt;/a&gt; despite its &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;rocky history&lt;/a&gt;. And don’t forget those investments in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571091/amazon-pharmacy-store-launch-home-delivery-prescription-medication"&gt;healthcare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683449/amazon-brands-clothing-fashion-trademarks"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyOspY"&gt;Amazon’s size and practices have attracted scrutiny from antitrust regulators around the world. Bezos was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;one of the Big Tech CEOs&lt;/a&gt; asked to testify in front of Congress as part of its antitrust investigation last year. Meanwhile, in Europe, Amazon was recently accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;misusing Marketplace data&lt;/a&gt; as the European Union announced a second antitrust investigation into the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRZVBi"&gt;As the world’s richest man, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bezos won’t be fading into obscurity anytime soon. He’s staying on as Amazon’s executive chair, where he’s said he will “stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives,” and has also said he plans to dedicate more time and energy to other initiatives such as the Day One Fund and Bezos Earth Fund foundations, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;newspaper, and his Blue Origin space company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="921lwL"&gt;In the immediate future, Bezos will fly to the edge of space onboard a rocket built by Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;. The now-former Amazon CEO will be joined by his brother, Mark Bezos, aboard the ship New Shepard’s first crewed mission. But Bezos is currently set to be beaten to space by rival entrepreneur and Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson, who’s due to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;onboard the VSS Unity spaceplane for a test flight on July 11th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Windows 11 app store is already more useful after just a week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcQIieyTigfBdp144JdvNnF4YOY=/186x0:2292x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541870/microsoft_store_windows_11_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Store on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbYhnF"&gt;Microsoft’s dysfunctional app store for Windows, the Microsoft Store, is finally improving under Windows 11. While there’s a UI overhaul and some speed improvements, the key change is allowing more apps into the store. In just the past week alone, some popular apps have started to appear in the Microsoft Store on Windows 11, making it more useful than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EuS3N"&gt;OBS Studio, Zoom, Canva, WinZip, and Adobe Acrobat Reader have all made their way to the Microsoft Store in the past week, alongside Microsoft Edge browser extensions. These early additions, during a beta period for Windows 11, are a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1YJJK"&gt;The Microsoft Store is changing on Windows 11, and eventually Windows 10, to include any traditional desktop apps. Microsoft previously restricted developers to its Universal Windows Apps, before then allowing some desktop apps that were packaged to use its store for updates. Now any app can be part of the store, a move that aligns with the Windows Package Manager Microsoft released last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNdcomXi_a9HPtsWLh3hiRPZtWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22690995/store.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is now part of the Microsoft Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wI01rT"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows Package Manager quickly became better than the Windows store in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21264739/microsoft-windows-package-manager-preview-download"&gt;less than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, offering apps like Zoom and WinRAR that were missing from the main store. The package manager has been growing steadily over the past year, and now includes Discord, Google Chrome, Firefox, and many other popular apps. There’s even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498369/winstall-windows-package-manager-scripts-app-packs"&gt;great third-party web interface&lt;/a&gt; you can use with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQL6zY"&gt;The Microsoft Store is essentially now a frontend for the Windows Package Manager and the WinGet command that’s used to install apps from Microsoft’s repository. That should mean we’ll see even more apps appear in the store in the coming weeks. Mozilla, for example, &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549103#c5"&gt;has hinted&lt;/a&gt; that Firefox will be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDFQgN"&gt;We may even eventually see rival app stores in the Microsoft Store, like Steam or the Epic Games Store. Windows chief Panos Panay said the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550103/microsoft-new-windows-app-store-steam-welcome"&gt;open to having Steam or the Epic Games Store in the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, and it would likely work as a way to link out to apps and games available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rg7HG_6leWoMEzB6v6UGbhqhtI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699670/QFBhodt.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft still has a lot of work to do on the store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ygbVMe"&gt;Part of the new store’s appeal for developers is allowing apps with their own update systems, but also a change by Microsoft to let developers keep 100 percent of the revenue from apps if they use alternative payment platforms. This change &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549222/microsoft-store-developers-windows-11-revenues-games"&gt;doesn’t apply to games&lt;/a&gt;, however. It will take some time until we see just how well Microsoft’s reduced cut of game revenues, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;from 30 to 12 percent starting on August 1st&lt;/a&gt;, will impact the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIEPD0"&gt;While these new app additions are useful, there’s still much work to be done. The store is full of junk apps, with many fake apps, guides, and crapware still showing up in search results. It’s going to take Microsoft some time to clean this part of the store up, particularly because developers have abandoned the Microsoft Store for so long that many of these junk apps are now in the top free apps section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bosird"&gt;Either way, the Microsoft Store is definitely heading in the right direction, after a decade of being largely ignored. If it can get to the point of having every useful and popular app listed, then that’s a great improvement for Windows users who will no longer have to search around the web to find a trusted installer for their favorite apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lynk &amp; Co will make you rethink outdated ideas of car ownership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7wppZsakFyk1FiHcoKJgxMGPiI=/0x170:2040x1530/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541838/verge_IMG_6863_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new day is coming.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Nguyen Tran&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A car that gets cheaper every time you share it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tY9mbf"&gt;“This is not a car, this is different” is how &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;, a company spawned by Volvo and Geely, is positioning the launch of its 01 plug-in hybrid, a compact SUV built from the ground up to share. The more you share its digital key the less you pay each month, possibly even turning a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="q6GadZ"&gt;It’s a bold experiment that I was able to preview in a test vehicle in Amsterdam, where Lynk &amp;amp; Co is staging its first salvo against a century of car ownership mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaPGVX"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co first announced its ambitious approach to car sharing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13328674/lynk-and-co-geely-connected-car-volvo-launch-official"&gt;five years ago&lt;/a&gt; in its home city of Gothenburg, Sweden, emboldened by studies that say cars sit unused 96 percent of the time. That’s valuable real estate that could otherwise be returned to people. So it’s with some anticipation that I set out for my week with a production 01 PHEV running pre-production sharing software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuCoVC2igPYkGd1HMBIWUIsNwUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691478/verge_IMG_8411_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A VW Up from Geenwheels next to the Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 PHEV in Amsterdam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eavED5"&gt;Amsterdam was chosen as Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s launch city for a variety of reasons, chief among them is its multi-modal inhabitants’ intimacy with car-sharing services. My Dutch family, for example, has never owned a car, nor do most of my friends. Instead we use fleet sharing services like Greenwheels, Mywheels, or Share Now. Otherwise we use a personal car-sharing service like Snappcar when looking for &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/auto-huren/auto/delorean-dmc-12/4d2f2479-33f1-49e8-a9ed-d75f5b189934?searchId=795a04f5-f74d-4f70-804f-344c392a0c20&amp;amp;searchSessionId=bc8958c0-e641-4f3c-bcbc-79dc41bf92da"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/auto-huren/auto/ford-%28usa%29-mustang/5a5fac28-92d0-42c3-8775-80e448776d5e?searchId=0af2baf6-0c0e-4770-809d-7405e833353c&amp;amp;searchSessionId=bc8958c0-e641-4f3c-bcbc-79dc41bf92da"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.snappcar.nl/auto-huren/auto/volkswagen-lt/fdf2486a-ddbd-4d0e-911f-370437cd93e5?searchId=696b4b00-a809-49a1-9039-2b908f212912&amp;amp;searchSessionId=bc8958c0-e641-4f3c-bcbc-79dc41bf92da"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; to drive. As much as we love our electric bicycles, a car is often needed when an e-scooter, taxi, bus, or train just won’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM9EsP"&gt;After a week of testing I’ve come away increasingly optimistic about Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s chances, not only to achieve its revenue goals but also its broader societal goal of making people realize that traditional ideas of car ownership, especially in densely populated cities, are woefully outdated. My optimism is fueled by three things: the company’s early success in attracting members, driving the 01 for a few hundred kilometers, and testing an early beta version of the sharing service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVSYN6IPXVmgMOVZWfRQv9KV0wg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691548/verge_DSC_4713_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memberships are off to an aggressive start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qDLDxX"&gt;A PROMISING START&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IhPoxa"&gt;You can buy a Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 outright for €39,000, but most people are opting for &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/month-to-month-details"&gt;memberships that cost €500 each month&lt;/a&gt;. That’s about what you’d pay each month on a &lt;em&gt;four-year&lt;/em&gt; lease for a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.volvocars.com%2Fnl%2Flease-en-financiering%2Fproducten%2Ffinancieren%2Fvolvo-private-lease&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22557411%2Flynk-co-01-cheaper-as-you-share-volvo-geely-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comparable Volvo XC40&lt;/a&gt; which is built upon the same platform as the 01. Only with Lynk &amp;amp; Co you can cancel the agreement at any time. Better yet, you can divide the monthly fee with family and friends, or reduce it further by lending the car out to a general pool of neighbors and tourists at an hourly or daily rate, all of which Lynk &amp;amp; Co will facilitate (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhkuEC"&gt;Membership includes 1,250km (777 miles) of driving per month with each extra kilometer costing €0.15, and unused kilometers carrying over to the next month. The €500/month fee covers insurance, warranty repairs, roadside assistance, and maintenance by Volvo’s dealer network. And because the 01 uses a digital key, Volvo can pick up your car, service it, and return it while you go about your activities. (You get a loaner vehicle if service needs more than a day.) The monthly fee doesn’t cover repairs out of warranty, fuel costs, charging fees, or any costs associated with parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Td41ti"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s manager of press relations, Cecilia Hedlund, tells me that only about 10 percent of paying customers actually buy the car, with the rest signing up for the €500 monthly memberships. So far they’ve attracted almost double the number of paying month-to-month members as expected for all of 2021, and we’re only six months into the year. Of the 9,000 memberships expected, Hedlund says it already has 16,000 members signed up to pay monthly subscriptions for a car, with most residing in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, and Belgium. That number is important because Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s financial success stems from selling memberships, not from the small transaction fees it gets from facilitating each car share. The company is now busy ramping up deliveries with about 300 cars delivered so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTdQHz"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co has sold a non-shareable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/28/16709932/lynk-co-01-suv-release-date-china"&gt;01 model in China since 2017&lt;/a&gt;. The 01 I’ve been testing has been thoroughly updated for Europe, both inside and out, with sharing made possible through the implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/cases/2017/lynkco-cloud-based-solution"&gt;Ericsson’s Connected Vehicle Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXeqepsD9v7P8MQi80Yf0msLSh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691492/verge_DSC_5450_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company has almost double the number of paying members expected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BhZVsC"&gt;THE CAR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AT7PcE"&gt;I’m not a car guy, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/3/9841104/why-own-a-car-when-you-can-share-one-instead"&gt;I am a car &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; guy&lt;/a&gt;, having used a multitude of sharing services since at least 2014. The 01 is far nicer than any of the fleet cars available to share in Amsterdam, though I do wish it was fully electric. (An EV is coming, but not any time soon, I’m told.) The cars from fleet sharing services tend to be exceedingly boring base models like the VW Up! or Citroën C1 that come slathered in external advertising. Every 01 ships without ads and comes &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/car/car-specifications-features"&gt;fully equipped&lt;/a&gt; to restore some dignity to using a shared vehicle. All 01s are the same — the only option for members is the choice of blue or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7Gb43"&gt;Because it’s Volvo, the 01 comes standard with most modern &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/car/car-specifications-features#1a5ec65a-a17d-4fea-951e-05ed65b07d4d;3"&gt;safety features&lt;/a&gt; like adaptive cruise control, emergency braking and forward collision warnings, automatic LED lights and rain sensors, driver alertness control, blind spot detection, a camera for backing up, security alarm, and more. Thankfully, sensors on the front, rear, and sides of the compact SUV enable a semi-autonomous parking feature which is very useful for the tiny parking spots available in dense European cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDH3VX"&gt;It’s also loaded with conveniences like a powered driver seat with memory presets, large panoramic sunroof, powered tailgate, heated seats, automatic AC with zone control, a punchy ten speaker Infinity sound system, and a built-in hands-free voice assistant named Frank (at least on my car).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5n3rt0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10631212"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azMdXH"&gt;The 01 is fitted with two large displays. There’s a 12.7 inch touchscreen display on the center console with support for both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. But the built-in turn-by-turn navigation provided by &lt;a href="https://www.here.com"&gt;Here Technologies&lt;/a&gt; on the 12.3 inch instrument cluster in front of the driver proved superior to both Google and Apple Maps for navigating Dutch roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw68Ep"&gt;To keep your devices charged there’s a wireless charging pad between the driver and front-passenger seats. Otherwise, your devices can be juiced from any of four USB jacks (two front, two rear), or two 12V outlets (front and in the rear cargo area). You can also save on your phone’s data plan when connected to the car’s Wi-Fi hotspot thanks to Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s built-in 4G data. It’s limited to 5GB a month but that can be extended with a call to Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s engagement center under a fair-use policy (borrowers can not use the car’s hotspot). Hell, there’s even an integrated dashcam with 64GB of storage and a second in-car selfie camera for god knows what reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUEGXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seats made from recycled fishing nets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LLp12P"&gt;The interior surfaces look and feel good to the touch, including the eco-friendly textile coverings on the seats made from recycled fishing nets. The Econyl fabric easily withstood my dog’s claws and resisted the grime we tracked in while kitesurfing the muddy shores of Dutch waterways. The seats remained comfortable on chilly mornings and hot afternoons, even against bare thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jJQe9"&gt;And because it’s built to share, the 01 has a number of useful remote monitoring features. For example, I could see the status of the climate control system, if the windows were up, or if a door was left open or unlocked from the comfort of my home. I could even lock or unlock the doors. The Lynk &amp;amp; Co app also informed me of the fuel remaining and charge on the battery, any service warnings, and current location of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYlwmp"&gt;It really was a joy to drive around in something so modern and high-spec after years of drudgery spent inside entry-level automobiles. The 261hp provided by the 01 was thrilling compared to the 60hp we’re used to from fleet sharing vehicles. And the 70km range on battery was enough to reach the beach and back, and for my wife to drive to work where she could easily charge the car from a standard power outlet before her journey home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YN0_-atBjuOjd2YaEeLaP-6GKZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691463/verge_DSC_5507_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A preview of the Lynk &amp;amp; Co app shown here in beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0arqQN"&gt;SHARING&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="s4Hn8C"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s sharing model allows paying members to lend their cars to &lt;a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/sharing/borrow-the-01"&gt;free members&lt;/a&gt; who sign up just to borrow. Signing up isn’t exactly frictionless though, as you have to upload a valid driver’s license and photo, enter payment details, and pass both credit and identity checks. Standard stuff for car-sharing services and traditional rental car companies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmZR5B"&gt;To be successful, car-sharing companies must maintain a magic ratio of vehicles-to-borrowers. Too many vehicles and expenses will outpace revenue. Not enough vehicles and frustrated borrowers will jump to a competitor. In my neighborhood alone, I have four Greenwheels sitting in dedicated city-allocated parking spots within a two-block radius, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhxKf"&gt;It’s hard to imagine Lynk &amp;amp; Co achieving that kind of density anytime soon. In fact, Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s head of car sharing, Adam Broadbent, tells me that the company won’t meet its target ratio of ten borrowers (free members) to every vehicle at launch of the sharing service in Q3. Nevertheless, it knows that most paying members are keen to become lenders in order to bring down their monthly payments and maximize vehicle use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnaZU7"&gt;To compensate for this lack of borrower-to-lender density, later this year, but soon after launch, the company will add a friends and family lending option. Paying members will be able to share digital keys with a small group of trusted people who agree to share the monthly fee. One person, however, will still be on the hook to sign up and pay for the €500/month membership, I’m told. How Lynk &amp;amp; Co will facilitate this to ensure everyone is paying their fair share for usage is still unclear. The beta software I tested didn’t include a friends and family sharing option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fDDfvZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10631204"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PB1DyQ"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co let me preview a beta version of the Lynk &amp;amp; Co app launching in Q3. Sharing is straightforward, allowing lenders (paying members with cars) to set the time, location, price, and conditions of borrowing. Once shared, the car appears on a map showing its availability to free members. Members with cars can also initiate sharing from the car’s display, though I wasn’t able to test that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhXJ5M"&gt;Borrowing a car is as simple as agreeing to the terms set by the lender. Once agreed, a digital key is sent to the borrower which can be used to unlock the car via the Lynk &amp;amp; Co app (using Bluetooth). Lenders and borrowers have star ratings, and cars can be filtered by time and location, and any additional equipment like roof rack, tow hook, or child seat. Importantly, kilometers used by borrowers do not apply to the monthly cap of the lender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzq3po"&gt;The digital key exchange means the borrower and lender never have to meet in person. But Lynk &amp;amp; Co offers lenders some additional protection from creeps by withholding the exact location of the car until 30 minutes before the booking starts, giving the lender time to park the car within the advertised start / end locations, and as far away from their home or business as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUhti5"&gt;I was able to test a lender / borrower scenario using two developer phones (one setup as the lender, the other the borrower) provided by Lynk &amp;amp; Co. In my live test, the borrower phone connected to the lender’s car when I was about five feet (1.5 meters) from it, prompting me to submit a condition report, including five photos taken from around the car at various angles. Only after uploading the photos did the digital key become active on the borrower phone, allowing me to unlock the car. Once inside, the borrower can log into their profile on the center console to download all their preferences. Both the phone and in-car console apps will guide the borrower through the sharing experience, with a countdown timer and reminder to drop-off the lender’s car at the agreed upon time, fuel level, and destination area. I wasn’t able to test these borrower features, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5yjS1"&gt;When the lending period is over, the borrower must again upload five photos to confirm the external condition. Only then can the borrower complete the booking, notifying the lender that the car has been returned. (A booking can be extended by up to two additional hours with approval from the lender.) Lynk &amp;amp; Co checks the fuel level at the start and end of the booking and uses the delta to either add or take money off the final price. The car must also be at least as clean as the borrower found it, otherwise penalties could be incurred. Lynk &amp;amp; Co says it adds a €100 buffer to every reservation to cover costs of booking extensions, late returns, and fuel costs, and will provide lenders with all information needed to challenge any traffic tickets incurred by a borrower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="B1qP5Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sharing can quickly offset that €500/mth membership fee&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ngl4TG"&gt;Lynk &amp;amp; Co’s Broadbent anticipates sharing prices to be around €5 to €10 per hour, and €50 to €100 to borrow it for a day. For comparison, owners of nearby Volvo SUVs on the Snappcar sharing service list their cars for between €65 and €110 per day. If you only need your Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 during the week, for example, you can see how quickly sharing can offset that €500/mth membership fee. Broadbent says that a recommended pricing feature is coming to help members with cars maximize profits when sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B8jci"&gt;Right now there’s no ability for a lender to schedule a car’s availability only on weekends or a set number of days during the week in the beta app I tested, but that’s coming, says Broadbent. I work from home so I could easily share the car Monday through Friday and block it out for my personal use on weekends. In such a scenario, I could even turn a profit once enough borrowers were vying for my car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5YyGw"&gt;Airport sharing is another feature that’s coming. Members with cars can drive to the airport and travelers flying in would get precise directions along with a digital key to use the car while you’re out of town. At the moment, Lynk &amp;amp; Co only accepts category B drivers licenses from a list of 30 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSRJYmSf0oZ13TYMygKyn0Nj-OM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691481/verge_IMG_6969_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes a car is the only mode of transportation that will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tXJPhC"&gt;For what it’s worth, I asked around my own social circle to see who’d be interested in sharing an 01. Two out of four of my friends already using sharing services responded positively with what I’d describe as keen interest, while the other two said it sounded promising but wanted more information. For example, how will friends and family sharing be facilitated, and how will monthly bills be calculated so that fuel / energy costs and usage are all factored in fairly? Understandably, the person who orders a Jack and Coke at the bar doesn’t want to subsidize someone else’s &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/the-real-reason-why-pappy-van-winkle-is-so-expensive"&gt;Pappy Van Winkle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9DxqR"&gt;When I look at my own car-sharing bill for the last year, I see months where I’ve paid over €400 and others that cost me less than €50 (including the gas). It averages out to about €200/mth over the long term. While I’m willing to pay more for a more luxurious car that’s better suited to my active family of five (plus dog), and one that’s shared with a limited trusted group that won’t leave McDonalds bags in the footwells, I also think I’d want to share with at least two other parties to keep costs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="M3MI3e"&gt;“Owning” a Lynk &amp;amp; Co 01 really does have the potential to be different. The fact that I’m actively considering paying €500 a month to become a member says a lot about my experience with the car ahead of its official Q3 sharing launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is getting an ultra-limited release in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixpGO5NDQgFFdSFUavpoihg_A3w=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541768/DSCF7720_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LbPe5P"&gt;Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra is finally going on sale in India in limited quantities. The company had announced its latest flagship smartphone all the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been near-impossible to buy one outside of China ever since. The phone sold out instantly in the UK in May, suggesting very limited stock, and last month Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1400042494792921089"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Indian launch would be delayed “due to circumstances beyond our control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoLQA"&gt;Now, Xiaomi has announced details of how people in India will actually be able to buy one, as long as they’re willing to jump through a few hoops. Customers will need to buy an “ultra gift card” for Rs. 1,999 (~$27) &lt;a href="https://in.event.mi.com/in/mi-11-ultra-register"&gt;on the Mi.com website&lt;/a&gt;, which can later be redeemed against the price of the Mi 11 Ultra and includes some bonuses like two free screen replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0QVgbI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⚡️&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mi11Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Mi11Ultra&lt;/a&gt;⚡️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Register for the first sale by purchasing the ultra gift card, get guaranteed access to sale &amp;amp; other benefits  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  2 Free Screen Replacements&lt;br&gt;  Ultra Merchandise Superfan Box&lt;br&gt;  Times Prime Annual Membership&lt;br&gt;  Extra F-code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Know more: &lt;a href="https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d"&gt;https://t.co/GGbHaZvU2d&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/61x4jYCREP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/61x4jYCREP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mi India (@XiaomiIndia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1411280371396669440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="18WscM"&gt;The Mi 11 Ultra itself starts at Rs. 69,999 (~$940) in India. Xiaomi hasn’t said how long the gift cards will be available for, how many phones it’ll make available for purchase, or when they’ll ship, but it’s describing the release as a “limited-quantity sale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3ELbM"&gt;Xiaomi’s key selling point for the Mi 11 Ultra over its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;very good&lt;/a&gt;) non-ultra sibling is an all-new camera system. The main camera has a large 1/1.12-inch 50-megapixel sensor, and there are also 48-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto modules. All of this is housed in a gigantic camera bump complete with a secondary OLED screen that can serve as a viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eco7pE"&gt;I’ve been using the Mi 11 Ultra for a while now — stay tuned for our review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Many Saints of Newark, Foundation, Beckett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6F3nE015CItdqc1LFXCKEa6d2c=/169x0:1338x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69541060/michael_gandolfini.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Michael Gandolfini stars as Tony Soprano in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFfeGRbWLQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7EQHx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let’s say “unconventional” judge, and it’s as if my favorite character from &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what’s going to happen on the next episode of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can’t imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2awLf"&gt;This week we finally get a first look at the prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and a new look at the new&lt;em&gt; Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0roKoN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAFfeGRbWLQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qOwkcG"&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PySsLR"&gt;In this prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano, the iconic role that won his father James multiple awards. Michael is a young Tony in what &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/many-saints-of-newark-trailer-sopranos-movie-alan-taylor"&gt;director Alan Taylor&lt;/a&gt; says is the story of Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola)— father of &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;’ Christopher— the man who made Tony into who he became. We get a glimpse of Vera Farmiga as Livia, who looks like she plays the matriarch as ice cold as the late, great Nancy Marchand did. Leslie Odom Jr., Jon Bernthal, Corey Stoll, and Ray Liotta also star in &lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max October 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w4sDcb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPT_PNucTWE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="olT7eW"&gt;Beckett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfA1V"&gt;An American tourist vacationing in Greece gets into a car accident, and when he wakes up, he’s embroiled in a conspiracy and people are shooting at him. Mr. Beckett does not appear to have the same skill set as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKaB5dvQ4g&amp;amp;ab_channel=MovieclipsClassicTrailers"&gt;Jason Bourne&lt;/a&gt;, however, which will probably make things a bit more difficult as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on and attempts to get to the US Embassy. John David Washington and Alicia Vikander star in &lt;em&gt;Beckett,&lt;/em&gt; which hits Netflix August 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pKjod3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOAA1U0li8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ncYdoF"&gt;Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1KMEPh"&gt;The second teaser trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; finally gives us a release date for this long-awaited series based on the Isaac Asimov novels. The downfall of the Galactic Empire has been predicted by Hari Seldon (Jared Harris), so it has to build a foundation to preserve mankind’s knowledge. Along with Harris, Lee Pace stars as Brother Day, and Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick. &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres September 24th on Apple TV Plus, with new episodes every Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lplJZ7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KEjKlH"&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="umjdTq"&gt;We got a teaser of the Kevin Smith revival of He-Man’s adventures in June, and now we get the full trailer. It’s not a retelling of the He-Man story, but rather picks up where the original TV show concluded in 1985. Chris Wood, Mark Hamill, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lena Headley, and Mark Hamill (as Skeletor) voice characters in &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe,&lt;/em&gt; which debuts on Netflix July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uUUatE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BSSoD73TSk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fao446"&gt;Jolt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9jN8Qt"&gt;This trailer has Kate Beckinsale kicking things and beating people up but she isn’t a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKHL5PyAPzs&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonyPicturesEntertainment"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;; instead she has a rare disorder that makes her rage out if she doesn’t get regular shock treatments from Stanley Tucci. Naturally she meets a guy who doesn’t freak out at her shocking condition (sorry) and of course he gets killed and the cops think she did it so then she has to do some revenge-kicking. Bobby Cannavale, Jai Courtney, Laverne Cox, and Susan Sarandon also star in &lt;em&gt;Jolt&lt;/em&gt; which comes to Amazon Prime Video July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apex Legends hackers interrupt games with messages about Titanfall hacking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="‘Apex Legends’ - Skulltown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-KQcVCcR-XEFqgQYe9GR7eRElg=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69540942/apex_screenshot_world_skulltown.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;‘Apex Legends’ | Respawn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Afq8Ds"&gt;Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale shooter &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; has proven to be a hit, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382560/apex-legends-100-million-players-respawn-ea"&gt;over 100 million unique players&lt;/a&gt;, and counted over 300,000 people playing on Steam &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RKRigney/status/1389947124419375111"&gt;at one time in May&lt;/a&gt;. But an issue bubbling over from its earlier &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; games is now having an impact on &lt;em&gt;Apex&lt;/em&gt;, as reports across social media show players running into messages from people hacking the game with a “Save Titanfall” message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2YmS8"&gt;Respawn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411777384294977536"&gt;acknowledged the issues on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, saying “We are aware of and actively investigating issues impacting @PlayApex playlists that are preventing players from getting into matches.” In a follow-up tweet at 7PM, the developer said these attacks don’t put the personal information of players at risk, and that the team is testing a fix. As of 10:15PM, the developer appeared confident that problems for Apex Legends are resolved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="spx52n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re testing a fix now and will update when we have more confidence. Additional updates may be required. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, we’ve determined that this attack—while disruptive—has not put players’ personal information or accounts at risk. More updates to come as we make progress.&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411822173132627977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="y3EjMA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve confirmed that matchmaking has been restored. We’re keeping an eye on things but believe the issue to be resolved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your patience, Legends.&lt;/p&gt;— Respawn (@Respawn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1411871551213944837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7yiYyh"&gt;The issue went on for hours, and when players were affected, they couldn’t queue for new games. All of this happened at the same time that &lt;em&gt;Apex &lt;/em&gt;is hosting a special event drawing players back to the original versions of its first two maps (including divisive areas like Skulltown, pictured above). As &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-hackers-fill-game-with-messages-complainin-1847228032"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report, the messages have been appearing for players on PC, Xbox One and PS4. I joined a game on PC and when the match was over, I was greeted with the following message pointing to a “Save Titanfall” website. After Respawn indicated the problems were over, I managed to play a few matches without any odd messages or matchmaking problems beyond the usual ones, like not getting paired with enough/any teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5haWtbeOg2ySzfZmsSEJtnqo2yA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699225/SAVETITANFALL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yqoaaE"&gt;It appears that whoever is behind this attack is doing it because of similar issues that have affected the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall &lt;/em&gt;games going back years. A problem attributed to a single person kicked players out of&lt;em&gt; Titanfall 1&lt;/em&gt; sessions on PC and inundated them with racist messages, making the multiplayer-only title largely unplayable, in an issue &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/titanfall/titanfall-hackers"&gt;dating back to 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3SPxb"&gt;In recent months Respawn has tweeted that “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1379204515748929538"&gt;help is coming ASAP&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1395446711682838530"&gt;the team is investigating&lt;/a&gt;” problems like DDOS attacks on the &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; series, but the issues continue. With hacking becoming a game-stopping problem for a franchise that EA is counting on to provide over $750 million in net bookings during its 2022 financial year, solutions can’t wait much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6L--dHuUbfXRldeiadfgIhLMUm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22699226/apex_net_bookings_2021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BLikts"&gt;Apex Legends is one of the most successful games in the market today. We now have more than 100 million unique players in the game on console and PC, with player engagement growing globally at incredible levels throughout the last year — and we are forecasting continued growth...We are forecasting close to 20% year-over-year growth to $750 million in net bookings for Apex Legends in FY22, with significant potential for upside this year and beyond as we launch the mobile game. — &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2021/Q4/Q4-FY21-Transcript.pdf"&gt;Andrew Wilson, EA CEO&lt;/a&gt; (PDF)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="sox25J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Players affected by the hack are unable to queue for any other game mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The website accuses EA of "fraud" for selling Titanfall while it's "unplayable."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Clip via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YungLucianOG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YungLucianOG&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://t.co/4MqZi2UBh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4MqZi2UBh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apex Legends News (@alphaINTEL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alphaINTEL/status/1411660433786904576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tnkjZB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 4th, 7:38PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added 7PM update from Respawn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIl6uQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 4th, 10:38PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added note from Respawn that the issues appear to be resolved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
