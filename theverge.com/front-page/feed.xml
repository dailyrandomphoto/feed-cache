    <title>Netflix has created a TikTok clone that lets people scroll through funny clips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-L6M6C0wZPPdQXe6jtJ_Y3pTa5A=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904062/FAST_LAUGHS_PHONE_COMP_in_Jerry_v1__0_00_00_13_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8d0U3"&gt;Netflix is launching a new mobile feature that gives subscribers the opportunity to get their fill of laughs in for the night without having to watch a whole TV show or movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej1yBK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/fast-laughs-is-here"&gt;Fast Laughs&lt;/a&gt;, currently only available for iOS device owners in select countries, looks and feels like TikTok or Instagram Reels. Different short clips — taken from shows like &lt;em&gt;Big Mouth &lt;/em&gt;or stand-up specials from comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Ali Wong — play directly within the Netflix app. If one of the shows, films, or specials sparks interest, people can add said title to their saved list to watch later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnibdL"&gt;“We’re always looking for new ways to entertain and make discovery easier for members,” &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Patrick Flemming, director of product innovation at Netflix, said, adding that Fast Laughs is a “new full-screen feed of funny clips from a wide variety of Netflix titles, ranging from films and series to our deep bench of stand-up specials.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R1sbB7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XqS1TPyQVbo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="15EuP4"&gt;Adding Fast Laughs makes sense for Netflix, considering the growth and prominence of TikTok in the market right now. Netflix’s last few earnings reports have specifically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;referenced TikTok as a major competitor&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not that Netflix and TikTok make the same type of content, but people are spending more time on TikTok — and therefore less time on Netflix. Giving iPhone users something else to scroll through on their phones, and turning that into more time spent on the app by convincing people to make their way through &lt;em&gt;Big Mouth &lt;/em&gt;again, is a smart business move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKhSYg"&gt;It also helps Netflix highlight just how much content is on the platform. Netflix has invested heavily in stand-up comedy, &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/01/kevin-hart-netflix-deal.html"&gt;struck multipicture deals&lt;/a&gt; with comedians like Adam Sandler and Kevin Hart, and is building up its slate of animation. Since there’s so much content, a lot of it can get lost on the platform. This is one way to give subscribers a tiny glimpse of things they may have missed. That’s the key difference between TikTok and Netflix’s Fast Laughs: Netflix isn’t trying to launch a new platform to provide entertainment, but instead use a new feature to keep people on its current platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuTRmE"&gt;To access Fast Laughs, customers can use the bottom navigation menu to click on the Fast Laughs tab. The company will start testing Fast Laughs on Android devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Project Gucciberg offers classic audiobooks read by an AI deepfake of Gucci Mane</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI4bq-LxCYRp7NxqKYSf9FIVoUU=/58x0:1456x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903995/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_3.23.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Project Gucciberg: AI’ced up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AVFiCB"&gt;Ever wanted to have Leo Tolstoy’s &lt;em&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/em&gt; or Franz Kafka’s &lt;em&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/em&gt; read to you by trap god Gucci Mane, creator of such hits as “Lemonade” and “Wasted”? Well, a) that’s an awfully specific desire, and b) it’s your lucky day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YwiaK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://projectgucciberg.mschfmag.com/"&gt;Project Gucciberg&lt;/a&gt; is the latest drop from viral factory MSCHF, and it does exactly that. Using machine learning, MSCHF created an audio deepfake of Gucci Mane reading a selection of classic texts from &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt;. They’re all free to listen to and come with book covers that blend in perfectly with the artwork of Gucci Mane’s prolific discography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LL1JyZ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; of Project Gucciberg is luridly straightforward, but the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is harder to answer. If you’re not familiar with MSCHF, I recommend our profile of the outfit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;from last year&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, they’re a group of VC-funded creators who make weird things designed to go viral online, like squeaky chicken bongs and Air Max 97 sneakers filled with water from the River Jordan, some of which are sold for a nominal fee. Then they ??? and profit (presumably by selling their services to companies who want things &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; made to go viral online). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2juBwl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Gucci’s pronunciation follows a very particular cadence”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="72eMqh"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;MSCHF’s Dan Greenberg didn’t go into the motivation behind Project Gucciberg but was more than happy to talk about the mechanics. Audio deepfakes are now pretty common (listen to this clone of Joe Rogan for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa"&gt;good example&lt;/a&gt;), to the point where they’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21339898/deepfake-audio-voice-clone-scam-attempt-nisos"&gt;used to commit fraud&lt;/a&gt;. To make one, you just need a lot of sample data of your target speaking and the right neural networks to learn and copy their mannerisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1JWlM"&gt;Greenberg says MSCHF collected around six hours of audio of Gucci Mane talking from podcasts, interviews, and the like. They then created transcriptions of the clips to help with the text-to-speech (TTS) process. This required creating a “Gucci pronunciation key/dictionary to better capture the idiosyncrasies of Gucci Mane’s particular argot.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFhuR8hrgOrFW2BVwIgBzhTS7A0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342344/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_3.24.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned book covers of Project Gucciberg are a delight to behold. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek5Ps6"&gt;“Gucci’s pronunciation follows a very particular cadence — he uses a much greater variety of vowel sounds, for instance, than your average TTS reader would,” says Greenberg. “The dictionary breaks words up into phonemes (discrete vocal gestures) that our model then uses as building blocks ... So for a simple example, we need our model to know what syllables to elide, or flow into each other across words: it needs to know to say “talm ‘bout” not ‘talking about,’ and the Gucci dictionary { T AH1 L M B AW1 T } gets us there where the written words ‘talking about’ do not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAS8Lx"&gt;The results are impressive: the deepfake certainly sounds like the man himself, though the results are not always totally coherent or of the greatest quality. “Our fake Gucci Mane often sounds like he’s speaking through a bad mic, or over a low-quality internet stream, and part of this is because in the training data he often is doing exactly that,” says Greenberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLrRsC"&gt;Exactly why Gucci was chosen for this project came down to two factors, says Greenberg: one, the rapper has a distinctive voice, and two, the Project Gucciberg pun was &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/"&gt;too delicious&lt;/a&gt; to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ccysC6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The law has yet to offer an opinion on the legality of creating audio deepfakes of Gucci Mane&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ueeILN"&gt;Greenberg adds that MSCHF didn’t approach Gucci to ask for permission to use his voice. As a disclaimer on the site slyly points out, the whole project raises interesting questions about copyright in the age of AI fakes. ”We didn’t write the books, and we deepfaked the voice,” it says. “Is this copyright infringement? Is it identity theft? All of the training data (recordings) used to make Project Gucciberg were publicly available on the web. Gucciberg lives in that lovely grey area where everything’s new and anything goes.” It certainly is! &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has attempted to reach out to Gucci Mane via his record label for a response, and we’ll update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8Dq6o"&gt;Is Project Gucciberg anything more than a quick click and a lol? Well, not really. But that’s MSCHF’s business, and they’re very good at it. While listening to more than a few minutes of the resulting audio is a little disorientating, Greenberg suggests there may be unique benefits to the coming world of on-demand deepfake celebrity audiobooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9k14b"&gt;“Every once in a while ... the extreme casualness of Gucci Mane’s narration really does put the text in a new light,” he says, speaking about the benefits of listening to the deepfake version of Kafka’s &lt;em&gt;Metamorphosis&lt;/em&gt;. “Gregor Samsa really comes across as just another guy who doesn’t want to get out of bed, you know?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam sensation Valheim sold 5 million copies in one month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3PWRW0eOMTugyzQMBG1-BaKQhaA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903652/screenshot_ygg2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Iron Gate Studio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KF2SBF"&gt;Breakout early access sensation &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, the Nordic-themed survival title &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;taking the gaming world by storm&lt;/a&gt;, has sold more than 5 million copies since it launched on Steam on February 2nd, developer Iron Gate Studio announced on Wednesday. At a retail price of $19.99, that’s roughly $100 million in revenue before accounting for Valve’s cut and other expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQRjfN"&gt;The Swedish studio developed the game &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valheim-how-a-5-person-team-created-the-most-popular-game-on-steam"&gt;with a team of just five people&lt;/a&gt; and released it on Steam’s Early Access platform in February, where it’s battled its way to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295589/valheim-peak-player-record-steam-terraria-fallout-among-us"&gt;top five most played games on the entire platform&lt;/a&gt; with more than 500,000 concurrent players at one point last month. (It’s &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;currently sitting at No. 4&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam charts, behind only &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouB7i5"&gt;The closest analog to &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s success is &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, which holds the record of highest concurrent player count on Steam at more than 3.2 million. Like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, which arguably pushed the battle royale genre into the mainstream with its then-unprecedented 100-player take on competitive survival shooters, &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;is combining the crafting and survival sim mechanics from popular games like &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rust &lt;/em&gt;and giving them new life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvotQP"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; continues to attract critical and player acclaim, with over 115,000 positive user reviews on Steam,” Iron Gate and its publisher, Coffee Stain Publishing, write in a press release. “It has also been climbing the ranks of the 250 top reviewed games of all time on the platform, now sitting at number 39. On Twitch, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; has maintained a steady stream of viewers, and fans have now spent more than 35M hours watching &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; gameplay, and over 16,266 years playing.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD announces $479 Radeon RX 6700 XT, says it will have ‘significantly more GPUs available’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VaLOsppB0KkY_9XRPWzASo5GiW0=/100x0:1500x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903632/amd_6700_xt_render.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P2SjUv"&gt;AMD has heard you loud and clear: you can’t buy its excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; graphics cards at anything close to their retail prices. Today, the company’s announcing a new GPU that might (but probably won’t?) change that: the Radeon RX 6700 XT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZMH7X"&gt;“With the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT launch, we are on track to have significantly more GPUs available for sale at launch,” AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Even better: AMD claims it’ll begin refreshing stock of RX 6000 GPUs and Ryzen 5000 CPUs every week &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/direct-buy/"&gt;on its own website&lt;/a&gt;, where it’ll sell them at their retail prices. We’ve been waiting for that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;for nearly two months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwvwNK"&gt;The new RX 6700 XT will arrive on March 18th for a suggested retail price of $479. In a normal, sane year, that would slot it between Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;$500 RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt;, which we called “the 1440p sweet spot,” and Nvidia’s bang-for-the-buck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;$400 RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;, where you might have to dial down the settings here and there. It’s also a full $100 less than AMD’s $579 RX 6800, which we found had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;enough oomph for entry-level 4K gaming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s48Wsz"&gt;This isn’t a sane period for GPU buyers, though. In December, the actual street prices of the $400 3060 Ti, the $500 3070, and the $579 RX 6800 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;were $675, $819, and $841, respectively&lt;/a&gt; — and that was &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; Trump’s tariffs pushed Nvidia and AMD’s board partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;to raise their retail prices&lt;/a&gt;. “We know it’s crazy out there, we’re doing everything we can,” says AMD’s Nish Neelalojanan, a director of product management. That not only includes more stock at AMD.com but also additional supply for board partners and manufacturers that’ll sell gaming PCs later on. AMD wouldn’t say how much of that stock is being allocated toward GPUs that’ll be sold at AMD.com, though. It says it doesn’t set its partners’ retail prices either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSUHzUPijsuZ0E1FzJqhmQvIg9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342449/amd_6700_xt_render_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6vqHgL"&gt;Assuming for a moment that AMD pulls it off, managing substantially greater availability &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;than Nvidia’s recent debut&lt;/a&gt;, the RX 6700 XT sounds like it could be a compelling pick. With 230 watts of power, 12GB of video memory, and 40 compute units (compared to 60 for the RX 6800 and 80 for the RX 6800 XT), AMD’s promising you’ll be able to play all of the latest games at maximum settings at 1440p resolution. With a fast enough CPU, AMD suggests you should be able to hit 212 fps in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, 272 fps in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and 360 fps in &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six Siege&lt;/em&gt;, enough for esports gamers to justify some of the fastest monitors on the market. AMD says it should be fast enough for ray tracing at 1440p as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zF1wjGMgqlStmwqg15VuB7kxo30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342451/amd_1440p_bench_6700_xt.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CF7Qix"&gt;The company’s early benchmarks (see above) show it pulling ahead of Nvidia’s 3070 and 3060 Ti, though not in all games. It’s worth noting these numbers were generated using the frame rate boost of AMD’s Smart Access Memory (generically known as Resizable BAR), something that’s only just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302679/nvidia-rtx-3060-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus"&gt;starting to roll out to Nvidia’s graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; and generally requires newer CPUs to work. That said, AMD also just announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310745/amd-ryzen-3000-smart-access-memory-resizable-bar"&gt;it will begin rolling out Resizable BAR to its Ryzen 3000-series processors&lt;/a&gt;, not just the newer Ryzen 5000 ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRZHcD"&gt;The new card will require two power connectors, an 8-pin and a 6-pin, and the GPU should be clocked somewhat faster than in earlier RX 6000-series cards at up to 2424MHz. It’s got a 192-bit memory bus, down from 256-bit for the company’s other 6000-series cards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1N_nd4yAVbO5kZoI5uU2rShRgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342489/3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OCRVqm"&gt;Clearly, we’ll have to test the RX 6700 XT’s performance ourselves, but nothing matters more than availability — and where that availability will leave the card’s actual price by the time you can buy one. AMD claims cards will be available on March 18th from all of the usual board partners, 40 different system builders, and AMD.com, with prebuilt systems including the HP Omen 25L and 30L desktops coming later this spring and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZGZ6A"&gt;While AMD’s own version is a dual-fan card with the same basic reference design as the RX 6800 and 6800 XT, it appears many of AMD’s partners are opting for three-fan designs. Those generally carry a premium price as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UJI8C"&gt;And in case you’re wondering, AMD has no plans to nerf the crypto mining performance of the RX 6700 XT the way Nvidia did for Ethereum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;with the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;. “We have no plans to limit the product in that way,” AMD told journalists this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovuT9j"&gt;You can watch the company’s 20-minute presentation, including a tease of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing, in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD is bringing Smart Access Memory’s frame rate boosts to Ryzen 3000 processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4jv78usm_TtIkzcLbO31RbKLA-4=/401x0:4720x2879/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903568/AMD_Ryzen_5000_Series_Lidded_5.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKjujS"&gt;The bar has just been lowered (in a good way!) for Resizable BAR, the PCI-Express graphics feature that lets CPUs directly access a GPU’s onboard memory to improve gaming frame rates. That’s because AMD just announced it’s bringing the tech to its last-gen Ryzen 3000 series processors, not just the new Ryzen 5000 chips that initially launched with the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRQm3d"&gt;AMD originally debuted the feature as “AMD Smart Access Memory,” and you specifically needed an AMD Ryzen 5000 CPU and an AMD Radeon RX 6000 graphics card to make it work. That wasn’t a particularly easy sell, considering both have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;incredibly hard to find&lt;/a&gt; at retail since they first debuted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQvjHX"&gt;But it &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;an easy sell for Nvidia and Intel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226560/nvidia-resizable-bar-support-intel-amd-smart-access-memory-feature"&gt;which announced in January that they’d be adopting Resizable BAR&lt;/a&gt; with initial support for Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series laptop GPUs, and later rolling out to RTX 3000-series desktops when paired with both AMD and a selection of both 11th Gen and 10th Gen Intel CPUs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302679/nvidia-rtx-3060-resizable-bar-support-30-series-gpus"&gt;Nvidia just launched support for the new RTX 3060 desktop graphics card last week&lt;/a&gt;, with its other new GPUs coming in late March (though you’ll need a motherboard update, too).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QB39jF2p2lvq2Gb2tk_QO5SjV_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342442/amd_smart_access_memory_ryzen_3000.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pFOxuZ"&gt;With Ryzen 3000, AMD’s actually promising up to 16 percent more performance, compared to the 10 percent both AMD and Nvidia previously offered, though it will really depend on the game. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2178-amd-smart-access-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechSpot&lt;/em&gt; discovered&lt;/a&gt; that some games could see a 20 percent boost on the AMD CPU+AMD GPU side of things, while other games actually had reduced performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCbJ2"&gt;Because of the possible downsides, Nvidia decided to only turn it on for certain games where there’s a benefit, with the first wave including &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Battlefield V, Borderlands 3, Forza Horizon 4, Gears 5, Metro Exodus, Red Dead Redemption 2, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRb723"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FedEx will spend $2 billion to become carbon neutral by 2040</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XgC1tkM31zCbTdLjekw9cRnLHGk=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903401/Sustainability_Image_small.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1WpkXr"&gt;FedEx will spend $2 billion in “initial investments” to become carbon neutral by 2040, the company &lt;a href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/sustainability2021/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The move comes as many of the world’s biggest automakers are also pledging to phase out carbon-emitting vehicles within the next several decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTSeMI"&gt;FedEx claims it is the largest cargo airline in the world, with more than 650 aircraft in operation. As such, it has a particularly large carbon footprint, making its pledge to go completely carbon neutral a uniquely massive challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MoFN9x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The money will be spent in three key areas&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnh5I2"&gt;The money will be spent in three key areas: vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration. FedEx will also donate $100 million to Yale University’s efforts to devise new ways to achieve carbon sequestration, which is the process of capturing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere. The company said that, initially, it will fund research to help “offset greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to current airline emissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiq3n5"&gt;But most of the funds will be spent on buying new electric delivery vehicles to replace FedEx’s largely gas-powered fleet. The phase-out will take place over the next several years, with the goal set for 50 percent of FedEx Express pickup and delivery vehicle purchases to be electric by 2025. By 2030, 100 percent of those vehicle purchases will be electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfFrVI"&gt;But the real challenge will be to eliminate the carbon output of FedEx’s air operation. While UPS is known for its ground delivery service, FedEx is mostly recognized for its global air express freight. And while there has been a lot of progress in rolling out new electric ground delivery vehicles, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/14/17686706/electric-airplane-flying-car-battery-weight-green-energy-travel"&gt;process for eliminating emissions from the aviation industry&lt;/a&gt; has been much slower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T6Ujc5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electrifying ground vehicles is simple compared to building a fleet of non-polluting airplanes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0rVNTs"&gt;That’s probably why FedEx’s goal of becoming completely carbon neutral is so far off in the future. Global automakers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and others have set similar deadlines within the next decade. But electrifying ground vehicles is simple compared to building a fleet of non-polluting airplanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beZioD"&gt;FedEx currently operates 118 all-electric trucks and 364 commercial hybrid trucks, the company says. That is a tiny fraction of the overall 43,000 motor vehicles the company has in operation currently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAKeNa"&gt;The company says it will also seek to eliminate the carbon produced by its packaging and shipping facilities. This can be achieved through “carbon–neutral shipping offerings and sustainable packaging solutions,” as well as investments in renewable energy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaEvHk"&gt;Notably, FedEx did not say it would purchase carbon offsets as a way to achieve full neutrality, though its investment in Yale University’s research project could be seen as such. Purchasing offsets has become a standard way for car companies and other businesses to write off their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy or conservation projects aimed at bolstering forests’ ability to naturally store carbon. But there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;offsets haven’t succeeded&lt;/a&gt; in slowing global warming and have instead given companies license to keep polluting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaLEhl"&gt;FedEx, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the latest giant corporation to make a specific pledge to go carbon neutral. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169798/united-airlines-emissions-carbon-capture-climate-change-goal"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137782/delta-carbon-neutral-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-airlines"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-climatechange/uber-jetblue-join-amazon-backed-climate-pledge-idUSKBN28C24H"&gt;JetBlue&lt;/a&gt; said they would eliminate all of their emissions over the next several decades. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294040/lyft-electric-vehicle-ev-100-percent-2030"&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt; have pledged to go carbon neutral within a similar timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4nuUZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Game Pass aims for sports fans with NBA 2K21, Madden NFL 21, NHL 21, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KTFzsjO6SPQRvh8auNXiOpiTggM=/0x0:1296x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903351/TW_Available_Today_Coming_Soon_templates_3.3.2021_6_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mq96ST"&gt;Microsoft is adding four sports games to Xbox Game Pass in March and April. &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/03/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-march-wave-1-2021/"&gt;arrives today&lt;/a&gt; as part of EA Play for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and &lt;em&gt;Football Manager 2021&lt;/em&gt; will arrive tomorrow for both Xbox consoles and PC. &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K1&lt;/em&gt; will also launch on Xbox Game Pass tomorrow and will be available on xCloud game streaming, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAED9y"&gt;The fourth and final sports addition will be &lt;em&gt;NHL 21&lt;/em&gt; in April, arriving for Xbox console owners with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Sports games aren’t the only new additions this month, though. &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; is coming in March for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1h0E44"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Game Pass briefly explained: console, PC, xCloud streaming and more ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6IgXi2"&gt;Microsoft offers three different versions of Xbox Game Pass, and each will provide different levels of access to games. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the highest tier at $14.99 per month, offering access to EA Play games and xCloud game streaming. Xbox Game Pass itself is $9.99 per month, and the PC version is also $9.99 per month. We’ve got a full and detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437529/xbox-game-pass-versions-tier-ultimate-pc-console-explainer"&gt;breakdown of all the differences right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTHmFD"&gt;As always, there are some games leaving Xbox Game Pass this month. The following will disappear on March 15th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LTlLwS"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Alvastia Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; (console and PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yEMc6G"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Astrologaster &lt;/em&gt;(PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aVfuwt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&lt;/em&gt; (console and PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g63ZD4"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Kona &lt;/em&gt;(console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YlNw7z"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt; (console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T promised a TV revolution — instead, we got a giant mess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQpu1rRUe2zP1hR9GfGXyQsv1ns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68903343/acastro_180613_1777_at_t_timewarner_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Th5FFb"&gt;Last week, AT&amp;amp;T announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301840/att-tpg-directv-tv-uverse-new-company-announced"&gt;it would be spinning off its TV business&lt;/a&gt; — including DirecTV, AT&amp;amp;T TV, and U-verse — in a deal it claimed would greatly benefit the company’s customers, employees, and shareholders. The deal provides AT&amp;amp;T with a $7.8 billion cash infusion to pay down debt and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;recent wireless spectrum purchases&lt;/a&gt;, and a 70 percent stake in the “new” DirecTV. But it also values the entire operation at around $16.25 billion, a massive loss from the $67 billion AT&amp;amp;T paid just a few years earlier for just DirecTV alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boc8Qv"&gt;“It’s fair to say that some aspects of the transaction have not played out as we had planned,” AT&amp;amp;T said of the deal, trying to put a good face on a more than $50 billion loss, “such as pay TV households in the US declining at a faster pace across the industry than anticipated when we announced the deal back in 2014.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PX1EfR"&gt;It’s the latest chapter in AT&amp;amp;T’s long journey to transform from a boring old telecom into a dominant player in new media. Six years, 54,858 layoffs, two mergers, and nearly $175 billion later, AT&amp;amp;T is only marginally closer to streaming TV dominance. Instead, customers and employees are footing the bill for their bad decisions in the form of TV rate hikes and layoffs that show no sign of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EwnpyX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the worst acquisitions of all time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DQitpu"&gt;Wall Street telecom analyst Craig Moffett surveyed the wreckage in a research note to investors, in which he noted the deal does little to tackle $157 billion in remaining AT&amp;amp;T debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLHBiF"&gt;“AT&amp;amp;T’s DirecTV is inarguably one of the worst acquisitions of all time,” Moffett said. “They bought it for $67 billion in 2013. Even at the overly-generous valuation reported last night, they are exiting at a price 76% below what they paid for it just seven years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Shvx09"&gt;It wasn’t supposed to be this way. AT&amp;amp;T executives once dreamed of creating an online video juggernaut that could rival the power of Google and Facebook in the online advertising space, using must-watch HBO content — and AT&amp;amp;T’s wireless network — as the glue holding the effort together. That dream fueled the &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_to_acquire_directv.html"&gt;DirecTV acquisition in 2014&lt;/a&gt; (which executives promised would deliver “enhanced innovation” and “significant benefits for consumers”) as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17468612/att-time-warner-acquisition-court-decision"&gt;the Time Warner acquisition in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_to_acquire_time_warner.html"&gt;we were told&lt;/a&gt; would usher forth the “next wave of innovation in converging media and communications”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UNuQK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;54,858 employees laid off since 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyRs8k"&gt;But for AT&amp;amp;T, a company built on the back of the far &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;less competitive and innovative US broadband sector&lt;/a&gt;, that dream proved hard to realize. First, AT&amp;amp;T unveiled so many discordant TV brands across both its traditional cable and streaming platforms, even &lt;a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/att-is-confusing-att-tv-with-att-tv-now-creating-mass-confusion/"&gt;the company’s own employees got confused&lt;/a&gt;. The company then attempted to dig out from under its massive merger debt load by imposing &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/11/att-raises-directv-prices-again-amid-customer-losses-and-possible-sale/#:~:text=AT%26T%20has%20announced%20another%20round,a%20notice%20on%20its%20website."&gt;repeated price increases&lt;/a&gt; on subscribers already tired from years of relentless rate hikes. A discounted $15-per-month streaming TV offering, used to &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/media/att-watch-streaming-service/index.html"&gt;lure regulators into approving the Time Warner merger&lt;/a&gt;, quickly &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90521422/att-is-killing-its-cheap-tv-bundle-for-cord-cutters"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt; as soon as the merger ink had dried. AT&amp;amp;T’s customers, paying an average of &lt;a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2020/q3-2020/3Q20_Trending_Schedule.pdf"&gt;$130.55&lt;/a&gt; per month for television, quickly revolted. As a result, AT&amp;amp;T has lost 8 million pay TV subscribers in just the last four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bgdrb"&gt;But the casualties from AT&amp;amp;T’s merger go well beyond the financial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUp0WI"&gt;As streaming shifted from pesky upstart to the mainstream, younger consumers began viewing traditional satellite television as an antiquated relic of a bygone era. As a result, companies like Dish Network and DirecTV were &lt;a href="https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/major-pay-tv-providers-lost-about-1570000-subscribers-in-2q-2020/"&gt;particularly hard hit&lt;/a&gt; by the cord-cutting revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jejPir"&gt;Yet, in 2017, company executives made repeated television appearances promising that if the Trump administration passed its tax relief plan, the company would respond with billions in investment and thousands of “&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/04/att-ceo-says-a-corporate-tax-cut-would-mean-thousands-more-jobs-for-hard-hat-workers.html"&gt;high-paying, really good jobs with great benefits&lt;/a&gt;.” Similar promises were made by both AT&amp;amp;T and &lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/cwa-fighting-maintain-good-jobs-in-att-time-warner-merger"&gt;unions&lt;/a&gt; ahead of each merger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOmVkY"&gt;After receiving an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-t-got-a-giant-tax-cut-but-has-laid-off-thousands-union-says/"&gt;$42 billion&lt;/a&gt; in tax cuts from the Trump administration, the company has instead laid off an estimated &lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/instead-of-cutting-jobs-att-must-lead-recovery"&gt;54,858 employees since 2017&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T imposed additional layoffs at Time Warner properties, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/08/dc-comics-dc-universe-hit-layoffs-warnermedia-1203009714/"&gt;including HBO and DC&lt;/a&gt;, and shuttered businesses like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18701446/dc-comics-vertigo-shutting-down-reorganization-dc-kids-black-label"&gt;DC’s popular Vertigo label&lt;/a&gt; in a desperate bid to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dg36aa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A sprawling collection of businesses battling well-funded competitors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcfCnf"&gt;Elsewhere, AT&amp;amp;T remained under steady fire for failing to upgrade its aging DSL lines to fiber, a problem particularly pronounced in &lt;a href="https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2019/08/06/atts-digital-redlining-of-dallas-new-research-by-dr-brian-whitacre/"&gt;marginalized neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;. Attention and resources that may have helped address the country’s stubborn digital divide were instead funneled into an aggressive proposal designed largely to appease shareholders, consumer groups say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldgkSo"&gt;“[Former AT&amp;amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson] was getting a ton of pressure to generate cash flow to support the dividend, but also pressure to increase the stock price,” S. Derek Turner, Research Director at consumer group Free Press, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Buying DirecTV on credit did that. The deal benefited whomever held AT&amp;amp;T’s stock as a dividend source. The customers and potential customers in AT&amp;amp;T service areas didn’t benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDDqR7"&gt;But even some investors grew angry with AT&amp;amp;T’s “growth for growth’s sake” strategy. Activist investors at Elliott Management &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190909005482/en/Elliott-Management-Sends-Letter-to-Board-of-Directors-of-ATT"&gt;penned a letter to AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; in late 2019 complaining the company had spent nearly $200 billion to become “a sprawling collection of businesses battling well-funded competitors,” instead of focusing on core competencies like wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYppfi"&gt;The end result of AT&amp;amp;T’s ambition wasn’t entirely fruitless: HBO Max, the latest in a long line of attempted streaming TV brand refreshes, could still challenge other rising streaming services like Disney Plus or Comcast’s Peacock. But however successful HBO Max winds up being, it’s a product that shouldn’t have cost $200 billion and 55,000 jobs to create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUsMhi"&gt;Ironically, AT&amp;amp;T’s failure comes despite the fact that it spent the better part of a decade lobbying to tilt the regulatory playing field in its favor, culminating in the company’s successful 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687903/net-neutrality-was-repealed-a-year-ago-whats-happened-since"&gt;assault on net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission’s consumer protection authority&lt;/a&gt;. But even abusing broadband usage caps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277402/hbo-max-att-data-caps-netflix-disney-plus-streaming-services-net-neutrality#:~:text=AT%26T%20later%20confirmed%20to%20The,data%20caps%20on%20unlimited%20plans."&gt;give itself a tactical advantage&lt;/a&gt; over streaming competitors didn’t help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8y0QYB"&gt;Ultimately, no amount of money or political power could buy the TV dominance the company’s executives envisioned. And as AT&amp;amp;T struggles to offload the mammoth debt load created by its ambition, employees and customers continue to foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaMPZI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 3rd, 2021 10:27AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22303809/sony-ps5-playstation-5-console-restock-amazon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; currently has &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC5L3RG?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=19&amp;amp;imprToken=eebbfc59-b50c-7f7a-a50&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22067850%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC6MR62?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22067850%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in stock. You can find more information on the retailer's restock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22303809/sony-ps5-playstation-5-console-restock-amazon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPqddq"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="1XN8E0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9564009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7M35PW"&gt;If you are torn between which PS5 console to buy, no need to worry. The biggest difference to note is that the PS5 Digital Edition is smaller than the PS5 standard, costs $399, and it does not include a Blu-ray disc drive. The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has both PS5 consoles in stock again [UPDATE: Sold Out]</title>

  &lt;p id="TjxoNx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 3rd, 2021 11:04AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has sold out of both PS5 console models. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v1Hxy"&gt;Sony’s latest gaming console, the PS5, is one of many gaming gadgets that are hard to find in stock right now due to mostly online-only sales. If you are trying to get your hands on one, Amazon has restocked both the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC6MR62?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC5L3RG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; consoles right now, while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you obtain your PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZS80PC2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a popular game in 2020; it is backwards compatible and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;PS5 port is coming on June 10th&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the game now, you’ll get a free next-gen upgrade when that version is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Uls0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bfKdpX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;I strongly suggest buying &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which is a digital library of some of the most popular first- and third-party titles released on the PS4 such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Remastered. &lt;/em&gt;I also advise picking up &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll53Kj"&gt;If you want to expand your SSD storage, sadly, there is no way to do that just yet. But Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="SBR5ek"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony will reportedly enable PS5 SSD expansion this summer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"},{"title":"Best Buy has stock available for the Xbox Series X and S right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"},{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
