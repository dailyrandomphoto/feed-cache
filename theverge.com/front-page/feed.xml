    <title>Daniel Radcliffe’s about to get real weird in Roku’s Al Yankovic biopic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daniel Radcliffe Talks To Host Hoda Kotb At SiriusXM’s New York Studios" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EMUq1FzGefPcaoOSddXaRq4JVoQ=/80x216:2435x1786/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403769/1334885334.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n3L9Af"&gt;Today, Roku, Funny Or Die, and Tango announced that they’re partnering up to produce &lt;em&gt;WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story&lt;/em&gt;, a biopic written by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/18/14658500/weird-al-unreleased-beatles-parody-pac-man"&gt;“Weird Al” Yankovic&lt;/a&gt; and director Eric Appel, with Daniel Radcliffe attached to star in the lead role. In a statement about the upcoming film, Yankovic spoke about how he sees &lt;em&gt;WEIRD &lt;/em&gt;as his making good on a promise to maintain a dedicated presence in the film space over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8u5M6"&gt;“When my last movie &lt;em&gt;UHF&lt;/em&gt; came out in 1989, I made a solemn vow to my fans that I would release a major motion picture every 33 years, like clockwork. I’m very happy to say we’re on schedule,” Yankovic said. “I am absolutely thrilled that Daniel Radcliffe will be portraying me in the film. I have no doubt whatsoever that this is the role future generations will remember him for.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqxbcB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UHF&lt;/em&gt;, a movie about a man who suddenly gains ownership of a TV station, becoming a cult classic after initially flopping when it hit theaters in 1989 is a testament to his ability to make art that sticks in people’s minds even if they don’t exactly understand its appeal at the time. While no other casting news has currently been announced, one imagines that &lt;em&gt;WEIRD &lt;/em&gt;will feature its fair share of Yankovic’s music, either in recreations of the moments when the musician was first working through them or at significant points in his career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7NJWb"&gt;Though &lt;em&gt;WEIRD &lt;/em&gt;could logically end up skewing so comedic to the point that people don’t come into the movie thinking they should take it seriously, both Yankovic and Radcliffe are the types to zig when you expect them to zag, meaning that the new movie might actually be something to keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfJf3I"&gt;Production on &lt;em&gt;WEIRD: The Al Yankovic Story &lt;/em&gt;is slated to begin in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making sense of new TV features in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zfv8vXMoTrVEZA7t63WnBY-CDTw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403767/cwelch_211209_4929_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a TV can be a confusing ordeal, but it doesn’t need to be&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="FPbhac"&gt;Every year after CES, there can be a new pile of buzzwords and technology shorthand that can go up and over the head of many consumers — even when those acronyms often describe meaningful advancements that are worth knowing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iAPmK"&gt;So with all the latest TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, and others now announced and due to ship over the next few months, it seems an opportune moment to review the features you should be looking for when TV shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZbS1G"&gt;Stay tuned over the coming months for TV and soundbar buying guides. But if you’re in the market for a new TV &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, these are the terms you should be looking for when comparing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IlC419"&gt;What TV hardware features mean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EwF6PQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALLM:&lt;/strong&gt; Auto low latency mode is a useful feature that detects when you’ve plugged a gaming system into your TV (or have started playing a game on a streaming box) and automatically activates the TV’s “game” mode with optimized settings that produce the lowest possible input lag. This means there will be a minimal delay between you pressing a button on the controller and seeing the resulting action in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28AyZw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dolby Atmos:&lt;/strong&gt; An immersive surround sound format that goes beyond previous experiences by introducing height channels, which make audio more three-dimensional. Atmos home theater systems and soundbars often include up-firing speakers to make some on-screen action sound like it’s happening overhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mh7xse"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eARC:&lt;/strong&gt; The enhanced audio return channel is usually labeled on one of your TV’s HDMI ports. This is the port you’ll want to plug your soundbar or home theater system into. On modern TVs, eARC allows for the transmission of uncompressed, immersive 7.1 Dolby Atmos surround sound and eliminates the extremely frustrating audio sync frustrations that can be present when using soundbars on some older TVs. Definitely make sure your next TV has eARC among its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv8hQq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDMI 2.1: &lt;/strong&gt;The “definition” of HDMI 2.1 was recently thrown into disarray when it was discovered that a device or HDMI cable being labeled as compliant with the 2.1 spec &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833233/hdmi-2-1-fake-marketing-brand-frl-vrr-allm-bandwidth"&gt;doesn’t actually guarantee anything&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of focusing on HDMI 2.1, the best practice for consumers is now to check for the specific features like 4K at 120Hz, VRR, and others mentioned in this list. In terms of cables, looking for something that supports 48Gbps throughput is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZatX6_01clx2u87OQkl6HnSrXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23169394/PXL_20211207_175050122.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="azry1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDR: &lt;/strong&gt;High dynamic range is a must-have feature for any TV in 2022. It produces much brighter highlights and deeper, more vivid colors when playing HDR content. Aside from the basic, widely supported HDR10 format, other HDR formats include Dolby Vision, which allows for different picture optimizations on a frame-by-frame basis, and HDR10 Plus, which offers similar benefits but with a smaller content selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXJVTy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MicroLED:&lt;/strong&gt; Throw out everything you know about regular TVs. Samsung’s MicroLED displays bring together the best features of OLED — self-emitting pixels, perfect blacks, and so on — without most of the drawbacks. MicroLEDs use microscopic, inorganic LEDs that individually produce light and color. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ccl3h-ACe8nplg7dofAAJqaNGQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9993913/DSCF2719.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of Samsung’s MicroLED display technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xam34T"&gt;These micrometer-scale LEDs are transferred onto tile-like modules, allowing for a display of various shapes and potentially any size. Samsung also sells more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;TV-like MicroLED displays&lt;/a&gt; at preset sizes. But, unfortunately for most of us, since MicroLED is still a new and costly technology, it’s wildly expensive, and these displays cost more than most cars. (Think over $100,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXDwNs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini LED:&lt;/strong&gt; For the past several years, many of the best LCD TVs have used a backlighting system called “full-array local dimming” with a number of individual LEDs behind the screen that illuminate and dim in accordance with the content being shown. These LEDs form dimming “zones” that allow some areas of the screen to be very dark while other sections might simultaneously be powerfully bright with HDR content. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgjZx9C33x5C7_KPoj2F3hYSNJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23169207/miniled.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psuBWd"&gt;Mini LED iterates upon that approach by shrinking the LEDs significantly — and cramming many, many more of them into the backlight array. The end result is more precise contrast and less “blooming,” which occurs when a halo of light can be seen around bright objects or text on screen. Mini LED doesn’t eliminate blooming altogether, but it’s often less noticeable. All those tiny LEDs also make for better overall brightness uniformity across the TV’s display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1K2Qn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OLED:&lt;/strong&gt; They’ve long been hailed as the best TVs you can buy for a reason: OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs offer perfect blacks thanks to their self-emissive pixels and no need for a traditional backlight. Viewing angles are stellar, contrast is unrivaled, and OLED can make practically anything you put on the screen shine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ydSRDa23gWaRpP6RiJIgFQKigA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128690/cwelch_211209_4929_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OLED TVs offer unbeatable, perfect black levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PdJQOj"&gt;That said, OLED TVs aren’t perfect at &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;: they usually trail LCD TVs in overall brightness, and the possibility of permanent burn-in hasn’t yet been overcome, even if LG, Sony, and other OLED TV makers have measures in place that make the problem very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KcFfJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QD-OLED: &lt;/strong&gt;CES 2022 marked the big debut of QD-OLED panels on both TVs and gaming monitors. These &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876061/samsung-qd-oled-quantum-dot-tv-panels-sgs-certification-brightness-color-viewing-angles"&gt;quantum dot OLED displays&lt;/a&gt; are made by Samsung Display and differ from those manufactured by LG Display because they offer true RGB color reproduction and can maintain vivid colors across the brightness range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d698PA"&gt;Traditional OLEDs emit light through a color filter, but QD-OLED beams blue light through quantum dots to create red and green and produce the rest of the color spectrum. This more efficient approach has benefits, including improved overall brightness levels and even better viewing angles than OLED already offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwz71G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10961963"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LnmLLP"&gt;The first QD-OLED TVs are expected to ship in 2022 and are likely to cost noticeably more than those from LG, so we’ll need some actual hands-on time to determine if these upgraded panels are worth the price premium. But it’s still exciting to see the best TV tech (that normal people can potentially afford) continue to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNYfK0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VRR:&lt;/strong&gt; The latest TVs with variable refresh rate allow games on a PS5 or Xbox Series S / X to adjust their refresh rate at up to 120Hz for much smoother on-screen action. (In 2022, some TVs will increase this as high as 144Hz for PC gaming.) VRR also proves helpful at smoothing out any brief hitches or drops in frame rate to the point that they’re often unnoticeable, letting you focus on the game itself instead of your console’s technical performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OuEw6q"&gt;Terms you should ignore and / or avoid in 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AyMjBS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8K:&lt;/strong&gt; Manufacturers continue to produce new 8K TV models each year, but the entertainment industry as a whole still hasn’t made a dent in the biggest problem area: there’s still a dearth of native 8K content that’s easy to stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cXZse"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edge-lit LED: &lt;/strong&gt;Cheaper LCD TVs will often have edge lighting — with LEDs around the perimeter of the screen instead of behind it — that results in significantly worse picture quality, uneven uniformity, and mediocre black levels compared to sets with local dimming. It can be enticing to buy a giant-sized TV at a low price, but as the old saying goes, if it’s too good to be true, it usually is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Read Microsoft Gaming CEO’s email to staff about the Activision Blizzard acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Phil Spencer Microsoft Xbox stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9C8CHsjcRo85CLn1LXLkWSRGvco=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403709/philspencer2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0M24Xy"&gt;As part of Microsoft’s plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;, the software giant has created a Microsoft Gaming division. Phil Spencer, former head of Xbox, will now lead this team as it focuses on gaming across Xbox, PC, mobile, and the cloud. It’s a big promotion for Spencer, described as the Xboss by Xbox fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ11Oa"&gt;Spencer originally took over as the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/31/5566186/phil-spencer-head-microsoft-xbox-division"&gt;head of Microsoft’s Xbox division in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, reporting to former Windows chief Terry Myerson. In a sign of how gaming has changed at Microsoft under Spencer, he quickly moved into Microsoft’s senior leadership team in 2017, reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as the corporate vice president of gaming. After more than 30 years at the company, Spencer is now CEO of Microsoft Gaming, as it looks to tackle mobile gaming, the metaverse, and cloud gaming with more than 20 game studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZUowK"&gt;Microsoft is now willing to spend billions on acquisitions to bolster its gaming efforts after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;acquiring Bethesda last year for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Activision Blizzard won’t be a particularly easy acquisition for Microsoft, though. The troubled company has been struggling to address concerns from employees over a myriad of sexual misconduct allegations. Spencer and his Microsoft Gaming team will certainly have a lot of work to do to ensure the culture inside Activision Blizzard is addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFhJuN"&gt;Here’s what Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer had to say about his new role and the company’s gaming efforts in an email to staff today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="x6CAWV"&gt;Welcome back from the holidays. To start, I’d like to thank everyone for all of the hard work and dedication that have built this business and this community. Obviously, today’s agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard is incredibly exciting. In fact it’s a milestone for our company, our business and our industry. I and the entire Gaming Leadership Team are deeply enthusiastic about this opportunity. We also announced this morning that we have surpassed 25 million Game Pass subscribers across console, cloud and PC, a great achievement for all of Team Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAEKSi"&gt;As players and partners, we all know how talented and dedicated the teams and studios are across Activision Blizzard. The legendary games and franchises across that company have delighted millions of people for decades. Coming together, we can accelerate our mission to extend the joy and community of gaming to everyone. We have the capability and opportunity to build simply the best, most engaging, most fun entertainment ecosystem anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23vr8J"&gt;Microsoft is committed to our journey for inclusion in every aspect of gaming, among both employees and players. We deeply value individual studio cultures. We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpMjPy"&gt;We expect this acquisition to close in FY23, pending regulatory approvals. Once the acquisition is completed, the Activision Blizzard business will report to me. In the meantime, we know you will have a lot of questions. The Gaming Leadership Team and I look forward to answering as many as we can at our next Monthly Gaming Update on Jan. 26. You can submit your questions now anonymously, or post them on our Team Xbox Yammer. Please also refresh on our corporate social media guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EIoyo"&gt;As Satya mentioned, I am now CEO, Microsoft Gaming. This change is a reflection of the incredible work each of you are doing to create the best entertainment ecosystem anywhere. As a leadership team, we know how much exciting but difficult work we have ahead of us, so it’s crucial that we operate as a single, unified team. To that end, I’m excited to announce effective today that Jerret West, CMO of Gaming, and his marketing team will move from Chris Capossela’s organization to report directly to me. Jerret will continue to be a member of Chris’ leadership team and leverage critical parts of Microsoft’s marketing muscle including Communications, Media, and Consumer Sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJMjEN"&gt;We will have a webcast for investors and media at 6 a.m. PT to discuss the Activision Blizzard transaction and our plans as Microsoft Gaming. Please join if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2VgVK"&gt;Phil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QHRScE"&gt;Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also sent his own email to staff about today’s announcements. Nadella describes gaming as playing “a critical role in the development of metaverse platforms,” that the company is looking to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759379/microsoft-xbox-metaverse-halo-minecraft-flight-sim"&gt;develop for Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758974/microsoft-teams-metaverse-mesh-3d-avatars-meetings-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="D3XC4U"&gt;Team,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flDkSl"&gt;I’m thrilled to share that this morning we announced an agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion. Activision Blizzard is one of the largest game publishers worldwide across console, PC and mobile, and it’s home to nearly 400 million monthly active players, along with iconic games including Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft and Diablo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4xtZW"&gt;Gaming has been key to Microsoft since our earliest days as a company. Today, it’s the largest and fastest-growing form of entertainment, and as the digital and physical worlds come together, it will play a critical role in the development of metaverse platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gABZt0"&gt;Together with Activision Blizzard, we believe we have an incredible opportunity to bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone on the planet, and we will invest and innovate to create the best content, community and cloud for gamers. We want to make it easier for people to connect and play great games wherever, whenever and however they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLHoWr"&gt;This agreement is a testament to the impact our gaming team has delivered, and I am deeply grateful for their hard work and commitment. Over the past few years, we’ve expanded our content pipeline and have become leaders in game subscriptions, as well as cloud gaming. And this holiday it was especially gratifying to see the response from fans and read the great reviews of our new first-party titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyvDAF"&gt;Effective today, Phil Spencer will become CEO, Microsoft Gaming. When the acquisition closes, the Activision Blizzard business will report to Phil. We look forward to extending our journey to create a more diverse and inclusive culture to our new colleagues at Activision Blizzard, and ensuring all our employees can do what they love, while thriving in a safe and welcoming environment — one where everyone feels empowered to do their best work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGYFfb"&gt;I will be hosting a webcast with investors at 6 a.m. PT with Phil and Amy, as well as Bobby Kotick, the CEO of Activision Blizzard, to share more details on our big ambitions for gaming. Please join if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UL3I3a"&gt;Satya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BMwyAp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 18th 10:50AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s memo to staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Volkswagen can reinvent itself as an EV company, with CEO Herbert Diess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o2JqB9JJuxhOgB4ekDcYhFs9rtA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403699/VRG_ILLO_Decoder_Herbert_Diess_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new electric Microbus offers a glimpse at the future of VW&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jXXCtI"&gt;Today, I’m talking to Volkswagen Group CEO Dr. Herbert Diess. Volkswagen is one of the two biggest carmakers in the world — there’s a battle every year between VW and Toyota for the top spot; they both sell around 10 million cars a year. To put that in perspective, Ford sells around 4–6 million cars a year, and Tesla currently sells around 500,000 cars a year. So, yeah, Volkswagen Group is big. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq5khx"&gt;It’s also complicated: Herbert oversees a huge range of familiar car brands: VW, of course, but also Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche, and Bentley, as well as Skoda and Seat in Europe. A recent management shuffle also put him directly in charge of Volkswagen’s software subsidiary, which is called CARIAD, and, of course, he’s in charge of VW’s aggressive efforts to electrify its lineup and shift all its cars to being EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pa1gmY"&gt;And that process has its roots in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/search?q=Dieselgate"&gt;Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcYJc1"&gt;From 2009 to 2015, Volkswagen sold cars with diesel engines that were programmed to circumvent emissions tests, and most countries opened investigations and issued fines. Here in the United States, Volkswagen was ordered to pay $2.7 billion in environmental fees and, importantly, invest $2 billion into clean-emissions infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQKbRY"&gt;That $2 billion investment turned into an EV charging network called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17252088/vw-porsche-electric-car-charging-station-us"&gt;Electrify America&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to expand to 1,800 stations and 10,000 chargers by the end of 2025. For comparison, Tesla already has just over 900 stations and 10,000 chargers. If VW can get it right, it can spin the consequences of Dieselgate into a pretty significant competitive advantage as the country transitions to EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HBPu5"&gt;Herbert and I talked about all of that and the overall transition to EVs, including VW’s new EV microbus, which is very cool. We also talked about how a company like Volkswagen can move as quickly as smaller competitors like Tesla, whether or not Volkswagen will let others buy the software it’s developing for its own cars, how he’s thinking about self-driving cars, and more. If you listen, you’ll notice a real theme is vertical integration: Herbert thinks Volkswagen Group has to do a lot of things itself instead of depending on suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiH2K8"&gt;OK. Herbert Diess, the CEO of Volkswagen Group. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLPYOf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="f2qnxR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udPKuc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lNjcr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbert Diess, you’re the CEO of Volkswagen Group. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aptXN5"&gt;Thank you. I’m excited to be here, Nilay. Thank you for the opportunity. I’m looking forward to your questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnaVfm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a lot to talk about. VW just announced that the Microbus is coming back as an EV. I saw some photos coming out of CES that look very exciting. The Microbus is obviously a legendary car. I think people are excited about it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7su6X5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VW itself has just restructured a bit. You just took over leadership of the software group called CARIAD, which is fascinating. I actually want to start with the basics: VW is a massive major car company that serves lots of businesses and markets. It’s an old company. I don’t think people are familiar with how it works. How is VW structured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnhMSl"&gt;We are kind of a conglomerate of brands. Volkswagen has Skoda, SEAT, and Volkswagen as worldwide brands in the volume manufacturing segment. The premium brands Audi, Bentley, and Lamborghini belong to Volkswagen. Porsche — the top of the range, sportiest cars — belong to the brand. Then we have trucks: Scania and MANs are a totally different business, but also about mobility, it’s about transport. Then we have a couple of service entities. We’re just in the process of acquiring a car rental company — car sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uTc6H"&gt;So, as you said, it’s quite big. It’s complex, but I think it’s a good setup for being successful in the future. We have scale, we have technology, and we have exciting brands. As far as how we are going to run the group: we have quite independent groups of brands. Volume is led by Volkswagen. All premium brands are led by Audi. Porsche is basically on its own. Toward the customer side, the brands are very, very independent, but we share technology. We share hardware and software platforms. We share mobility services and finance. That is how we capitalize on the economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYq7JN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I hear this same idea a lot from car CEOs on the show — you have a house of brands. You want all the brands to be differentiated and operate in whatever segments, whether it’s volume, premium, or sports cars. Volkswagen also owns Lamborghini — I could just talk to you about Lamborghini for an hour –– but you’re going to get economy of scale from centralizing platforms and software. You’re going to have just a few basic platforms, and those platforms are going to be expressed by our brands in various ways. That idea sounds great, but the execution of that idea is obviously very hard. If Volkswagen has a different need for the platform underlying the ID.4 than Audi, how do you make that decision?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edMGm8"&gt;We have been quite successful in platforms now because they are really widely used. Excluding Porsche, all volume brands — Audi included — are using the MQB platform. MQB is a quite versatile platform we are using all over the world: from India, Latin America, China, and Europe. That has advantages because we can really offer the best platform technology at the best price. This is why we are achieving our goals today. For instance, we are basically winning every test comparison, and we share this platform with Audi. It works. With MEB [for electric vehicles], now we get to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="L21t9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ofHKdv"&gt;The world is changing: it is transforming into an electric automotive world where you will have less differentiation when it comes to engines. You still will have differentiation, performance-wise. You will have a rear-wheel drive, front-wheel drive, and all-wheel drive. You will have different sizes of batteries, but when it comes to the converters for the electric units or such, you get much more similarity than we have today in the industry. This is why we think hardware differentiation will probably be decreased in the future. It’s what we also see from the competition: we all share a similar battery. Now, this is a floor bottom battery that can fit in a huge range of cars; this is common. You have rear-wheel and front-wheel electric drives that are very similar in their design. We have a certain differentiation currently between 800-volt and 400-volt technology. We have Porsche and  Audi are running on 800-volt. Volkswagen and the volume brand are on the 400-volt batteries, but we see a conversion even there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="465P2M"&gt;That is why we decided that in an entirely electric future, one platform will do it. This will be a differentiated platform: from 85 kilowatts to 800 and then 1,000 kilowatts at the top of the range. There are a lot of similarities which we can leverage in scale — even more so on the software side. If you drove an Audi or Porsche and Volkswagen today, you would probably have different hardware and software for navigation, for climate control, and even for the window lifter. That’s not necessary. … Software offers a huge opportunity for economies of scale, still allowing for brand differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EJvrz"&gt;Now, a Porsche can remain a Porsche, even better than today. An Audi can remain an Audi, and Volkswagen will offer a broad range of products, but the basic software stack can be very, very similar. Software is relatively expensive in automotive. Now it’s a one-time expenditure. … We think that we have a good chance to also become very competitive in software if we build a common basic software for all the brands. This is exactly why we founded CARIAD: to get from a world where we bought software with the embedded systems to our own software stack. The brands have all the tools and all the freedom to differentiate for sportiness, for comfort — for all sorts of different use cases. This is why we think we are well set up for this new world, where economies of scale will probably play a bigger role than in this old auto world. Differentiation will probably be more difficult, but through software, it will be very, very possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvlTWW"&gt;Plus, we are currently sharing the 800-volt platform between Audi and Porsche. The cars — the Taycan and the Audi GT — are so different in the perception, the range, and in the segments they are running that I think the new world will allow for a lot of differentiation and economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxBXsG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to talk about that in depth, but I just want to ask two more of what I think of as the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; questions. You run a huge company — lots of different kinds of decisions to make, especially as you transition. How do you make decisions? What is your decision-making framework?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkPOWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The best knowledge is in the room.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFjV10"&gt;I think my life experience tells me that normally, the best knowledge is in the room, so I’m always looking for different opinions for a variety of insights for discussion to get to the right decision. Those sole decisions from the stomach — and I’ve experienced some of those — are often wrong. I believe in good team decisions, in a competition for the best ideas. That really works. You have the competence in the team room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ni93"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other question: I interview primarily US-based CEOs. In America, CEOs — especially founder CEOs — are given an enormous amount of executive authority. They tend to run the companies. Maybe they make a lot of those gut decisions. Volkswagen is a European company; it has a big supervisory board. The unions have a lot of seats on that board. Could you explain how that works? Does it constrain your ability to make change as a CEO? For our audience, that setup is very different from any sort of American company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxqtMp"&gt;Yeah, it is. It is complex, and you need more alignment, and a lot of discussion. It doesn’t allow for random decisions because you have to defend your case as a shared interest in the future of the company. You have to talk to your finance audience and convince them that you want to run a business. You can’t make a lot of gut decisions — you can make a few, but then you have to prove you were right. In any business model, you have to explain your story. You have to explain why you have to take the people with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6uN0U"&gt;It’s probably more complex in the Volkswagen world, where the ownership is quite special, I would call it. It’s quite heterogeneous because of several brands. Porsche is totally different from Skoda’s truck brand. Scania’s commercial vehicle brand is totally different from cars. It’s a complex task, but it’s working. We can demonstrate results because we think we are quite fast in the transition. We decided to go for an electric-only platform five years ago. Some of our peers are coming to that conclusion now. We have strong cash flows from our existing business. We are continuously investing. We have invested several billion in software now. We have acquired a car rental company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShT2UK"&gt;We are investing heavily in the transition — probably more than our competitors. That means that we came to that conclusion that we could convince our stakeholders quite early. It’s not necessarily that we get slow, but we have to admit that those founder companies bring a different speed to the game. It’s a new challenge for us, and we have to rethink our processes, rethink our organization, and we have to improve a lot to remain competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knj4VJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s one specific founder/CEO car company that I might be thinking of: Tesla, obviously. Tesla’s great advantage is very tight integration of hardware and software. Even through the chip shortage, Tesla was able to swap out chips and rewrite the software based on what chips were available in a way that virtually no other car company was able to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ES5adb"&gt;No, no — that’s not true. We also do that continuously, but you have to imagine, we are much more complex. We have a variety of supply chains, which makes us — and even the platform strategy — a little bit more vulnerable, but we also already did some redesigns. We are still probably a bit too slow. I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7kwCK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You recently took over the software division, CARIAD. I buy what you’re saying about the future of cars. We’re basically going to have skateboard platforms: the battery and motors and various configurations will go up and down in size and performance. On top of that, you can layer industrial design, and then you can layer user experience. The user experience is not a hardware problem. It’s a software problem, and that problem is very challenging. In many ways, you could say that software is actually the car engineering problem now. How do we own all of the components so that they talk to each other? How do we integrate them? How do we build a compelling user experience? How do we deliver software updates? When you turn the car into a computer, you inherit computer problems. Why is CARIAD a division of Volkswagen instead of Volkswagen, if that is the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu9KFc"&gt;It depends on what you call it. I would say this is Volkswagen. I think you’re absolutely right in your verdict. The differentiation, the competitiveness, and the customer experience will all depend 90 percent on software. Now, I’m still convinced that design, performance, brand image, and marketing will all play a role, but software is becoming really dominant in the integration, but that was always the case. Those successful brands could always demonstrate that the integrity of a product is excellent. A typical Volkswagen had to be a typical Volkswagen for the car to be a success. The same applies to BMW and Mercedes. Product integrity in a complex, open room of solutions has always been a core task. What’s really new is that it’s so decisive to be able to integrate software in the different properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tozNYw"&gt;This is a very difficult task, but it’s also something not so easy to copy because it’s so complex. A car today already is 10 times more complex than a smartphone. It has 10 times more lines of code than a smartphone. The criteria is extremely different. The real-time environments are really difficult: if you think about braking or steering, you have to build in redundancies, and then you have to make the whole thing communicate to each other. Being updateable means that part of your software runs in the cloud, and you get the continuous updates. ... The question is: who is going to succeed? Who can do it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iasHFU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A car today already is 10 times more complex than a smartphone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Temscm"&gt;Your assumption is that we are in a difficult position, and you’re partially right. But I would say that today, no really big company could have a really good car software-wise and hardware-wise, because it’s not so easy to acquire both of those capabilities. The problem we are facing today is that these competencies are between suppliers and sub-suppliers: Bosch, Conti, and ourselves, for example. We need a stronger vertical integration to be competitive. This is where one of our American competitors is probably a little bit ahead of us, but also this American competitor still has to learn some lessons about being trustworthy and reliable — how to deliver on all the promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5A5q0X"&gt;We have to restructure and rebuild new skills and acquire new skills there to be capable. What makes me confident that we can succeed is that any other potential competitor has the same problem. Even for a software company to really understand the necessities and the complexity of a car — it’s a huge task. I haven’t seen a software company so far succeeding. The big supplier companies have a chance. The big American or European suppliers, Bosch, Conti — they would have a chance because they own part of the software stack when it comes to braking and steering. Still, integration, customer interface, and the cloud backend are huge challenges for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvlqv6"&gt;We are in a process. This process will still take a few years until we have companies that are capable of doing the whole stack, run a fleet of cars, continuously update, and deliver on all the customer expectations worldwide. This is a process, and I’m convinced that our setup — strong brands, a hard shift into software, putting all the resources for software together — has a good chance to succeed in that race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Fi6ca"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your point about reliability as well — you just don’t see a lot of Audi owners making YouTube videos about panel gaps on their cars. Actually making the cars is difficult. That is a competency that other companies have to draw up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6fTMQZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Don’t believe that just any of these startups showing one car at a motor show will succeed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Frae7B"&gt;You can learn everything now. This American competitor shows that you can do stunning things if you’re really committed. What I’m saying is: don’t expect that you can do this game in one, or two, or five years. Tesla is a case where it took 15 years, and it took a lot of resources — I don’t know, $15 or $20 billion to get to profitability. Don’t believe that just any of these startups showing one car at a motor show will succeed. Some of them we take seriously, but I’m quite sure that not all will have the substance and durability to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ImR8D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I probably agree with you there. Let me ask you about software: VW is very good at making cars, and manufacturing at scale, and making sure that its vehicles are reliable. You sell a gas car. VW’s cost for that car to maintain it over time is zero: if the customer has a problem with a traditional gas car, they’re on the hook for repairing it — buying new tires and replacing parts and such. That actually can generate some profit for VW and its dealer network over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFTVCg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With a software car, my expectation as a customer is that you are going to continuously provide me with new updates to the software: you’re going to run a cloud service that delivers new backend features, or mapping support, or whatever it is. You’re going to run a radio network and partner with a cell carrier. Those are all costs that VW has to carry just for me to drive the car that I already bought. Where is the revenue that supports those costs? I don’t think people want subscription fees just to operate their cars — or at least I haven’t seen that market develop yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKU7pZ"&gt;It’s probably a bit premature to say that pay-per-use is not going to happen because that subscription framework is really taking a lot of space in other businesses. We also see that the sharing economy is getting momentum. This is basically also why we bought a car rental company: we think this business model of sharing usage will increase fast. Sharing will not substitute ownership, at least not in the next 10 years or so, but it will grow a lot, and this allows for additional revenue streams. I fully agree. We have to run the car, and we have to provide services, but you have to see that this allows us an additional source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKd9gv"&gt;Imagine: for a long time, we did not have access to a customer as a company. The customer access was exclusively with our retail network, basically. What we experienced over time was that people walk away from our retail outlets and go to third parties to substitute some of the spare parts or buy new tires. Now, we have a new opportunity to be in direct contact with the customer, which is totally new for us. It’s a quite violent experience, because we knew that we had customers, but we didn’t know them. Now we’re getting to know them. We get to know their preferences, their anger, and what they love in the cars. We get a much better customer understanding. We also get access to the customers — now we can talk directly to them, and that allows us to deliver better service for the customer over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7fQI4"&gt;For instance, that access allows a very critical figure in our business model: residual values. We are financing a large proportion of our cars — about 60 to 70 percent in some markets; in the US, it’s 90 percent. Residual values offer us more important information than retail prices. You can imagine that with updates, upgrades, knowing about the car, the battery status, you can improve your residuals of the car quite considerably. You can know which extras you need, provide for some features, and you can keep the car fresh. My perception is that there are far more opportunities than risks in these changes. The risk is that you have to acquire new skills; you have to learn to talk to the customer, which is a big challenge for us. You have to learn to deliver good working software updates that keep the customer happy and pleasantly surprised. This learning is a very, very healthy process, and if we take the opportunities, there’s more upside than downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LW5nrP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That opportunity in front of the customer — does that look like commercial opportunities? Are you going to sell more things in the car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFtmg4"&gt;Not only. Right before Christmas, I had a chance to drive the next generation of the software, which we are going to deploy to some of our ID cars in the lineup. It’s a huge improvement in the driver assistance functionality — it’s really empowering. Even in Europe, this driver assistance is better performing than some of our American competitors. This experience of being able to improve the car and the user experience in the hand of the customer is such a new thing. Normally, we would have worked until launch. Then we’d prepare a model year update, and then update after another three years. Then we’d forget the car and think about the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isWlBl"&gt;This idea now of getting the car better in the hands of the customer is really exciting. It’s not only about additional business opportunities. It’s about additional satisfaction: getting close to the customers to understand them better. This will change our business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riRadA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to me about that. That’s a big change: you have engineers working on the ID.4’s driver assistance stack. You have to pay them — and I assume you pay them well — which is a cost. Then the engineers have to deliver the stack over a network. You have to provision and provide for that wireless network that will hit the car. That’s all just cost. I agree with you that this is a great benefit to the customer — but at some point, you have to line up revenue against that cost. That is the heart of the business model change: instead of assuming that there’s a two- or three-year upgrade cycle, you’re weighing the cost of supporting the cars for longer and comparing those costs with the revenue associated with that platform support. Are you realizing any of that revenue yet? Are those plans in place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSqW8A"&gt;We have that revenue in mind for sure as well. Customers will be prepared for some features they didn’t buy at the start, probably after a few years or after a few months — even if they consider taking another option or another software feature, the customers would be prepared to pay a monthly fee or a one-time expenditure. We estimate that the big difference is that we keep the residual value of the car higher, we keep the car fresher, and we get a better customer experience. When Apple started the smartphone business, the income from their services, from the apps, was very, very low. Now, it’s—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d57V5s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fan1KU"&gt;Reasonable. Yeah. That income is reasonable, but still, they are making a large margin on their hardware because people are prepared to pay for it because of the services they get. I think this logic will also apply to our industry. People will not buy any more cars that will fade out quickly and lose residual value fast. State-of-the-art will be a decisive customer criteria. At the end, it’s about competition: if we can deliver better service, better cars, and a better customer experience, then the customers are prepared to pay for mobility. We see that mobility has a value. Customers are probably even prepared to spend more on mobility because they love mobility. They love cars; they love individual mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6X517x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you a very reductive question: do you think the future of Volkswagen is a hardware company, a software company, or a services company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqThrz"&gt;It’s combined. It’s all three. We will remain a hardware company because we need excellent manufacturing skills as well as finish quality in the future designs. We need direct customer contact, so we will remain part of that. Software will be decisive for the differentiation and for gaining the economies of scale, so we will become a software company as well — talking to the customer and delivering day in and day out. We will also become a service company because mobility will change. Pay-by-use sharing fleets, mobility services, and autonomous vehicles will change mobility quite considerably. People may not own a car anymore: they may just use cars, and we will be a part of that game. We will definitely become all three of those companies, so we will remain a bit complex, but a lot more vertically integrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hD1zxy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve talked to a lot of CEOs of companies that make components of autonomous cars. We had the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22298001/luminar-austin-russel-ceo-interview-self-driving-cars"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEO of Luminar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on the show and the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627847/argo-ai-bryan-salesky-decoder-interview-lyft-self-driving"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEO of Argo AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. You partner with Argo; they make very advanced autonomous systems. There’s even an ID Buzz prototype driving itself around various cities. Argo AI is a software supplier: they make a package, and then they sell it to you in the way that your traditional suppliers would sell you seats or door handles. Do you think that’s something you have to vertically integrate, or can you still have suppliers like that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQA48v"&gt;Actually, we don’t treat Argo as a supplier, we own a major stake in Argo. We have a lot of equity in Argo, and we have a very close and trustful relationship with the management team there. We provide knowledge and integration into the car. We run the fleets. In the end, it’s not about software: it’s about good integration between the right sensor setup, the right computer hardware to make all the perception, the planning, and then finally making the right decisions to run the car safely. Our aim is to be able to drive a car as Volkswagen. We have two areas: one is pushing robotaxi technology with Argo. This involves shuttle services, limited areas, relatively slow speeds — they are typically ODD, which is learned and programmed. Then it goes area by area and city by city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djTyb0"&gt;The other way we are pushing is private mobility: we have the Audi team and CARIAD team working on that because we think that autonomous driving will not only cover this area of robotaxis, but also private cars. Step by step: first we tackle driving at level three or level four on open highways — German autobahns — and then we get into more complex areas. This will happen at the same time. It’s two different technologies. Some of our approaches involve sharing computing technology. Some sensors are shared — but ultimately those tasks are so different. At one stage, you think about a completely autonomous car, which is able to handle an area right from the start. On the other hand, you think about driving at higher speeds in a less complex area in a car that is also able to take over from a driver for a certain period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Bqltj"&gt;That leads to different approaches, to different sensor concepts, to different algorithms, and to different AI learning tasks. That is why we are pushing both. In both areas, sooner or later, we clearly have the target to be able to drive the car. Those [robotaxis] have three different business layers. One is the platform — the customer interface. You have to book the car and pay for the car, and that is on a platform level. Then someone has to run the fleets, someone has to build the cars, and someone has to run the autonomous driver. This is currently Argo AI, which is why we have a stake in that company: we also want shared ownership in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlG4t9"&gt;On the other side, yes, we also have suppliers there. We’re working with Bosch in the other area, but we want to become able to really drive the car, because we think the big differentiator is — and the big step change in the industry is — are you able to take over the responsibility for driving the car? That makes a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KR48aJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do you think Volkswagen will sell a car without a steering wheel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8Eht8"&gt;Difficult to say. First thing will probably be the fleets we are running now together with Argo AI. We should get started in 2025 or 2026. Now, those will still have the steering wheel for getting the car back from certain locations, but towards 2030, we should be able to sell cars without a steering wheel for transport services. Now, for private use, most of those cars would probably still have a steering wheel in case of heavy weather conditions, for example — or let’s say you drive into a very remote area where the car is not able to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl6PA8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve talked a lot about software. One of the highest margin things you can do once you develop the software is sell it or license it to someone else. This is maybe the foundational conflict in the traditional computer industry: Microsoft is very successful as a software licensing business. Apple is very successful, but they will never license anything to anyone — Apple wants to sell an integrated product. Android is very successful as a licensing business. Where do you land? Once you’ve built all this capability, will you license the software to other companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vYCFgU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you compare us to Apple or Google, currently we are running like Google.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dVmWdX"&gt;It’s very difficult to predict. Right now we are very open. We are sharing the platform with Ford because we think that the economies of scale we can generate are beneficial for both companies. Ford in Europe is using our MEB platform, and that applies for hardware and software. We predict that there won’t be too many really self-sufficient software stacks in the world because they will be really expensive to maintain and update worldwide. We are currently considering sharing, and would be open to partnering, as long as that doesn’t slow us down. We are prepared. If you compare us to Apple or Google, currently we are running like Google. We are open to third parties to use our technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1t8O96"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned Google and Ford. I had &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford CEO Jim Farley on the show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Ford signed a big deal with Google to do the user interface, provide mapping services, application support — all that stuff in the car. What Jim said to me was, “Look, Ford isn’t any good at this. I’m done throwing money at it when I can just buy it from Google, and we’re going to do the stuff we’re good at.” Are you thinking about similar kinds of deals where you would hand over navigation to Google Maps or something like that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFPn58"&gt;I can’t compare us to Ford, but we think we are not too bad at it. If I compare our routing capabilities, which we currently have in the car based on map data and our own routines, in some cases, our routing is better,  more accurate and leads you faster to the target than Google does. If we compare charging infrastructure data, we absolutely can compete. We believe that it’s necessary to keep control on this domain of user interaction, because now it makes a difference if the user talks to Google versus talking to Audi or Porsche. We can deliver a specific service. CARIAD will help us because bundling all the synergies in the group is 10 million cars every year. We have a chance for the right economy of scale. We are also open to third parties to deliver: we will not close the windows for Google, because we are working in some car lines with Google support. We have a good relationship, but Google knows that we will try very, very hard to stay independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Thcv3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to make sure we talk about the Microbus and EVs. You just mentioned EV charging networks, and you’ve announced the new Microbus that seems like it’s coming soon. If you think about car design, that skateboard, is the Microbus the sort of thing you can just execute now faster? It has a nostalgic design, and you can just make it happen as an electric vehicle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doK5Ea"&gt;Yeah, definitely. The electrification gave us the chance to bring it back. The Microbus in its historic time frame was quite unique: it offered a huge amount of space on a very reduced platform size. It’s a relatively small car with a huge interior. As auto technology developed over time, cars have become much more complex. Engine technology has become much more complicated, much more bulky, and much more voluminous. Over time, the car lost its initial room efficiency. Room efficiency means you have lots of room to move, to sit, to work, to rest, to camp on a reduced size of a platform. Only electrification and the MEB could bring back this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npfxgi"&gt;In this new Microbus, the interior size is much bigger than the existing T7 bus, which we are offering on the platform of a reduced size even compared to the current ICE [internal combustion engine] car. What we really bring back is that initial room efficiency rather than a huge space. You have very low angle overhangs over the front, very much like the first Microbus. You typically need a one-box design, and that is why electrification brought back this opportunity. When I joined Volkswagen, bringing back the Microbus was a dream of mine because it is probably the most emotional car the world has ever seen. It came at the right time: in the hippie era of the ‘60s, the Microbus was a cultural item. It created so much positive awareness, not just in the United States, but worldwide — though not in China because they didn’t experience it — but in the rest of the world, the Microbus is so nicely perceived. It’s so tied to positive memories of Volkswagen that it’s really a brand essence. From my first day at Volkswagen, my wish was to bring this car back to life, and only electrification gave us that opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvrHxu"&gt;There were probably six or seven attempts to bring back this initial icon, but the real chance came with electrification. We pushed it through and I’m really excited. I think America is waiting for this product. In Europe, many people are looking forward to it. I think the team has done a great job: the car will perform very nicely as a modern car while still awakening all those memories of freedom from the very liberal time of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffXrXf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During that time period, the Microbus and the Beetle were very accessible cars. They were not expensive. How much is the new Microbus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2B3DK"&gt;I can’t say. The American team has to decide on that. It’s premature because the car will only come to America next year. It’s not yet decided as the car will have the newest features and a lot of range. It will not be as cheap as the first Microbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ctfp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of my pet peeves across the entire car industry — everyone is doing this — is the announcement of an EV that is not going to arrive for a year or more. Why do you think this happens? You’re announcing the Microbus in March, but it’s arriving in 2023. Will we wait a year, or even longer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXaclD"&gt;In America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2VF40"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XQHmU"&gt;Yeah, in America, but we announced it because it’s hitting the ground here in Europe. I’ll give you the background. When I pushed very hard for this project — I have to say that I really fought for this project because it was very important for me. There was quite a lot of skepticism when we made the decision in 2015 as to whether EVs would work at all, and whether this would be a good investment or a bad investment. You have to imagine that this was still during the Trump administration: our American colleagues had been very conservative on their volume perspectives at that time, which led to a situation where the decision to bring the car to America was made very late. It required some modifications for the local American specs, which is why the car is coming much later in the US. I feel sorry about that, and I apologize for it, because I think the car is really important for America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeXlDN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can tell that you love this car. When is it coming out in Europe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4yOvk"&gt;We have our market introduction in the first quarter, and then it should come midyear to the customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzlfJA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the way, I want this car, so the faster you can get it, the better. But I want to talk about charging infrastructure. We just had United States Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg on the show. He wants to expand infrastructure. He wants to subsidize chargers in places where they wouldn’t necessarily be profitable now. You run Electrify America — that’s a Volkswagen project that came out of the Dieselgate settlement with California. Do you want to run Electrify America? When you have to do that because of a settlement related to a scandal, there’s a part of me that suspects that you’re doing it begrudgingly. There’s another part of me that thinks of this as a huge opportunity to own the major charging network in America.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FZs6l"&gt;From the beginning, of all the penalties we received in America, I most liked this idea of a charging network because the idea of paving the way for our electric cars — or even making electric cars viable in America — would ultimately be an asset for us. I really liked it, but still, this was a big investment. It’s not going to pay off too soon, but over time, we are noticing that charging will be a business model. There’s not a lot of investment going into charging now. Of all the petrol companies, Shell is currently the biggest charging network. There’s a lot of business potential in charging. We also see that our incomes are gradually improving because the usage is getting higher. With every electric car we’re selling, it’s getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvm61K"&gt;We are not doing this only in America: we have been founding charging networks in joint ventures in Italy and Spain; we are invested in IONITY, which is a fast charging network across Europe. We have also invested in a fast charging network in China because we think it’s necessary for electrification. By the way, our American competitor is showing that it can be done. What we see is that it’s a huge opportunity in charging. Just a few days before Christmas, I had the opportunity to open a charging hub for Audi, which is a premium charging center in a location close to Nuremberg. This will be a wonderful experience: you have fast charging, you get there with your Audi app, you plug in your car. Then you enjoy a lounge atmosphere where you can wash your hands, you can have a drink, you can answer your emails. Charging will be part of the mobility experience and there will be a premium experience covering these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqUK5K"&gt;That is why we think charging will play a major role. Supplying the energy, dealing with energy — it gets much more complex because the prices for electric energy are fluctuating. …. You have to be able to buffer, and cars will provide a huge opportunity to be able to contribute to net stability [in the electric grid], because you basically can load the car when there’s a surplus [of energy]. We will experience times where you get your refueling for free, because there’s just so much energy surplus because of so many renewables in the network. This is a new business model and we want to participate. Yes, in America, this program was not entirely voluntary at the beginning, but ultimately I think it was the baseline for one of our strategic approaches into the EV business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHanS2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think about the pace of investment in building the charging network there? You’ve described perhaps premium charging experiences. You’ve described partnering with power companies — maybe changing how you meter or pay for that. However, you still need lots of chargers and lots of places to make all this work. I’m looking at the numbers here. You expect to have 1,800 fast charging stations and 10,000 chargers in America by the end of 2025. There are already 10,000 Tesla Superchargers. Is that fast enough?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkUzGW"&gt;In some countries, we are already ahead of Tesla. That’s fast enough because it has to match the growth of the fleet. But you’re absolutely right: we can’t do all the investment out of our cash flows. We are partnering and we are also looking at some areas, for instance, batteries. Batteries are a much bigger concern for me because the investment there is still bigger than in charging. We will even consider IPOs, or allowing certain parties to participate in the growth, because there will be a lot of growth in the area of EV charging and batteries, and I’m sure that we will find investors to participate, but we can’t finance all of the necessary investment out of our cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr8Jox"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the ways to reduce that investment is to standardize: either standardize batteries across the industry — which doesn’t appear to be happening — or standardizing the plugs and the charging infrastructure, which is slow going. There is some interest. Every now and again, Elon Musk talks about opening Superchargers. We had the CEO of Polestar on, he says, “Yeah, they talk about it, but it’s never going to happen.” Do you think we’re going to see an actual push from the industry to standardize charging, especially fast charging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2d0KW"&gt;Aside from this proprietary network, which is quite established already worldwide, the rest is really usable industry-wide. When it comes to billing or charging, there are different standards and different price tags. Here in Europe, you can use every pole that is not Tesla. It’s a positive move from Tesla to consider opening up their network; Tesla has to decide on that. My perception is that the charging network actually is growing very, very fast. At least in Europe, I drove electric cars basically the whole year during 2021. I’ve driven about 15,000 kilometers. I was in Italy yesterday, I came back through Austria. It was only once that I had to wait on a charging pole. In the US, you can go from the West Coast to the East Coast without stopping. I think we overstate the issue — it’s growing really fast, and there’s so much investment going in. It’s not only auto: now everyone is investing in charging networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrdliH"&gt;The utilities companies, the petrol companies — now they also are changing swiftly. Currently, for instance, we agreed with BP. They’re running the biggest refueling network in Germany. We will convert all the fuel stations into charging within a two-year time period. There’s a lot of investment going in, and I think it will be in line with the growth of EVs. The bigger constraint might be batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPPQup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You actually just shifted battery suppliers, right? You went from LG Chem to CATL in China. Is that —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huhSot"&gt;No, we didn’t shift. We have to use all of the suppliers because we’re growing. It’s just so much that no sole company would have been able to do all the investment. Just recently, we decided to build our own battery group. Thomas Schmall is leading that, a colleague of mine. We are also looking, for later, at some external companies — we will finance the first plants ourselves, but we will invest in batteries because so much growth is necessary, and we couldn’t find enough suppliers to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r58Ua"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a kind of consistent theme of our conversation — needing to vertically integrate. Every area we talk about, your answer is, “We’ve got to do it ourselves.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLZKCm"&gt;I mean, not 100 percent, no — but whenever it’s necessary. The new business model requires it. You can’t run electric cars without networks and without batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOpev9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We see all this demand. Is there a reason that the industry has not created suppliers to meet that demand, and all the companies are kind of doing it themselves right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdiE1e"&gt;A good question. I have to tell you a story there, because I used to work for another company in 2012 or 2013, when I first visited a small company in China, which was called CATL. CATL would then have a turnover of, I think, 200 to 300 million. They would do pouch cells for smartphones for a big American customer. I visited them and said, “I need battery cells for cars — first for plug-in hybrids, and then for electric cars.” The guys looked at me and said, “We can’t do cars. It’s too big. We don’t have the facilities.” They were really not prepared, but I could convince them. Robin Zeng is the CEO and founder. Once in a while, I follow up with him. He made an exceptional transition. He’s now the second biggest battery manufacturer. Market capitalization is about $200 billion, something like that. Extremely fast growth and innovation at CATL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOmMwq"&gt;I tried the same with the German first-tier suppliers. They would have been well-prepared. Bosch, Conti, you name them, I tried the same approach. I knew that we would need a huge amount of battery cells. The turnover of our battery cell business perspective to 2030 — when we would build 50 percent EVs — we’ll have a turnover only for the internal demand of 20 billion, which is half the size of Bosch. It’s a huge business, but I have to say, I could not convince any of our first-tiers besides CATL to invest in batteries, which I regret. Now we have to do it ourselves. We have invested in Northvolt, which is a European startup. We are working with the entire industry — LG, Samsung, CATL — because we need the quantity of batteries and the quality of batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy79jm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This all tracks with what you’ve said: VW will stop selling gas cars in Europe by 2035. Is that data driven by the availability of batteries and infrastructure? When do you think you’ll have enough batteries? When will there be charging infrastructure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbdVbh"&gt;Not necessarily. I think this transition into EVs has certain constraints. I think the plan to get to 50 percent EV by 2030 is extremely ambitious. If we own, here in Europe, about 20 percent market share, for that 20 percent market share to maintain 50 percent EVs, we need six gigafactories. Those factories would have to be up and running by 2027, 2028 to be able to deliver on our 2030 goal. It’s close to impossible to do that. I have high respect for our team who is facing the challenge because you have to buy all the machine tools. You have to build the plants. You have to find the locations. You have to train the people. You have to make sure that the supply of the raw materials is safeguarded and is good. This is huge. We are only 20 percent of the market, so six plants. Europe needs 30 of those plants. Each plant is two by one kilometers. Huge quantities of raw materials have to be moved. This will be challenging. Then to let’s say, get from 50 percent to 100 percent, it still will be a tremendous challenge. It’s not just saying, “Let’s switch off ICE cars.” It’s just impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="q0Px8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Electric cars only make sense if the energy is renewable — only if the energy is really green energy that comes from wind or solar or nuclear.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uE9Bwj"&gt;The second thing is that electric cars only make sense if the energy is renewable — only if the energy is really green energy that comes from wind or solar or nuclear. As long as we have nations based on producing electric energy from coal, it doesn’t make sense to sell electric vehicles there. Think about Poland: I believe it’s 100 percent coal currently. Before we sell electric cars, we have to convert the primary sector into 100 percent renewables. It’s already fine in France, in Norway, in Austria, in Europe, in some parts of America, and in some parts of Canada — but this has to go hand in hand with the conversion of primary energy production. This requires time, and this is why two ambitious plans will not work. That will be counterproductive, even, because running EVs on coal-fired car plants is even worse than running gasoline cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NjlMH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America has a very complicated power story. You have not announced the date for the discontinuation of gas cars in North America. When do you think that will be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkDxP2"&gt;It’s hard to say. Some of our peers are making statements, and I’m not sure whether they should do that because ultimately, this is a decision a car manufacturer cannot make alone. You have to ask yourself: do I have the primary energy? Do I have the networks? Are the people prepared to switch to electric cars? Do they have the right incentives? If you look in Europe, diesel now has been at 90 cents or one euro for a few months. It’s very difficult to compete with an EV car against such low prices, so this has to go hand in hand. The rollout of EVs will depend on the legislation and on the buildup of renewables, and this will be dependent on state policies and on a comprehensive policy — not individual decisions of car manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSSDxg"&gt;We are second or third position in the Latin American markets — in Brazil and in Argentina. They run their cars on a base of ethanol, which is basically CO2-free, though not entirely. It’s bioethanol. For them, it just doesn’t make sense to switch, so far, to electric cars. They would still need combustion engine technology. There’s a lot of buses now in India becoming electric, but 90 percent of their energy production is on coal. We have to change. We still had a coal-fired power plant here in Wolfsburg, in our headquarters. We decided some three years ago to dismantle and substitute it with a gas engine, which allows for CO2 savings comparable to 870,000 cars per year. That is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oflbn"&gt;I probably received a call every week from countries like India: they wanted to buy this coal-fired power plant, and just to build it up somewhere else. We could avoid it in the end, it was not easy, but think about it: it doesn’t make sense to electrify the mobility world if we don’t first make the primary sector CO2-neutral. The world is not the same. In France, they have seven grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour, because it’s all nuclear. In Poland, they have 1,000 grams because it’s all coal-based. It’s the same in South Africa. The rollout has to be staggered. It has to be primary energy, cars, networks, then primary energy, then cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry40TO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing that’s facing the entire car industry up and down is the chip shortage. We’ve seen various ways of dealing with it. Some automakers are holding their cars back. Some like BMW are shipping cars without features and offering $500 credits because the cars don’t have touchscreens. My father-in-law just bought a pickup truck, and the heated seats don’t work. He has to go back when the chip is available so they can install it. There are a variety of solutions to the chip shortage. How is VW dealing with it? When do you see it ending?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxzSpb"&gt;Good question. It’s always the time between the years, as we call it — between year end and start of the year — to rethink and reconsider. With the achievements of 2021, I was really, really happy. I think we made a lot of progress. The teams performed extremely well. We gained market share in some areas. My outlook for 2022 is very, very positive, except for the chip supply. We suffered a lot. We lost market share in China because of the chip supply, and in Latin America because we prioritized the higher spec cars and the premium brands. That was quite a difficult situation, and we have to see that this is a structural problem which will continue. We will still have constraints. We will manage better than last year. We had quite a good start the first two weeks, but there are constraints visible. Those constraints are structural because the chip demand is just growing so fast, and we are very dependent on second and third tier supply from the chip manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hS0DfF"&gt;We are trying to do our best to sort, to help, to improve, to get higher margins for the chip industry, because ultimately it makes a lot of difference whether the same chip ends up in a refrigerator or in a car. In a car, it gets a much higher contribution, so we’re trying to really push and squeeze. We have a task force running. I’m optimistic that we can do better than last year. Will we be able to deliver all the cars we wanted? No, because we have a really, really strong demand. We will have some constraints still, which is my biggest — I wouldn’t call it a headache, but I have a lot of focus on this area, I have to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1iBzK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do you think it’s going to even out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZLxLO"&gt;I think we will continuously improve over time because capacities will shift into higher margins, which are cars, but it’s a structural problem, and there’s a lot of investment getting into chip manufacturing. It’s a three-year investment period until we see that. I’m quite sure we will see constraints through 2022. Hopefully, by 2023 we will get back to satisfying demand. Then I should have a new setup because we are digging much deeper into chip design and chip supply. We are influencing much more and getting into direct sourcing. We have dialogue across our first tiers into direct chip production. We’re doing a lot. We will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxg2ul"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me bring this all the way back around, then I promise I’ll ask you an easy one. You started by explaining how the company is structured and where the growth is. You said that VW is not very strong in America right now, but that you want to get stronger. You think you have a product portfolio, and you’ll go from 4 percent, to 8 percent, to 10 percent market share. Will that growth come in EVs, or will it be a mixture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HyD84"&gt;It will mostly come from EVs. We are trying to push the market share with EVs. I think we have a good chance with products like the Microbus and the ID models, which are well perceived, and are selling very nicely. There are a few more models to come that would suit the Americas. We are considering some more Audi models for America. It’s not yet all decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1fPWb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And those are all EVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbTam0"&gt;Yeah. It’s not all decided yet, but I think this electrification allows us for a redefinition of our market position, of our brand perception. I’m 100 percent sure that it gives us a new chance for getting back to where we should be: a volume manufacturer in the United States with a proud manufacturing footprint in Chattanooga, becoming much more of an American company once again. We are too Chinese and too European for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYf965"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the easy one: what is your daily driver? If I had your job, I would only drive Lamborghinis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKF2fw"&gt;That’s at least what I’m driving. I drive Urus once in a while — people would already look at me. No, actually, this year I mostly drove electric cars, usually an ID.3. I have two: one here in Wolfsburg and one in Munich. It’s also so I can share the customer experience — how is the car working? How are our networks working? I like to drive electric cars: one or the other Audi models. I have the privilege that I can swap cars, which is really good. I have to say, I have kind of a fallback: I will get a Golf R as my next car for the next half year or so, which I’m also looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94fRxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very good. If it was me, it would just be Lamborghinis. Herbert, it was great to have you on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Thank you so much for making the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tqddMC"&gt;Yeah. Thank you, Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s beautiful Cuphead show gets a new trailer and a February release date</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It premieres soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GF3mV3"&gt;Netflix announced Tuesday that its years-in-the-making show based on the &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; video game premieres on February 18th, and it has debuted an action-packed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sel3fjl6uyo"&gt;new trailer&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the release to give you an idea of what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OH6Prl"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; game’s stunning hand-drawn animation inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378364/cuphead-art-design-1930s-animation"&gt;1930s cartoons&lt;/a&gt; made it an obvious candidate for an eventual TV series, and based on the trailer, it looks like the show will be an entertaining ride. People who have played the game might spot a lot of familiar characters from the tough-as-nails sidescroller — there’s Cuphead and his brother Mugman, of course, and some of the game’s iconic bosses make appearances, too. The trailer also reveals that Ms. Chalice, who will join the &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22816788/cuphead-the-delicious-last-course-dlc-ms-chalice-release-date"&gt;in the upcoming DLC&lt;/a&gt;, will be a part of the show as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMKgGW"&gt;If you’re excited for &lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt; after watching the new trailer, you might also want to check out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22466235/netflix-the-cuphead-show-geeked-week-teaser-wayne-brady-king-dice"&gt;first teaser&lt;/a&gt;, which stars none other than Wayne Brady as the diabolical King Dice. But you should know that if you plan to resubscribe to Netflix to watch the series, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k"&gt;the company just raised prices across all of its plans in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new use for AI: summarizing scientific research for seven-year-olds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DSvpKd5QQuA-30m5dkjAhF5iaGs=/102x0:778x451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403552/tldr_paper_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr papers shows AI’s potential to condense research&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="c0n0xd"&gt;Academic writing often has a reputation for being hard to follow, but what if you could use machine learning to summarize arguments in scientific papers so that even a seven-year-old could understand them? That’s the idea behind &lt;a href="https://www.tldrpapers.com/"&gt;tl;dr papers&lt;/a&gt; — a project that leverages recent advances in AI language processing to simplify science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEiuj6"&gt;Work on the site began two years ago by university friends Yash Dani and Cindy Wu as a way to “learn more about software development,” Dani tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;but the service went viral on Twitter over the weekend when academics started &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tldrpapers.com&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;sharing AI summaries of their research&lt;/a&gt;. The AI-generated results are sometimes inaccurate or simplified to the point of idiocy. But just as often, they are satisfyingly and surprisingly concise, cutting through academic jargon to deliver what could be mistaken for child-like wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLp36d"&gt;Take this summary of a paper by Professor Michelle Ryan, director of the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership at the Australian National University. Ryan has written on the concept of the “&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20159315"&gt;glass cliff&lt;/a&gt;,” a form of gender discrimination in which women are placed in leadership roles at times when institutions are at their greatest risk of failure. The AI summary of her work? “The glass cliff is a place where a lot of women get put. It’s a bad place to be.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O32bHY"&gt;“It is just excellent,” as Ryan put it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u7NJHJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This website rewrites your abstract so a 2nd grader can understand it. It is just excellent: &lt;a href="https://t.co/khIwWtWloJ"&gt;https://t.co/khIwWtWloJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Lb2z46pidW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Lb2z46pidW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prof Michelle Ryan (@shellkryan) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shellkryan/status/1481969688427233280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x4sJ8f"&gt;Ryan tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;the summary was “accurate and pithy,” though it did elide a lot of nuances around the concept. In part, this is because of a crucial caveat: tl;dr papers only analyzes the &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; of a scientific paper, which is itself a condensed version of a researcher’s argument. (Being able to condense an entire paper would be a much greater challenge, though it’s something machine learning researchers are already working on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7iNDX"&gt;Ryan says that although tl;dr papers is undoubtedly a very fun tool, it also offers “a good illustration of what good science communication should look like.” “I think many of us could write in a way that is more reader-friendly,” she says. “And the target audience of a second-grader is a good place to start.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZntTk"&gt;Zane Griffin Talley Cooper, a PhD candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, described the AI summaries as “refreshingly transparent.” He used the site to condense a paper he’d written on “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517211015430"&gt;data peripheries&lt;/a&gt;,” which traces the physical history of materials essential to big data infrastructure. Or, as tl;dr papers put it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PQm133"&gt;“Big data is stored on hard disk drives. These hard disk drives are made of very small magnets. The magnets are mined out of the ground.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="xkG1E6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Y’all &lt;a href="https://t.co/eZw3712jVd"&gt;https://t.co/eZw3712jVd&lt;/a&gt; is incredible. It translates your abstract so that a 2nd grader can understand it. If anyone wants to skip my article, here’s the tl;dr… &lt;a href="https://t.co/JrbS90V84b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JrbS90V84b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zane Griffin Talley Cooper (@ZaneGTCooper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZaneGTCooper/status/1482191418735173639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4AA5s"&gt;Cooper says although the tool is a “joke on the surface,” systems like this could have serious applications in teaching and study. AI summarizers could be used by students as a way into complex papers, or they could be incorporated into online journals, automatically producing simplified abstracts for public consumption. “Of course,” says Cooper, this should be only done “if framed properly and with discussion of limitations and what it means (both practically and ethically) to use machine learning as a writing tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bjJbor"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AI language tools have been incorporated into software from Microsoft and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YOJSIT"&gt;These limitations are still being explored by the companies that make these AI systems, even as the software is incorporated into ever-more mainstream tools. tl;dr papers itself was run on GPT-3, which is one of the best-known AI writing tools and is made by OpenAI, a combined research lab and commercial startup that works closely with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwYcEm"&gt;Microsoft has used GPT-3 and its ilk to build tools like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451144/microsoft-gpt-3-openai-coding-autocomplete-powerapps-power-fx"&gt;autocomplete software for coders&lt;/a&gt; and recently began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758963/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-azure-cloud-service-ai-language"&gt;offering businesses access to the system&lt;/a&gt; as part of its cloud suite. The company says GPT-3 can be used to analyze the sentiment of text, generate ideas for businesses, and — yes — condense documents like the transcripts of meetings or email exchanges. And already, tools similar to GPT-3 are being used in popular services like Google’s Gmail and Docs, which offer AI-powered autocomplete features to users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewV7xj"&gt;But the deployment of these AI-language systems is controversial. Time and time again, it’s been shown that these tools encode and amplify harmful language based on their training data (which is usually just vast volumes of text scraped off the internet). They repeat &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/23/1011116/chatbot-gpt3-openai-facebook-google-safety-fix-racist-sexist-language-ai/"&gt;racist and sexist stereotypes and slurs&lt;/a&gt; and may be biased in more subtle ways, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o275t1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This site is pure gold   &lt;a href="https://t.co/jhdLi642vq"&gt;https://t.co/jhdLi642vq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I am pretty sure that I will be criticized for this post by people who see me as "anti-conservation". But I’m not anti-conservation. I am just anti-bad conservation. I am"&lt;a href="https://t.co/JTMbeK8LmZ"&gt;https://t.co/JTMbeK8LmZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KateDeMass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KateDeMass&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anthfletch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@anthfletch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8IMQ9pyXSw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8IMQ9pyXSw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josie Chambers (@jo_chamb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jo_chamb/status/1482682514086977536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyZCXy"&gt;A different set of worries stems from the inaccuracy of these systems. These tools only manipulate language on a statistical level: they have no human-equivalent understanding of what they’re “reading,” and this can lead to some very basic mistakes. In one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/soft/status/1449406390976409600"&gt;notorious example&lt;/a&gt; that surfaced last year, Google search — which uses AI to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22696268/google-search-on-updates-ai-mum-explained"&gt;summarize search topics&lt;/a&gt; — provided misleading medical advice to a query asking what to do if someone suffers a seizure. While last December, Amazon’s Alexa responded to a child asking for a fun challenge to do by telling them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856832/amazon-alexa-challenge-child-dangerous-electricity-algorithm"&gt;touch a penny to the exposed prongs of a plug socket&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLwZrp"&gt;The specific danger to life posed by these scenarios is unusual, but they offer vivid illustrations of the structural weaknesses of these models. Jathan Sadowski, a senior research fellow in the Emerging Technologies Research Lab at Monash University, was another academic entertained by tl;dr papers’ summary of his research. He says AI systems like this should be handled with care, but they can serve a purpose in the right context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxoORT"&gt;“Maybe one day [this technology will] be so sophisticated that it can be this automated research assistant who is going and providing you a perfect, accurate, high quality annotated bibliography of academic literature while you sleep. But we are extremely far from that point right now,” Sadowski told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The real, immediate usefulness from the tool is — first and foremost — as a novelty and joke. But more practically, I could see it as a creativity catalyst. Something that provides you this alien perspective on your work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kEbri5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I could see it as a creativity catalyst. Something that provides you this alien perspective on your work.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJD7Is"&gt;Sadowski says the summaries provided by tl;dr papers often have a sort of “accidental wisdom” to them — a byproduct, perhaps, of machine learning’s inability to fully understand language. In other scenarios, artists have used these AI tools to write &lt;a href="https://www.bookforum.com/culture/how-should-we-review-a-book-cowritten-by-ai-24444"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750337/shadow-planet-ai-robin-sloan-jesse-solomon-clark"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, and Sadowski says a machine’s perspective could be useful for academics who’ve burrowed too deep in their subject. “It can give you artificial distance from a thing you’ve spent a lot of time really close to, that way you can maybe see it in a different light,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMtYcH"&gt;In this way, AI systems like tl;dr papers might even find a place similar to tools designed to promote creativity. Take, for example, “Oblique Strategies,” a deck of cards created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. It offers pithy advice to struggling artists like “ask your body” or “try faking it!” Are these words of wisdom imbued with deep intelligence? Maybe, maybe not. But their primary role is to provoke the reader into new patterns of thinking. AI could offer similar services, and indeed, some companies already sell AI creative writing assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeAOoA"&gt;Unfortunately, although tl;dr papers has had a rapturous reception among the academic world, its time in the spotlight looks limited. After going viral this weekend, the website has been labeled “under maintenance,” and the site’s creators say they have no plans to maintain it in the future. (They also mention that other tools have been built that &lt;a href="https://www.studyinternational.com/news/research-paper-summarisation-allen-institute/"&gt;perform the same task&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eqiNdp"&gt;Dani told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that tl;dr papers “was designed to be an experiment to see if we can make learning about science a little easier, more fun, and engaging.” He says: “I appreciate all of the attention the app has received and thank all of the people who have tried it out [but] given this was always intended to be an educational project, I plan to sunset tl;dr papers in the coming days to focus on exploring new things.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service grows to 25 million subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox X in a circle logo against a dark background with green lines." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqoyovY6ildt09o5kdWoBqMzWu0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403392/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dQf2LQ"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/18/welcoming-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-gaming/"&gt;now has 25 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. That’s up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;18 million&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft previously reported in January last year. The Xbox Game Pass all-you-can-eat catalog of downloadable games — or the “Netflix for video games” as it’s often described — continues to attract new subscribers as Microsoft looks to extend the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD40Dc"&gt;As Microsoft’s subscriber numbers grow, so does the amount of titles available on Xbox Game Pass. In 2021, Xbox Game Pass added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;iconic Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt;, with 20 in total on the service, including &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnYwXZ"&gt;Microsoft announced the milestone while revealing its planned $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which will have Activision CEO Bobby Kotick and its 10,000 employees reporting to Phil Spencer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geCOEE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5zc14j"&gt;The acquisition also bolsters Microsoft’s Game Pass portfolio with plans to launch Activision Blizzard games into Game Pass, which has reached a new milestone of over 25 million subscribers. With Activision Blizzard’s nearly 400 million monthly active players in 190 countries and three billion-dollar franchises, this acquisition will make Game Pass one of the most compelling and diverse lineups of gaming content in the industry. Upon close, Microsoft will have 30 internal game development studios, along with additional publishing and esports production capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b08X7q"&gt;Spencer said in a blog post that “we will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard’s incredible catalog.” There are no specifics, but with the &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; brands to choose from — to name a few — the service will have a lot of options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GTG23"&gt;Microsoft has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311265/xbox-game-pass-nba-2k21-madden-nfl-21-nhl-21-ea-pass"&gt;chasing sports fans&lt;/a&gt; over the past year with the addition of &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NHL 21&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;also debuted on Xbox Game Pass last year, and Microsoft added &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; to the service over the summer. Microsoft also had a big Xbox Game Pass holiday, with &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires IV, Forza Horizon 5, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;launching day one on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7hjpy"&gt;Microsoft has also been working on extending where Xbox Game Pass is available, thanks to Xbox Game Streaming. A web version of Xbox Cloud Gaming (formerly Project xCloud) was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;made widely available&lt;/a&gt; to players on iOS and PC last summer, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787396/xbox-cloud-gaming-consoles-series-x-s-one"&gt;Microsoft started rolling the service out to Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; in November. This will allow newer games, like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, to be streamed and played on older Xbox consoles, too, as the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;fully powered by Xbox Series X hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 SE laptops arrive to take on Chromebooks in schools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eU7gGk1OCYeFGMW2RPR8tL33Jnw=/0x200:4800x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403262/WIN22_Hybrid_Learning_11SE_008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tNJqHL"&gt;Microsoft’s Chrome OS competitor, Windows 11 SE, is making its way onto a handful of laptops. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771742/microsoft-windows-11-se-features-release-date"&gt;detailing Windows 11 SE in November&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s OEM partners are now starting to make devices available globally for schools and students. Acer, Asus, Dell, Dynabook, Lenovo, HP, and JP.IK have all created Windows 11 SE laptops, with devices from Fujitsu and Positivo arriving later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8sSuu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771742/microsoft-windows-11-se-features-release-date"&gt;Windows 11 SE&lt;/a&gt; will only be available on new low-cost devices and only for schools and education customers. It’s designed to really take on Chromebooks in education, and is optimized for Microsoft Edge, Office, and Microsoft’s cloud-based services. Windows 11 SE isn’t limited to just Microsoft apps though, with both Zoom and Chrome part of an authorized selection of apps that IT admins can install. Microsoft has also simplified Windows 11 SE so apps always run fullscreen, multitasking using Snap Layouts has been reduced to side-by-side only, and the Widgets section has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Windows 11 SE laptop includes stylus support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7waCdx"&gt;In terms of hardware, a variety of laptops will be available in the coming weeks. Most OEMs seem to be repurposing existing low-cost devices to ship with Windows 11 SE preinstalled. Acer is updating its existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acer.com%2Fac%2Fen%2FUS%2Fcontent%2Fprofessional-series%2Ftravelmatespinb3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22889184%2Fwindows-11-se-laptops-acer-asus-dell-hp-lenovo-education-schools" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TravelMate Spin B3 laptop&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 SE. The 11.6-inch device includes shock-absorbent bumpers to protect against drops and even drainage nearly the keyboard for spillages. Intel Pentium Silver or Celeron processors will power the TravelMate Spin B3, which are fairly common processor choices among Windows 11 SE laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQuIc2"&gt;Asus has its own wonderfully named &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FLaptops%2FFor-Students%2FAll-series%2FASUS-BR1100F%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F18%2F22889184%2Fwindows-11-se-laptops-acer-asus-dell-hp-lenovo-education-schools" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BR1100F laptop&lt;/a&gt; that includes a 360-degree hinge, a touchscreen display with stylus support, and a rubber bumper and spill-resistant keyboard. Dell has opted for an 11-inch display on its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-3120-education/spd/latitude-11-3120-2-in-1-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Latitude 3120 laptops&lt;/a&gt;, with a quick charging feature that lets owners get around 80 percent charge in an hour. That’s useful in schools where trying to keep devices charged is half the struggle with laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbXnYl"&gt;Dynabook (known previously as Toshiba) is shipping Windows 11 SE on its existing &lt;a href="https://us.dynabook.com/computers-tablets/laptops/e-series/e10"&gt;E10 laptop series&lt;/a&gt;, with an 11.6-inch HD display, Intel Celeron processors, and solid stage storage. The keyboard is spill-resistant and this compact laptop is designed to easily fit inside backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HP has one of the only larger Windows 11 SE laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r2mqAJ"&gt;HP’s new ProBook Fortis 14-inch G9 Notebook is one of the only Windows 11 SE laptops with a larger display. The 14-inch device includes an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, and 128GB SSD. HP also has a smaller 11-inch Pro x360 model that’s powered by Windows 11 SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3xEA0"&gt;JP IK’s Windows 11 SE laptop starts at just $219. The Leap T304 has an 11.6-inch (1366 x 768) display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, and even a rotatable 2-megapixel webcam. Lenovo is also repurposing its &lt;a href="https://techtoday.lenovo.com/gb/en/solutions/education"&gt;existing 100w, 300w, 500w, and 14w laptops&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxWodE"&gt;“Our partners are building a broad portfolio of Windows 11 SE devices that are now starting to become available globally,” says Nicole Dezen, corporate vice president of device partner sales at Microsoft. “There are many more Windows 11 SE devices coming this year, including releases from Fujitsu and Positivo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDJzek"&gt;Microsoft has also created its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771778/microsoft-surface-laptop-se-features-price-release-date"&gt;$249 Surface Laptop SE&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first true Chromebook competitor. The Surface Laptop SE will be sold exclusively to schools and students when it’s available early this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Women who drive for Uber and Lyft are being left to fend for themselves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggIOOUw9yklvR_t-_SPylwjsHGE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70403313/VRG_ILLO_4949_K_Radtke_Rideshare_Assault.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Two dozen women drivers speak out about their experiences with sexual assault and harassment &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6KUOVp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this story contains descriptions of sexual assault that some readers may find disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPu2NO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For this story, last names have been omitted to protect the identities of these women and in some cases, the names have been changed for privacy reasons. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Kg44WC"&gt;Tara, a former elementary school English teacher who lives in Charleston, South Carolina, had been driving for Uber for about two years when she had her first distressing experience with a customer. Late one night, several years ago, she picked up a male passenger outside of a bar. A few minutes into the ride, the man suddenly unzipped his pants and exposed himself to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e0YnO"&gt;Tara said that she reported the passenger to Uber. The rideshare company assured her that she would not be paired with that rider again, but said nothing about his ability to use the app in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6DLKc"&gt;Several months later, Tara was outside the same bar in Charleston, waiting for a surge in requests with some other female drivers. They were talking, and she told them what had happened. To her surprise, both women told her that they had recently picked up the same passenger, weeks after Tara said she had reported him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OB4r18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;both women told her that they had recently picked up the same passenger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hPR563"&gt;Tara’s story is not uncommon. In interviews with over 25 female rideshare drivers across the country, their experiences vary, from having passengers flirt with them, solicit them for sex, or making unwanted advances toward them. Many said they have taken to carrying pepper spray or other defensive weapons in their vehicles in defiance of the app company’s policies banning such items. All of the drivers said that they do not feel completely protected or supported by the companies on whose platforms they conduct their business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sDXCO"&gt;“It just feels like they don’t care about our safety,” said one driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xUCOqqK11ot7THdi-ObpAtpTHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163563/Uber_Assault_line_break__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vj93KJ"&gt;Earlier this year,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740609/lyft-safety-report-2017-2019-physical-sexual-assault-death"&gt; Lyft released its first-ever safety reports&lt;/a&gt;d, which revealed&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740609/lyft-safety-report-2017-2019-physical-sexual-assault-death"&gt; 4,000 sexual assault claims&lt;/a&gt; from 2017–2019. Similarly, in 2019,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20997939/uber-safety-report-2018-sexual-assault-ride-hailing-platform-stats"&gt; Uber released its safety report&lt;/a&gt;, which showed just over 3,000 sexual assault claims from 2017–2018. (Uber hasn’t released an update in three years.) Around half of these claims &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/7/20998646/uber-safety-report-sexual-assault-lyft-cases"&gt;came from drivers&lt;/a&gt;, who alleged that they were victims of sexual assault from their passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0zHb3"&gt;Over the last few years, most of the attention has been on passenger safety, prompting Uber and Lyft to roll out more safety measures for their customers. Both companies are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/business/lyft-sexual-assault-lawsuit.html"&gt;currently facing multiple lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-sued-for-allegedly-failing-to-prevent-womans-sexual-assault-2020-9"&gt;from female customers&lt;/a&gt; who allege Uber and Lyft have failed to protect them from rape or assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFkIG0"&gt;Currently, new drivers on both Uber and Lyft have to undergo detailed background checks before being authorized to drive. Both drivers and customers now have access to an in-app panic button that automatically contacts a 911 dispatcher and shares the caller’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocUYCl"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2020/08/07/uber-mandatory-sexual-misconduct-assault-driver-training-u-s-canada/"&gt;Uber announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to require all new drivers in the US and Canada to complete sexual assault and misconduct training as a part of the companies’ partnership with RAINN, a national anti-sexual assault organization — a big step in regards to passenger safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcZqxH"&gt;But many drivers say these efforts still aren’t enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7T3uI"&gt;“They don’t do enough when a driver is assaulted,” said Michelle Dottin, a driver and advocate. “Safety, in general, should be for everyone. It shouldn’t be one-sided, and the way that these companies do it, it feels more one-sided — they don’t really worry as much about their drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mFgUiz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Safety, in general, should be for everyone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnIAh"&gt;In 2019,&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pregnant-lyft-driver-arizona-stabbed-death-passenger-police-say-n963766"&gt; a pregnant Lyft driver in Arizona, 39-year-old Kristina Howato, was fatally stabbed by a passenger,&lt;/a&gt; reigniting conversations regarding driver safety. But two years later, many female drivers say that they don’t feel that much safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5wHhB"&gt;Passengers are not currently required to complete background checks or sexual misconduct training before making an account. Despite making it safer for drivers, enforcing these additional measures could slow down the sign-up process, which rideshare companies tout as a central, seamless feature of their service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys6T2D"&gt;As it stands, there is no identity verification needed for passengers unless they are paying with a gift card or prepaid card. Riders can technically still use fake names or their friend’s accounts, making them harder to identify and track down if a report is made against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xwULZ"&gt;Rideshare drivers are legally classified as independent contractors, so they lack the protections available to regular employees. Everything from company-provided equipment such as dashboard cameras to the right to collective bargaining for better working conditions is denied to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hCsmc"&gt;Many drivers appreciate the freedom and flexibility that contract work allows but become frustrated when they feel unsupported by the companies — especially when it comes to safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFPoXSnZAhaxFHbGz8xzpUEQiUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163562/Uber_Assault_line_break.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EMQ06"&gt;A few months after the first incident occurred, Tara recalls driving a group of drunk men back to a golf resort in Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwRhHP"&gt;After making several stops, she had one man left to drop off. He was sitting in the front seat, she remembered, still intoxicated and still flirting with her, as he had been for the entire ride. He noticed that Tara was reading Stephen King’s “It,” which was placed on the dashboard. She was on page 262.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8y6y19"&gt;“You must be smart if you’re reading Stephen King,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcTK2o"&gt;Tara ignored him and drove cautiously to his destination. She waited for him to get out of the car. But then, according to Tara, the man began making advances towards her. She resisted. He grabbed her keys from the ignition. She honked the car horn, hoping that someone would hear, and as she reached for the car door, he slapped her hand. Tara froze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKFVTc"&gt;Out of nowhere, the passenger’s friends reappeared and took him back to the hotel. After they were gone, Tara remembers sobbing in her car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SGBFfH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He was very drunk, so I was lucky”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6pNP5"&gt;“He was very drunk, so I was lucky. If he hadn’t been as drunk, he would have raped me,” she said, thinking back to that night. “He made me feel weak; I still feel weak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28c6FS"&gt;Tara said that she never reported it to Uber or the local police. She had made several reports against passengers in the past but contends that she was left disappointed by the lack of action from both Uber and local law enforcement. She assumed that reporting this incident would again amount to nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yj3SNW"&gt;Tara says that she has an audio recording of the incident but has never given it to law enforcement or Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2zhyV"&gt;To this day, the bookmark in Stephen King’s “It” is still on page 262. After what happened, she couldn’t bring herself to finish the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFPoXSnZAhaxFHbGz8xzpUEQiUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163562/Uber_Assault_line_break.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RdAsOK"&gt;One of the realities of gig work is the trade-off between flexibility and protection. Many female drivers are mothers and value the ability to set their own schedules. But they say that the lack of safety measures limits the flexibility that drew them to the work in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GPSdU"&gt;Choosing whether or not to drive at night is a decision that many female drivers face. The demand is higher at night, so they can make more money, but they are more likely to encounter inappropriate or threatening passengers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZLeYf"&gt;Around 21 percent of &lt;a href="https://gridwise.io/who-are-rideshare-drivers-a-demographic-breakdown-of-rideshare-drivers-in-the-u-s"&gt;Lyft drivers&lt;/a&gt; and 27 percent of &lt;a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/UberPayGap.pdf"&gt;Uber drivers&lt;/a&gt; in the US are women. Nearly half of the women interviewed for this story said that they do not drive at night for safety reasons. But for some, driving at night is essential in order to make a living as there is more money to be made, and many drivers interviewed also have day jobs, so they are only able to drive at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxpfQP"&gt;“There are also women who only pick up at the airports or in certain neighborhoods,” said Moira Muntz, spokesperson for the Independent Drivers Guild, a driver-led advocacy group. “But that limits their income, as they spend a lot more time waiting between pickups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fauqWm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nearly half of the women said that they do not drive at night &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Mn8Wg"&gt;The Independent Drivers Guild is currently advocating for more passenger verification, background checks, and subsidized in-vehicle cameras, among other measures focused on making conditions safer for drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNOPWi"&gt;Susan, 58, is a Lyft driver in Houston, Texas. She mainly drives at night as there is less traffic and higher demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7P7Ay"&gt;Around two years ago, Susan said that she picked up a male passenger from a club in Houston. During the ride, she claims that he propositioned her for sex and kept offering her money for sexual favors. She declined multiple times and drove a little faster to the destination. They were right around the corner from his house, so the incident did not escalate further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFNsxy"&gt;Susan said that she reported this passenger, and though she could not locate a copy of the two-year-old report, she remembers receiving a message from Lyft saying that they had unpaired her with this passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwaLrJ"&gt;“All they say is, ‘Oh, sorry that this happened to you, we’ll make sure you never get a ride with him again. And we’ll investigate this.’ But we never know what’s gonna happen because they don’t ever tell us,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0rZ4ME"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He had a different name this time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FrBV13"&gt;Earlier this year, two years after she originally picked up that passenger, Susan said that she accepted a ride and was driving to the passenger’s pick-up point when she received a message from the rider. She recalled that the message said that he did not need a ride after all but that instead, he began offering her money for sexual favors. Susan looked at the address again and realized that it was the same man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDcd7K"&gt;“He had a different name this time. But when I drove up, I remembered the address right where I dropped him off,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG79K9"&gt;Susan said that she immediately canceled the ride. She continues to be frustrated at how the passenger had been able to make a new account with a different name despite having been reported in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITcGRA"&gt;“He is probably still out there doing the same thing,” said Susan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xUCOqqK11ot7THdi-ObpAtpTHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163563/Uber_Assault_line_break__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oy92v7"&gt;Some female drivers take it upon themselves to find ways to pre-empt passengers from doing anything inappropriate or unsafe. The tactics range from putting music on to avoid conversation to forgoing makeup and wearing baggy clothes so they don’t come across as “too attractive.” Several drivers even wear fake wedding rings and tell their passengers that their partners work in law enforcement, even if it’s untrue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wECFGE"&gt;“Men will always respect other men more than women,” said one driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLsDiu"&gt;Dashboard cameras are another tool that can help a driver feel safer. But these can cost anywhere from $100–$400, often more than a day’s income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5WOpWD"&gt;“When a rider sees a dashcam, their behavior changes, it makes a difference,” said driver advocate Michelle Dottin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqlgTu"&gt;Many women admitted to carrying some type of weapon in their cars for protection, from pepper spray and wasp spray to tasers and knives — often going against company policy, such as Lyft’s “No Weapons” policy. Uber has a similar policy, their website states that riders and drivers are “prohibited from carrying firearms or weapons of any kind (e.g., knives, tasers) while using the Uber apps, to the extent permitted by applicable law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntM1aJ"&gt;Most of the women admitted to never having used the weapons they carry but explained that having them easily accessible is important when it comes to safety, especially considering the lack of screening for riders. For several drivers, the risk of being deactivated is overshadowed by the importance of protecting themselves from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aGaQu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I just turn on the taser real quick, and that pretty much calms them down”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9R026W"&gt;A driver from Houston, Texas, admitted that in the past, she has brandished a taser when dealing with male passengers who have persisted in making her feel uncomfortable, even after declining their advances multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXe0Jv"&gt;“I just turn on the taser real quick, and that pretty much calms them down,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giGBZ8"&gt;Others rely on significant others or family members who track them on their phones, which makes many drivers feel more protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdKd68"&gt;Uber and Lyft have long defended their safety measures with regard to their drivers and passengers. When approached for comment, Jodi Kawada Page, a spokesperson from Uber said that they are committed to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxDBJ3"&gt;“We remain steadfast in our commitment to safety,” said Page in an email. “We have pioneered new safety features, processes, and policies guided by experts and gender-based violence prevention advocates.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlrGWK"&gt;Page went on to highlight many new features and policies that Uber has implemented in the last few years that are focused on passenger and driver safety. These include but are not limited to having launched a 24-7 dedicated survivor support hotline, an in-app emergency 911 button as well as educational videos, developed with RAINN, which are sent to riders and drivers when they receive a report of inappropriate behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erNP88"&gt;The spokesperson explained that Uber has recently implemented a system that prevents people who have been previously deactivated from making a new account by flagging fraud indicators such as similar data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iBglZf"&gt;Last year, Uber announced their new rider verification system that asks some passengers for an extra level of verification. This feature only applies to passengers using anonymous forms of payment such as Venmo or a gift card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFPoXSnZAhaxFHbGz8xzpUEQiUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163562/Uber_Assault_line_break.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBH82s"&gt;Whatever their hours, rideshare driving can be a lonely profession, and lots of drivers gather in Facebook groups to get advice, share stories, and meet others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sB5OuC"&gt;Allison, a Lyft driver in Austin, Texas, shared in one of the female-only drivers’ Facebook groups in November of 2021 that she had reported a passenger for making unwanted advances towards her. She explained that Lyft had emailed her and told her they had dealt with the passenger. But then, later that week, she said that they sent her another email saying they could not find the ride in question, leaving her unsure if she would pick him up again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWpR7s"&gt;She then said that she followed up with Lyft and provided them with additional information regarding the incident, but said that she never heard back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iRl7DG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are so vulnerable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXtWIO"&gt;“We are so vulnerable,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PK502f"&gt;Ashley Adams, a spokesperson from Lyft, said that safety is fundamental to their company and that they are constantly designing features and policies in an attempt to help make every Lyft ride safe. In the email, the spokesperson pointed to features such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634087/lyft-panic-button-911-app-riders-safety"&gt;in-app emergency help button &lt;/a&gt;as well as their 24/7 safety support line. (Both of these features have been well received by drivers across the country.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOMjLn"&gt;“While we do unpair riders and drivers who rate each other 3 stars or fewer, when we receive safety reports it is our policy to take additional action, which can include investigating internally, gathering additional information from riders and drivers, and deactivating the accounts used,” said Adams in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kI7f4E"&gt;In certain markets, Lyft said that they are working on ways to identify and take action against new and existing rider accounts that they determine to be high-risk. These include temporarily and permanently deactivating accounts, blocking users from creating new accounts, and requiring riders to submit additional information before requesting a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuAI5x"&gt;“Violence and harassment are not tolerated on the Lyft platform, and accounts of drivers or riders who engage in such behavior or otherwise violate our Community Guidelines are permanently removed from the platform,” Adams said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7xUCOqqK11ot7THdi-ObpAtpTHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163563/Uber_Assault_line_break__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PC2Rac"&gt;A few years ago, Tara created a local Facebook group for Myrtle Beach and Charleston drivers. Through it, she met Cathy, a 60-year-old former special education teacher, who was driving in the same area. They quickly became friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1S6bT0"&gt;Tara and Cathy began keeping an eye on each other throughout their rides. At the end of each work night, they would meet at a Walmart parking lot in Charleston to take naps before heading back to Myrtle Beach, about two hours away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4RJTEn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We had each other”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3E5up"&gt;“We had each other. If I were gone too long, she would call to ensure I was okay,” Tara explained. “And, you know, same for me if I didn’t hear from her for a while, I would call her and make sure everything was going okay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXpkRF"&gt;They both stopped driving full-time recently but occasionally still take the wheel on busy days like Thanksgiving. They are still friends. Both Tara and Cathy hope that Uber and Lyft start doing a better job protecting their drivers, holding their passengers accountable, and getting better at responding to sensitive incidents, including sexual assault and harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10QdTW"&gt;Looking back, Tara said that she wished that she’d had Cathy during her first few years on the job but is grateful for the years that they were able to support each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="W8ICQC"&gt;“We were just two women from the same city who had to create a buddy system and keep track of each other to make sure we were safe,” she said. “We supported each other when Uber didn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vLhi0fC7du_N2HBXm1IjmOHK8g=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70402797/activisionmicrosoft.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ScZIsQ"&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Activision, the troubled publisher of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;. The deal will value Activision at $68.7 billion, far in excess of the $26 billion Microsoft paid to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13882622/microsoft-linkedin-acquisition-finalized"&gt;acquire LinkedIn in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. It’s Microsoft’s biggest push into gaming, and the company says it will be the “third-largest gaming company by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony” once the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaPJb7"&gt;Microsoft plans to add many of Activision’s games to Xbox Game Pass once the deal closes. With the acquisition of Activision, Microsoft will soon publish franchises like &lt;em&gt;Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;. “Upon close, we will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard’s incredible catalog,” says Microsoft’s CEO of gaming Phil Spencer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZX6Pt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22406059/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-25-million-microsoft-activision"&gt;Xbox Game Pass now has 25 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, as Microsoft continues to acquire studios to boost the subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTPGfP"&gt;“We’re investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNQ6gk"&gt;Microsoft’s deal comes after months of sexual harassment claims against Activision Blizzard. Last July, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) sued Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for promoting a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” More &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"&gt;employees have come forward&lt;/a&gt; with more allegations of sexual misconduct ever since, and the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;reached an $18 million settlement with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; in September. That settlement is being appealed, and reports indicate that nearly 40 Activision Blizzard employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22887855/activision-blizzard-employees-fired-sexual-harassment-misconduct-controversy"&gt;reportedly “exited” the company since last July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Um3Oer0FpTlm4MRSeckHuaOGIeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23176546/GLT_OrgChart.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new gaming org chart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U7neYQ"&gt;Microsoft doesn’t detail exactly how it will approach solving these issues, and the company says Bobby Kotick will continue to serve as CEO of Activision Blizzard for now. It looks like Kotick won’t remain once the deal is fully closed and after the transition period to Microsoft, though. Spencer, formerly head of gaming at Microsoft, is now CEO of Microsoft Gaming, and the company says the Activision Blizzard business will report directly to Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttYNKr"&gt; “As a company, Microsoft is committed to our journey for inclusion in every aspect of gaming, among both employees and players,” says Spencer. “We deeply value individual studio cultures. We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mta1pm"&gt;Microsoft’s huge Activision Blizzard deal comes nearly a year after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;acquired Bethesda (ZeniMax Media) for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, that acquisition bolstered the company’s first-party Xbox game studios to a total of 23 and was seen as a huge boost for Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COfD5C"&gt;Microsoft now expects the Activision Blizzard deal “to close in fiscal year 2023,” which means we might not see this deal approved for up to 18 months. That’s a long period of time for a deal to close, but Activision Blizzard operates in a number of markets, which could make regulatory approval more complicated for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdDkPN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 18th 9:20AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with comment from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
