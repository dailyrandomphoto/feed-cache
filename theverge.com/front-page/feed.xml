    <title>Maingear Element Lite review: the competition is too good</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Intel’s cookie-cutter laptop is behind the competition while costing more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HUwXCz"&gt;The Element Lite is not the kind of laptop that Maingear usually makes. Compared to its fleet of game-ready laptops, this one stands out with a sleek, minimalist, and thin aluminum-clad design. It’s the only machine in Maingear’s current lineup of laptops that doesn’t have a dedicated graphics chip. Unsurprisingly, it’s lacking in the gaming department by comparison, but it’s practically bursting with other niceties you’d usually find in other high-end productivity laptops, like a Windows Hello IR webcam, Thunderbolt 4, USB-C charging, long battery life, and a touchscreen. Its speakers are good, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adRdCk"&gt;This out-of-left-field laptop is actually Intel’s NUC M15 design with a Maingear logo slapped on it. In case the name isn’t ringing a bell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;my colleague Dan Seifert got a first look last year at this reference laptop&lt;/a&gt; designed by Intel. It was created to help level the playing field for smaller OEMs that can’t usually compete in the ultrabook space against leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Microsoft, while also showcasing the latest tech and features from Intel. This isn’t the first time that Maingear has co-opted an Intel white label laptop, either; &lt;a href="https://maingear.com/element/"&gt;Maingear’s Element&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s spin on the previous NUC model that was more gaming-focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXd3Eq"&gt;Maingear isn’t the only company getting a NUC M15 to call its own. Brands like &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745473784129018545" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adata&lt;/a&gt;, Eluktronics, ByteSpeed, and Simply NUC are each selling their own take, and naming their own price (though only Adata and Maingear are listing products for sale currently). Maingear officially set the starting price for the Element Lite at $1,399, but at the time of publishing, it only offered models starting at $1,649 with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM and going up from there. The model that I tested has 2TB of NVMe storage and 16GB of RAM, costing $1,849. The Adata laptop I mentioned earlier is priced at a much more reasonable $1,699 and has 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pl1XzRpmL_X5b75xGv4HUoklWNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677699/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Element Lite doesn’t look like Maingear’s other laptops — in a good way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhjEqiv2pX4vmOIgF26Pgq022-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677702/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key layout is good, but they’re more spaced out than I’m used to with other laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ7shZ"&gt;The Element Lite is a good productivity laptop in terms of specs, but it lags behind the competition in some key ways. Its 16:9 aspect ratio display feels cramped, and its keys are spaced a little too far apart. It’s also too expensive. A sale or discount could help, but even then it’s tough to recommend over a handful of laptops that have equally capable (or better) specs or more appealing features combined with a lower price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R0Jrex"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10641439"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEG5HA"&gt;Apple’s 13-inch Macbook Pro with an M1 processor has a more compact chassis, and it rivals the power of Maingear’s machine for $150 less (or $350 less if you want to settle for 8GB of RAM instead of 16GB). If you want to stick with Windows 10, Microsoft’s 15-inch Surface Laptop 4 has a higher-res display, a sleeker design, and a superior keyboard. You can also find this model with similar specs for about $150 less than Maingear’s offering. Both of these models also have displays with a more generous aspect ratio than the Element Lite, which is a boon for productivity work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOTVzK"&gt;As I mentioned, the Element Lite has an identical set of features &lt;a href="http://intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/205490/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-kit-lapbc710/specifications.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and components&lt;/a&gt; to other NUC M15 variants, like a glossy, glass-covered 15.6-inch, 1080p touchscreen with a 60Hz refresh rate and a 16:9 aspect ratio. This laptop is a showcase for Intel’s latest innovations, including an 11th-gen processor and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. It has an Intel Core i7-1165G7 quad-core processor (base clock of 2.8 GHz, boost clock of 4.7GHz), and Intel’s Iris Xe powers the graphics — all in a portable chassis weighing less than four pounds (3.64 pounds, to be precise). There are four microphones embedded into the top edge of the display enclosure, and a light underneath the trackpad will illuminate blue when you summon Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with the wake word (if you choose to install the app, otherwise it does nothing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FE8wj1BM5rvN_KQndiz4iYezXQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677695/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is what the left side of the Element Lite offers in terms of ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvidWm41je1GnASyJ2S7llFmgrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677697/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what you’ll get on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9F4o0D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10641452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sSKIQM"&gt;The all-aluminum design of the Maingear Element Lite (also found in the rest of the NUC M15 models) is very reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8375735/apple-macbook-pro-retina-review-2015" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous generations of the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Its sharp edges and rounded corners are familiar, as are the black, backlit keys that sit in a recessed section, and the silver color of the aluminum chassis. Even smaller details from that lineup are present, like an indentation that allows its easy-lift lid to open with just one finger, and a center-aligned glass trackpad. Double-tapping the trackpad’s top left corner will turn it off (a white LED lights up to indicate that it’s inactive). The keyboard has backlit keys that feel good to type on, and I have no complaints about the layout — aside from the keys feeling a little too spaced out. For a productivity laptop, I expect to hit the ground running with the basics, and the keyboard was a hurdle that led to typing errors during my first few days testing the Element Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woBAMe"&gt;The 15.6-inch display in the Element Lite claims to reach 300 nits of brightness. That’s bright enough to use in a window-filled cafe, but the glossy display means you might need to move the laptop if you’re catching too many reflections. Otherwise, the screen quality is up to par for productivity work — as much as I wish it were a more spacious 16:10 or 3:2 aspect ratio screen like you can get on Apple or Microsoft’s laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG4jmU"&gt;The Element Lite provides about as many ports as I expect for a thin and relatively lightweight laptop. Its left side hosts a Thunderbolt 4 port, HDMI out, and a USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 3 port. The right side has another Thunderbolt 4 port and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 3 port next to it, as well as a headphone jack and a Kensington lock. Conveniently, you can use either Thunderbolt 4 port to recharge the laptop, and the compact 65W power adapter comes with a long cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdYSNZiSz9a2rlWkATx9zPWB3f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677696/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This laptop has no issue staying relatively cool and quiet, despite its large air outlets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xpts0Scn35uTw9eaWVDx5fNGIKs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677701/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top bezel is loaded with infrared and proximity sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gAUba7"&gt;Battery life is one of the Element Lite’s most impressive assets, even if Maingear doesn’t list it as meeting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21408718/intel-11th-gen-tiger-lake-cpu-processor-announcement-laptops-fall" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Intel’s own Evo standard&lt;/a&gt;. During normal use at work with about 15 tabs open in Microsoft Edge, with Spotify and the one-off Zoom call mixed in, it lasted well into a second day of work, or about nine hours. I likely could have extended it a couple more hours had I just been typing and browsing, but it was tough to resist blaring music through this laptop’s speakers. They’re surprisingly good, even at loud volumes. Sound doesn’t resonate with bass here, but songs don’t have that shallow, tinny profile that you’re usually stuck with on most other thin laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JhHiC"&gt;I’m pleased with the 720p Windows Hello IR webcam, which logs me in quickly when I wake the computer from sleeping. The video quality of the webcam isn’t fantastic, but it works as intended. What I appreciated about this particular setup is its optional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18654083/dell-business-laptop-latitude-7400-express-sign-in-login-hands-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;proximity-based feature that can lock (and unlock) the computer&lt;/a&gt; if you walk away from it, or approach it. It was satisfying to use; my music on Spotify paused when it went to sleep, then the screen powered on when I walked near it and my music started playing once it unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfY80c"&gt;Now, Maingear is typically associated with gaming, but this laptop’s name, the Element Lite, is a clue that gaming isn’t a talent it’s particularly adept in. Still, the fast processor, capable integrated graphics, and fast RAM help it achieve passable gaming performance, depending on the game. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, a first-person shooter that we’ve managed to run at respectable frame rates on other machines that lack a dedicated graphics card, the Element Lite reached 60 frames per second while plugged into power and with medium graphical settings. Impressively, its fans weren’t audible with the laptop’s volume set to less than halfway. Still, I wouldn’t suggest this laptop to anyone who games on a regular basis, unless those games happen to be older games that have low system requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qOCDgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10641444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9oylE"&gt;I couldn’t help but notice that the Element Lite is a bloatware-free experience with just a few Intel applications pre-installed to get the latest drivers and to tweak the audio settings. That marks a refreshing change, as many Windows laptops (both in and outside of the realm of gaming) are usually loaded with umpteen apps that are often unnecessary — and at worst, obtrusive to the experience. To the credit of Intel’s vision, few Windows laptops can compete with the Element Lite’s bloatware-free user experience, and that helps this laptop feel as much like a reference Windows device, as it is a reference 15.6-inch thin laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFVqG4"&gt;If you’re interested in the Element Lite, that means your interest is piqued in the NUC M15 generally. To that end, I suggest that you find the best deal — regardless of whose brand is lasered onto the lid. As for how much storage you get built-in, don’t sweat it too much. The RAM is soldered onto the board, but you can add your own NVMe M.2 SSD by opening up the bottom, which is a great perk for such a thin laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Maingear Element Lite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mbwSiWuOXWHWf4z8EJyc9YoK-zk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677700/cfaulkner_210623_4647_0005.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This laptop will blend in nicely at a cafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDwCUE"&gt;The Element Lite is a well-rounded machine, but the competition is too tough for this kind of laptop to stand out — even if you’re able to wiggle the price down a bit. In addition to the MacBook Pro with the M1 processor, or the Surface Laptop 4 that I mentioned above, you’ll likely be better served by other productivity-focused models like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s Gram 17&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419899/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro 360&lt;/a&gt;, which cost less than Maingear’s Element Lite and offer better specs or nicer displays. With the options above, you can find one with a higher resolution screen, one with an OLED screen, a more generous screen aspect ratio, or just more versatility with a 2-in-1 design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9mJOAP"&gt;Intel didn’t need to pack in all of those features to push back against the competition. Going with a taller aspect ratio and dropping the price might have been enough to change the conversation. But as it stands now, if you’re looking for a premium Windows laptop for productivity work, you’ve got plenty of better options to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet adds Duo-style filters, AR masks, and effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gP7K7sKhUnsxa0zvKwYhevt2udg=/2x0:2159x1438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555235/msedge_tKfr8feqve.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs0xIC"&gt;Google Meet is getting new video filters, effects, and augmented reality masks for personal calls on iOS and Android, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1412822085316005889"&gt;the search giant has announced&lt;/a&gt;. They’re available via the sparkle icon at the bottom right of your video feed during a call, which brings up a carousel of different effects that include color filters and animated AR face effects. Most of the options are only available for personal Gmail accounts, while Workspace users have to keep things more professional with a limited selection of blurring and virtual background options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPFL4o"&gt;The new video effects are the latest example of Meet’s shift from targeting enterprise and business users, to targeting consumers more generally after Google released Meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;free to personal Google accounts&lt;/a&gt; last year. The filters are very similar to what’s &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/duo/family-mode/"&gt;already been available&lt;/a&gt; for Google’s consumer-focused Duo video chat service, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/08/14/sources-google-meet-replaces-duo/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the company plans to eventually replace Duo with Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fNnvWd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Add cats, astronauts, jellyfish and more to your Meet calls. New filters, masks and effects are now available for Meet on Android and iOS. Try it today → &lt;a href="https://t.co/DDSvWFxDG8"&gt;https://t.co/DDSvWFxDG8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hylhsCcUuj"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hylhsCcUuj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1412822085316005889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="mdhb8f"&gt;If trying to make sense of all of Google’s messaging products is making your head hurt then don’t worry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline"&gt;you’re not alone&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, we might soon have one less Google service to keep track of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s Pocket 2 4K vlogger cam now comes in white</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DQyp08VU3wK8OMHCKapAwafFPs=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69555206/203213365c1a2725c963a07e84f8b654_ultra.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DJI’s Pocket 2, now in white.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PJUfC"&gt;DJI’s latest handheld stabilized vlogging camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;the Pocket 2&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fae%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fdji-pocket-2-sunset-white&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568152%2Fdji-pocket-2-white-vlogger-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now available in white&lt;/a&gt;. The camera released last year only in black features a larger sensor and double the amount of microphones as its predecessor, the DJI Osmo Pocket. The new colorway follows a number of software updates DJI has made to the camera since its original release, with benefits including enhanced autofocus, support for HDR video, and better subject tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVyZAs"&gt;The white Pocket 2 is available to buy now from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.dji.com%2Fproduct%2Fpocket-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F8%2F22568152%2Fdji-pocket-2-white-vlogger-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, where it’s currently listed at $439 as part of a bundle that includes a mini control stick, cover, handle, smartphone adaptors, power cable, wrist strap, and a sling strap. And yes, everything barring the power cable also comes in white. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google feared Samsung Galaxy Store and tried to quash it, lawsuit alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiocgqEpjwa-f4hh3JsxhGzPxLc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69554979/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCnzXt"&gt;Google used anticompetitive practices in an attempt to “preemptively quash” Samsung’s Galaxy Store, and prevent it from becoming a viable competitor to its own Play Store. That’s according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;an antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed by a coalition of three dozen state attorney general, which accuses Google of illegally attempting to control app distribution on Android. The suit also alleges Google paid off app developers to stop them circumventing its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4y7Qq"&gt;The allegations challenge one of Google’s core defenses of its policies, which is that unlike Apple’s iOS rules, Android allows both competing app stores and side-loading apps directly. The lawsuit is effectively claiming that this openness is a facade, because while customers technically have the choice of where to get their apps from, Google’s business practices have prevented a viable app store competitor from emerging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ehCTd9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google felt deeply threatened when Samsung began to revamp its own app store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt8Lg9"&gt;“Google felt deeply threatened when Samsung began to revamp its own app store, the Samsung Galaxy Store,” the suit says, and describes Google’s approach to the competing store as “a threat it needed to preemptively quash.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOPlTT"&gt;The suit outlines a range of tactics Google allegedly used to prevent Samsung’s store from becoming a viable competitor. It claims Google used revenue share agreements with Android phone manufacturers that “outright prohibited” pre-installing some other app stores, and that it made “a direct attempt to pay Samsung to abandon relationships with top developers and scale back competition through the Samsung Galaxy Store.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The suit describes Google’s approach to Samsung’s store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="61r6TW"&gt;As well as attempting to nullify Samsung’s store directly, the attorneys general claim that Google worked with app developers to encourage them not to distribute their apps outside of the Play Store, effectively paying them off while imposing restrictions about how they distribute their apps. In a heavily redacted section of the filing, the AGs argue that much of Google’s response came “as a direct consequence” of Epic Games choosing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17645982/epic-games-fortnite-android-version-bypass-google-play-store"&gt;distribute &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; outside of the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. “To Google, competition in app distribution is a virus to be eliminated,” the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0bEUlpu1uaX5_8nR_sjD-8BGVzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705406/msedge_qDTaMPj732.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s response to Epic distributing Fortnite outside its app store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhLFD7"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published shortly after the suit was filed, Google’s senior director of public policy Wilson White called it “a meritless lawsuit that ignores Android’s openness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvjOA0"&gt;“If you don’t find the app you’re looking for in Google Play, you can choose to download the app from a rival app store or directly from a developer’s website. We don’t impose the same restrictions as other mobile operating systems do,” White wrote, adding that manufacturers and carriers have the option of pre-installing other app stores and that “most” Android devices ship with ”two or more app stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEk0jA"&gt;Epic Games made similar allegations that Google has attempted to quash rival app distribution methods in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368395/fortnite-epic-games-oneplus-deal-google-play-store-lawsuit-lg"&gt;lawsuit against the search giant last year&lt;/a&gt;. It claimed Google forced OnePlus to abandon a deal to preload a special &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; launcher on its phones, and that it prevented LG from pre-installing the Epic Games app on its devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus admits to throttling popular apps to save battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro (top) and OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huCXNrOJELXUlJp4vIz_9kp-KpQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69554977/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0061_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JbIu1k"&gt;OnePlus has confirmed that it deliberately reduces performance in “many of the most popular apps” in order to improve battery life on its latest OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro phones. The issue arose following &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination/"&gt;testing by &lt;em&gt;Anandtech’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Andrei Frumusanu, who called the situation “rather baffling” after discovering slowdown in a wide range of prominent apps from Google’s Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLyXdg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt;’s conclusion is that OnePlus is “blacklisting popular applications away from its fastest cores, causing slowdown in typical workloads such as web browsing.” The site tested Chrome and Twitter performance extensively, but concluded that the slowdown “applies to pretty much everything that has any level of popularity in the Play Store.” That’s said to cover all Google apps, all Microsoft Office apps, and all notable social media apps and web browsers, though some complex games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; are reportedly unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T24grs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zEHInm"&gt;Some phone manufacturers have been caught in the past &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/1/4791354/samsung-rigging-benchmark-scores-galaxy-note-3"&gt;artificially boosting performance&lt;/a&gt; so that their devices run unreasonably fast in benchmarks. That isn’t quite what’s happening here; while benchmark apps seem to be running within expectations, it’s the performance of “regular” apps that’s been reduced. Nevertheless, popular testing tool GeekBench &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geekbench/status/1412433598200823810"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; OnePlus’ approach as “benchmark manipulation” and has removed the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro from its Android benchmark chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiwDjh"&gt;OnePlus &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-9-pro-performance-throttling-popular-apps/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this is intended behavior designed to improve battery life. Here’s the full statement: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sT9NBw"&gt;“Our top priority is always delivering a great user experience with our products, based in part on acting quickly on important user feedback. Following the launch of the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro in March, some users told us about some areas where we could improve the devices’ battery life and heat management. As a result of this feedback, our R&amp;amp;D team has been working over the past few months to optimize the devices’ performance when using many of the most popular apps, including Chrome, by matching the app’s processor requirements with the most appropriate power. This has helped to provide a smooth experience while reducing power consumption. While this may impact the devices’ performance in some benchmarking apps, our focus as always is to do what we can to improve the performance of the device for our users.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jINyzh"&gt;OnePlus’ statement implies that the performance is only affected in benchmark results, which is essentially the opposite of what &lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt; has found. Unless, of course, the intended user experience is for most popular apps to be slowed down, and the “impact” is on benchmark results that are higher than they ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxXoFe"&gt;It is worth noting that the performance tweaks may well not make much difference to the user’s overall experience. “I wouldn’t blame anybody if they hadn’t necessarily noticed the performance discrepancy — I hadn’t immediately noticed it myself beyond the device’s extremely slow momentum scrolling speed setting,” Frumusanu writes. “However, having it side-by-side to a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, or a Xiaomi Mi 11 (Ultra) and paying attention, I do very much notice that the OnePlus 9 Pro is less responsive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgSmJl"&gt;What’s clear is that OnePlus is taking an unusual approach to power management on the 9 Pro — Frumusanu says it “certainly represents the first case of a vendor implementing application and benchmark detection in this manner” — and that’s something you might want to be aware of before dropping the cash on the company’s latest flagship.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This inexpensive backlight makes your big TV even more immersive</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Incredible value for money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KrV7P1"&gt;I’ve been intrigued by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/3/9257887/philips-ambilux-4k-tv-ifa-2015"&gt;Philips’ Ambilight televisions&lt;/a&gt; for almost two decades. Watching those displays bleed onto the wall in radiant synchronicity is something to behold. I just couldn't justify the price premium, despite the promise of a more immersive viewing experience. Then Philips Hue introduced an external &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221#overview" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hue Play Box&lt;/a&gt; that adds Ambilight to any TV. But at $229 and requiring you to buy lights to use with it, it was still too expensive for my cheap ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0ueHT"&gt;A few months ago, I discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Immersion TV backlight&lt;/a&gt; while checking out Govee’s new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Cutting-Edge-Technology-Fascinating-Effortless/dp/B08V8GS7PF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lyra free-standing lamp&lt;/a&gt;. The Lyra is cool, but Govee’s Immersion backlight kit seemed like the stuff of my budget-priced dreams. Together, they can transform a bland living room into a hyper-chromatic party. At $80 (and sometimes less if you find it on sale), including all of the components you need to make it work, short of a TV itself, the Govee Immersion kit offers a much better value proposition than Philips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fTsbop"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10640673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yKGyHX"&gt;Installing the Govee Immersion light kit on the back of my TV took about an hour, mostly because caution is advised when gluing over 12 feet of LED lights to a thin and expensive LG OLED TV. The Immersion light strip is a single strand of RGBIC LEDs that sit atop a layer of strong 3M adhesive. I used masking tape to stage my installation before removing the back of the 3M tape to permanently attach the LEDs around the entire perimeter of the TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uaOgF"&gt;Even then, I still had to move the left and right LED sections. It was only after turning on the lights that I realized the strips were too close to the left- and right-hand edges making them visible from the front. Fortunately, the strips peeled away easily enough, allowing me to reattach them closer to the center without needing to reheat the 3M tape with a hairdryer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv4ENF"&gt;Govee says the Immersion kit is suitable for TVs between 55 and 65 inches, with the single LED light strip divided into sections measuring 70cm for the sides and 120cm along the top and bottom. For my 55-inch TV, I had to do plenty of twisting and cajoling of the LED strip to make sure the slack looped at the corners wasn’t visible from the front. It was all a bit of trial and error while making liberal use of the adhesive cable clamps included in the kit. Installation should be easier on larger TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ZljUg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10640645"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B72Yz8"&gt;The Govee Immersion TV Backlight relies upon an external camera to synchronize the LEDs with any colors it detects on the display. Conversely, the Hue Play Box only works with content fed to it via HDMI. That’s given Govee the advantage for anyone who relies heavily on content sourced directly from apps installed on their smart TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62T4qB"&gt;Placement of the camera is crucial to the operation as it watches the edges of the display and then maps the colors back to each LED on the strip. All Govee marketing materials suggest that the camera has to sit on top of the TV. It’s only when you open the companion phone app that you learn it can also be placed at the bottom, which looks much better in my setup. My TV is sitting on a cabinet with a soundbar in front that completely hides the camera mounted below. Unfortunately, the soundbar also blocks most of the bottom strip of LEDs so I don’t get the full 360-degree Ambilight experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVfyzQ"&gt;The downside of mounting the camera at the bottom is an increase in light interference, affecting the accuracy of the Immersion backlight colors. In my setup, I have light spilling in from a nearby garden door creating some minor interference. In the image slider below, you can see how the light output of the Govee Lyra affects the Immersion backlight when turned on. Mounting the camera on top of the TV would have mostly avoided this. But for me, I’d rather turn off the light than stare at the camera all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="CfqeTc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10640593"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwLyuy"&gt;Calibrating the camera is not for the faint of heart as it requires adhering seven orange blocks to the TV display. I affixed mine as if handling live explosives, and the blocks came off without leaving any residue. But boy, did those steps feel icky. Calibrating the fish-eye camera is then a matter of using the Govee Home app to align a camera guide with the blocks. Don’t rush this step. Your diligence will be rewarded with an accurate color map that can be enjoyed long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8m4g1NJCROJOc_rN-A0qe7V5DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22705383/IMG_959EC950B2C8_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the most useful settings for Video mode, including Part or All, Game or Movie, and Brightness and Saturation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l3vtme"&gt;Govee Immersion can be controlled with the Govee Home app over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. There’s also a dedicated control module that sits in line with the LED strip on the back of the TV (using more 3M tape). The lights support Google Assistant and Alexa out of the box. I plugged mine into a smart plug (the TV’s USB port isn’t an option) that automatically turns the LEDs on and off along with the TV. It works well since the Immersion remembers the last mode it was in before powering off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeE66n"&gt;The Govee Home app is where you’re introduced to an overwhelming set of options. There are interactive modes that make the strips respond to music and video, and static modes built around your preferred color patterns and scenes. It was within the Video mode that I fulfilled my Ambilight ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fnD94"&gt;Video mode can be set to Part or All. Part makes each RGBIC LED respond locally to what’s happening on the display next to it, whereas All creates a uniform backlight of color based upon some average of what the camera sees on the display. Video mode can be further refined with a Game or Movie selection. Game mode causes the colors to change more abruptly, while Movie results in smoother but slower color transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtE2IP"&gt;After a few weeks of testing, I ultimately settled on Part / Movie video modes with brightness set to 75 percent and saturation set to about 15 percent. These settings provide the best balance of immersion versus distraction for the content I watched the most: films, television series, some animation, and lots of soccer during the UEFA Champions League competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3SoO8L"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Govee Immersion LED backlight soccer demonstration|102877" data-volume-uuid="ca6c25c63" data-volume-id="102877" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-423" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soccer looks great in Part / Movie modes, especially when England scores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cF8ffo"&gt;Soccer looked amazing in these settings, where long single-camera shots show great swaths of green grass and uniformly clad spectators. The adaptive backlighting added substantially to the immersive feel, especially in the evening hours when the Govee Immersion wasn’t competing with the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZgZ4K"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Govee Immersion quick cuts|102874" data-volume-uuid="77137662c" data-volume-id="102874" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-334" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Govee Immersion in Part / Movie mode can fall behind on content with quick cut edits. All / Movie or Part / Game modes can improve performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bhmXSe"&gt;The Part / Movie settings were less than perfect for watching films with quick-cut action shots. The split-second delay between a display change and the bias lighting detecting it proved distracting in some scenes, pulling the viewer out of the action, especially when the colors were wrong. Switching things to Game (faster response) or All (uniform backlight) settings helped improve the experience. Otherwise, I could just dim the LED brightness to make the backlight less prominent. It was never distracting enough to compel me to turn the backlight off completely, though.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immersion backlight set to All  / Movie mode makes The Handmaid’s Tale even more dire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oegPiDhSBAjMrRvuR3fQPbxWs2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703075/verge_IMG_8621_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anime, too (Part / Movie mode).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soccer looks amazing in Part / Movie mode, thanks to wide shots with few camera changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7PLAt"&gt;For television shows like &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, I preferred things in All / Movie mode and let Govee choose the uniform backlight colors. More often than not, it chose a deep angry red. How apropos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VR6Jgt"&gt;I’ve been generally pleased with the accuracy of the color mapping though it does occasionally get confused. Nevertheless, I never want to watch TV without an immersive dynamic backlight again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZ_nmVrtfN6NbQA8H-_zZ_mhp7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703105/verge_IMG_8670_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ideally, the standing Lyra lamp would sync colors with the Immersion camera for dynamic scenes like these. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Iwrhf"&gt;Ideally, the Govee Lyra would sync with the Govee Immersion to further enhance the Ambilight-like experience. While you can create Smart links within the Govee app to sync some features of the Lyra and Immersion lights, it’s limited to on / off or color syncing. They cannot sync information collected by the Immersion’s camera. That’s a shame because I’d love to transform the TV area into a makeshift &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2w-XqW7bF4&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;Microsoft IllumiRoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="iU9Yki"&gt;On its own, the Govee Lyra is neat but gimmicky. It lacks a Video mode, but otherwise includes all of the same light modes as the Immersion backlight. But none of those are very compelling unless your job is to DJ dance parties for kids. It’s hard to justify a free-standing vertical LED lightstrip that costs $149.99, when the $79.99 Immersion is such a compelling product for so much less.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polestar made a more powerful version of its electric sedan for the Goodwood Festival </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_MBYJQG38IXGnHFZDBe_0Flgoc=/0x0:6480x4320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69554875/Polestar_2_Goodwood_FOS_2021_1__3__1__1__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RgwjW0"&gt;Swedish electric performance automaker Polestar made a more powerful version of its electric fastback sedan for the Goodwood Festival of Speed in the UK, which kicks off today, July 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNBoXX"&gt;Polestar, which is jointly owned by Volvo and Volvo’s Chinese parent company Geely, has tuned the dual motor configuration to pump out 476 horsepower, compared to 408 horsepower in the production version. By doing this, it hopes that the modified Polestar 2 will be able to finish Goodwood’s hill-climbing race in record time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsykoU"&gt;The company has also widened the vehicle’s stance by 10 millimeters on both sides and lowered the ride height by 25 mm to improve its handling on the track. And it’s carried over a few features from its first vehicle, the plug-in hybrid Polestar 1, including 9x21-inch wheels, 6-piston Akebono front brakes, and 275/30R21 Pirelli PZero Rosso performance tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BLDOoB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This car is what happens when we are given freedom to go beyond our limits”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKlRex"&gt;There have been other modifications as well, including stiffer front and rear springs, upgraded dampers, and a carbon-fiber front suspension strut bar from a Volvo S60. “This car is what happens when we are given freedom to go beyond our limits,” Joakim Rydholm, Polestar’s chief chassis engineer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOA7La"&gt;Polestar cites the company’s CEO, Thomas Ingenlath, as the impetus behind the experimental EV. Ingenlath, who for several months has been driving another experimental version of the Polestar 2 nicknamed “Beast,” said he directed the engineering team to “play with Polestar 2 and come up with something that makes a strong statement for Goodwood.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3S0PN1"&gt;Polestar isn’t the first EV company to aspire to win the Goodwood Festival. The current record holder is Romain Dumas, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683330/volkswagen-idr-goodwood-record-heidfeld-video"&gt;who broke a 20-year-record in 2019&lt;/a&gt; while driving a Volkswagen ID R electric racecar. (The festival was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.) Dumas also holds the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650494/volkswagen-electric-vehicle-record-nurburgring-nio"&gt;electric vehicle record at Germany’s famous Nürburgring&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/24/17078544/volkswagen-ev-race-car-pikes-peak-hill-climb-record"&gt;fastest run up Pikes Peak&lt;/a&gt; in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MonZZC"&gt;But if Polestar wants to take the crown from the ID R, which was built explicitly to tackle these hill-climbing contests, Polestar will certainly have its work cut out for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Od07O5"&gt;There will be plenty of electric competitors this year as well. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 will be represented, and Ford CEO Jim Farley &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1382273696031707137"&gt;plans on driving the race himself&lt;/a&gt; from behind the wheel of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403756/ford-gt-performance-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-range-specs"&gt;Mustang Mach-E GT Performance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEqir8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiA4Cm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nee302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjMrve"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mozilla’s RegretsReporter data shows YouTube keeps recommending harmful videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7XOziXhEzQHdu6xJFLUDxjEmFHk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69554545/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ANS1m3"&gt;That the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16222850/youtube-google-brain-algorithm-video-recommendation-personalized-feed"&gt;machine learning-driven feed&lt;/a&gt; of YouTube recommendations can frequently surface results of an edgy or even &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html"&gt;radicalizing&lt;/a&gt; bent isn’t much of a question anymore. YouTube itself has pushed tools that it says could give users more control over their feed and transparency about certain recommendations, but it’s difficult for outsiders to know what kind of impact they’re having. Now, after spending much of the last year collecting data from the &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/"&gt;RegretsReporter extension&lt;/a&gt; (available for &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/regretsreporter/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/regretsreporter/obpoeflheeknapimliioeoefbfaakefn"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;), the Mozilla Foundation has &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-investigation-youtube-algorithm-recommends-videos-that-violate-the-platforms-very-own-policies/"&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; on what people see when the algorithm makes the wrong choice and has released &lt;a href="https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Mozilla_YouTube_Regrets_Report.pdf"&gt;a detailed report&lt;/a&gt; (pdf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jy7Iyk"&gt;In September 2020 the extension launched, taking a crowdsourced approach to find “regrettable” content that people encounter via the recommendation engine. After receiving 3,362 reports (along with data from people who installed the extension but did not submit reports), trends in the data show the danger in YouTube’s approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nWKZdm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube needs to admit their algorithm is designed in a way that harms and misinforms people.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cCeFRM"&gt;While the foundation says it kept the concept of a “regret” vague on purpose, it judged that 12.2 percent of reported videos violated YouTube’s own rules for content, and noted that about nine percent of them (nearly 200 in total) have been removed from YouTube — after accruing over 160 million views. As far as why those videos were posted in the first place, a possible explanation is that they’re popular — Mozilla noted that reported videos averaged 70 percent more views per day than other videos watched by volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVSeMP"&gt;Mozilla senior director of advocacy Brandy Guerkink &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-investigation-youtube-algorithm-recommends-videos-that-violate-the-platforms-very-own-policies/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “YouTube needs to admit their algorithm is designed in a way that harms and misinforms people.” Still, two stats in particular jumped out to me from the study: Mozilla says “in 43.3 percent of cases where we have data about trails a volunteer watched before a Regret, the recommendation was completely unrelated to the previous videos that the volunteer watched.” Also, the rate of regrettable videos reported was 60 percent higher in countries where English is not a primary language. Despite the small sample size and possible selection bias of the data, it indicates there’s more to look at in places where people who primarily speak English aren’t even paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOMTFG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtubes-recommendations-still-push-harmful-videos-crowdsourced-study-rcna1355"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; included a statement from YouTube regarding the report that claimed “over the past year alone, we’ve launched over 30 different changes to reduce recommendations of harmful content.” They had a similar response &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21436240/mozilla-browser-extension-youtube-crowdsource-recommendation-algorithm"&gt;when the project launched last year&lt;/a&gt;. Reforms suggested by Mozilla include transparency reports and the ability to opt-out of personalization, but with YouTube pulling in over $6 billion per quarter from advertising, pulling away from profiling seems doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdYSdZloacI-EBnDj-JyS7sH6Bk=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553722/choetech.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MtCLY9"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new charger or cable, you might find fewer brands on Amazon than you’d expect — because at least six of them have mysteriously disappeared. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;giant retailer confirmed last month&lt;/a&gt; that it had removed Aukey, Mpow, RavPower, Vava and TaoTronics, but now a sixth gadget maker has similarly vanished in a puff of smoke: Choetech, a company perhaps best known for inexpensive wireless charging pads. (A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers have them sitting around right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RopcYq"&gt;Amazon isn’t talking this time, but the modus operandi is the same: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Choetech/Choetech/page/AAB8B7E6-B653-46D8-8CC7-702A6FCA805D"&gt;if you visit Choetech’s seller page on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see the same telltale empty boxes where the company’s products used to be. Searches for Choetech only surface products from other sellers instead (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/choetech-delisted-on-amazon-for-alleged-fake-reviews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;xda-developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). As far as I can tell, the store was removed several days ago, with reports on social media of its disappearance dating back to July 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7mV6nGtZjAB6ox_AXMVQPudX4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704510/choetech_blank_spaces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choetech’s seller page on Amazon has holes where products used to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nqcRgP"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine why this might have happened. Amazon’s in the middle of a crackdown on fake five-star reviews, and quite a few gadget sellers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339"&gt;have been caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; trying to pay customers to inflate their score. (Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned incentivized reviews &lt;/a&gt;in 2016.) When we asked about Choetech, Amazon would only point us &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;to its June 16th blog post&lt;/a&gt; that discusses the new crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JoJoU"&gt;Choetech, aka Shenzhen Dak Technology, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YZU2Ke"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow are suddenly, suspiciously disappearing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"},{"title":"Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"},{"title":"Not just RavPower — Amazon has yanked Vava and TaoTronics, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DzNjhj"&gt;We also haven’t gotten comment back from any of the earlier gadget brands that Amazon did confirm removing — but it seems like some of them may be trying to dodge the ban with slightly different seller names. While Aukey and Mpow no longer have a direct presence on Amazon, you can still find &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Key+Series&amp;amp;ref=bl_dp_s_web_0"&gt;some of Aukey’s wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; under the “Key Series” brand there, and Amazon is also currently selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-xMpow-Bluetooth-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B0924DCSYS"&gt;the “xMpow MFly&lt;/a&gt;,” which appears to be an Mpow product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2OzVU"&gt;If you’ve received any inserts in your Amazon packages, suspicious or no, electronics or no, can you send me pictures at sean@theverge.com? I’m collecting them for a future story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SYAzKw"&gt;

    <title>Dota 2’s The International will now take place in Bucharest in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ESPORTS-GAMING-INTERNET" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOQ7VM9IsMCkIXmKoH_jyVLwM78=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553614/1163941109.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDl0RB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s prestigious The International tournament will now be taking place in Bucharest, Romania in October, &lt;a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/2968417243145568913"&gt;Valve announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The event had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432042/dota-2-international-esports-tournament-stockholm-date"&gt;originally set&lt;/a&gt; to take place in Stockholm, Sweden in August, but Valve had announced in June it had started looking for other locations because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545319/dota-2-the-international-valve-sweden-europe"&gt;restrictions on esports events in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbYqYY"&gt;The rescheduled event, which will be hosted in Bucharest’s Areana Nationala, will kick off on October 7th, with the Group Stage running through October 10th. Main Stage events start on October 12th, and the final match taking place on October 17th. Players will be competing for an eye-poppingly large prize pool of more than $40 million. Tickets aren’t on sale yet, but information about that “will come shortly,” Valve says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g19IJe"&gt;The October event marks The International’s return after a one-year hiatus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21175145/the-international-2020-valve-dota-2-coronavirus-delay"&gt;due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. But Valve wasn’t the only company with big news about an esports event on Wednesday; the Call of Duty League announced that its championship weekend, which will be an in-person event at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California, will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CODLeague/status/1412818756536000512"&gt;take place starting August 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
