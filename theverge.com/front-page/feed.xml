    <title>NASA delays moon lander awards as Biden team mulls moonshot program</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KnlpoH"&gt;NASA last week quietly delayed its plan to award two high-profile crewed lunar lander contracts, moving the finish line back two months for a crucial program under the Trump administration’s hasty timeline to get astronauts on the moon in 2024. With short funding from Congress and a new administration focused on more pressing national issues, the move was expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsbVhy"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX, a team of aerospace giants led by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Leidos-owned Dynetics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242837/nasa-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-human-lunar-landers#:~:text=NASA%20has%20chosen%20SpaceX%2C%20Blue,man%20to%20the%20lunar%20surface."&gt;won a combined $967 million&lt;/a&gt; in seed funding from NASA last year to develop rivaling concepts for a human lunar landing system. It’s the space agency’s first effort to spend money on astronaut moon landers since the Apollo program in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77SFvt"&gt;Last Wednesday, NASA told the three contractors that an extension to their development contracts “will be required,” picking a new award date of April 30th. Under the Trump administration’s timeline, the agency had planned to pick two of the three bidders in late February, giving a stamp of approval for two systems that would inevitably carry humans to the moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIFwUR"&gt;The delay was all but certain: The spending bill Congress passed in December gives NASA $850 million for the Human Landing System program, far short of the $3.2 billion it needed to stick with the 2024 timeline. But NASA remained committed to the February award date and, similarly, the 2024 moonshot. A delay was also expected as Biden’s team holds off on releasing any space policy and focuses more on climate change and curbing the pandemic, keeping the long-term fate of NASA’s Artemis program uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UZx9I5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Delay gives companies more time to “seamlessly transition” from development&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LRFmK3"&gt;Now, NASA says the delay is designed to give it more time to evaluate the bidders’ proposals and to “preserve the ability to seamlessly transition” from the development phase, but added it may not need the full extension period and could award the lander contracts earlier. The extension also gives the companies more time to design and develop their lander systems, NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8NlPn"&gt;SpaceX’s lunar lander pitch to NASA is Starship, a roughly 16-story-tall fully reusable vehicle the company has been launching and landing in short, suborbital test flights — called “hops” — in Boca Chica, Texas. The company’s chunk of development funds was $135 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOI0yf"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin got the largest award, $579 million, to develop its Blue Moon lander. The company announced a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925382/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-bezos-lockheed-martin-nasa-artemis-northrop"&gt;National Team&lt;/a&gt;” in 2019 comprised of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to work on the project. Dynetics got $253 million for its lander and has partnered with Sierra Nevada Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RyjpU"&gt;The Biden administration has yet to pick its NASA administrator or release any space policy objectives, but is expected to slow down the Artemis program’s sprint to the moon by 2024 — a date widely viewed as unrealistic. This month, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-science/biden-names-geneticist-lander-for-new-cabinet-level-post-elevating-role-of-science-idUSKBN29K2JD"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its team for the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, picking pioneering geneticist Eric Lander as Biden’s top science adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpUugD"&gt;Trump’s NASA chief Jim Bridenstine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240908/jim-bridenstine-nasa-chief-transition-artemis"&gt;left office on inauguration day&lt;/a&gt; after serving since 2018 and spawning the Artemis program. He handed the agency’s control to his No. 2, Steve Jurczyk as acting administrator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Ring now reportedly partners with more than 2,000 US police and fire departments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V48SlN_y0jD3n8x8XoHjKbCffbY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747534/dseifert170808_1901_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DDzn7O"&gt;All but two US states — Montana and Wyoming— now have police or fire departments participating in Amazon’s Ring network, which lets law enforcement ask users for footage from their Ring security cameras to assist with investigations, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61968b3b-c093-4c4a-a7b7-29b565bc0bc0?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, Figures from Ring show more than 1,189 departments joined the program in 2020 for a total of 2,014. That’s up sharply from 703 departments in 2019 and just 40 in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxsU0q"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; reports that local law enforcement departments on the platform asked for Ring videos for a total of more than 22,335 incidents in 2020. &lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/2021/01/20/law-enforcement-information-requests-in-2020/"&gt;The disclosure data from Ring&lt;/a&gt; also shows that law enforcement made some 1,900 requests — such as subpoenas, search warrants, and court orders— for footage or data from Ring cameras even after the device owner has denied the request. Amazon complied with such requests 57 percent of the time, its figures show, down from 68 percent in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Cbiyb"&gt;Privacy advocates have raised concerns about how Ring data is used by and made available to law enforcement. Ring’s Neighbors app, which allows Ring users to share videos with others nearby &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/7/18528014/fear-social-media-nextdoor-citizen-amazon-ring-neighbors"&gt;has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for containing &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops"&gt;racist comments and reports&lt;/a&gt;. And a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/cute-videos-little-evidence-police-say-amazon-ring-isn-t-n1136026"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last February found that Ring footage wasn’t all that helpful for solving crimes. When it was useful, the Ring footage was mostly used for low-level non-violent property crimes (like the theft of a Nintendo Switch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6knL7"&gt;Ring began adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;support for end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt; on its cameras earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrY24U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The people wanted Lego bike lanes, and Lego is finally listening</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50NW7tJGGIQwkwew2LI3t0PkIlY=/0x318:2048x1683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747447/red_bike_bbdc99c6_d4fd_4e4b_a5d9_7e941d27f36e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/bicycles-40313" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The quest to get one of the most popular toymakers in the world to make a little space for bicycles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="pDwnpu"&gt;A thousand years ago, back in 2019, a regional councilor in the Netherlands named Marcel Steeman undertook a seemingly impossible challenge: convince the makers of one of the most popular toys in the world to do something a little different.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiLlg6"&gt;He wanted Lego, the toy production company based in Billund, Denmark, to add bike lanes to their tiny, brick-made cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lQRv6"&gt;For years, the streets in Lego’s city sets — once called base plates — had space for cars, people, even tiny storm drains, but no designated lanes for zero-emission, human-powered vehicles like bikes. Even worse, it appeared that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Straight-T-Junction-60236-Building/dp/B07GVR2H1L/ref=sr_1_1?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=1&amp;amp;imprToken=babba76d-1982-b9ef-d96&amp;amp;keywords=lego%20street&amp;amp;qid=1582303483&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D20911069%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lego’s streets&lt;/a&gt; had become more hostile toward pedestrians and cyclists over time. As compared to Lego sets from years ago, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor/status/1209476779947253760"&gt;the cars seem to have grown larger&lt;/a&gt; — evolving from four- to six-studs wide — and the roads appeared to be getting wider, while the sidewalks were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor/status/1230865170097897473"&gt;getting more and more narrow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R2Z7Pp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The cars seem to have grown larger, and the roads appeared to be getting wider&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxJoIy"&gt;“It really stood out that Lego City is such a car centered city,” Steeman told me in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QSaOv"&gt;Steeman posted his bike lane proposal to &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/"&gt;Lego’s “Ideas” website&lt;/a&gt;, where enthusiasts can share and vote on each others’ ideas. Really popular ideas can get the chance to ascend up the ladder and become part of an official Lego set — though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241339/metroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo"&gt;only 33 have actually been produced in the program’s 13-year history&lt;/a&gt;. The ideas range from the elegant, like this &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/93089744-0830-43bf-97e9-44bded257903"&gt;incredibly accurate looking violin&lt;/a&gt;, to the idiosyncratic, like this &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/e7429dc6-4b91-4a6d-8c79-b7eb3bda8927"&gt;map of JRR Tolkien’s Middle Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Others have garnered enough support to graduate to full-fledged Lego sets, like this &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/188afa42-fca3-49f9-afe9-00bd9f33725f"&gt;recreation of Sesame Street’s famous brownstones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFZ0uG"&gt;Steeman’s idea caught the attention of Marco te Brommelstroet, an associate professor in urban planning at the University of Amsterdam who tweets under the name &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fietsprofessor"&gt;Cycling Professor&lt;/a&gt;. And one of Brommelstroet’s tweets caught my attention, prompting me &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147028/lego-city-street-bike-lane-car-culture-steeman"&gt;to write a story&lt;/a&gt; that asked the question, “Where are the bike lanes in Lego world?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHuw3k"&gt;But as the idea gained more traction on social media, Lego stayed frustratingly silent. And Steeman’s posts to Lego’s Ideas site kept getting rejected. “I’ve tried several times,” he said. “Sometimes [they were rejected] without reason, one time with the reason it was just a political statement and not a set, and that really confused me.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPIQM4WUAfTt0oZyoacQw-rWG-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268903/eqfOw68y.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Rendering by Marcel Steeman&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;﻿Imagining what Lego bike lanes could be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BpLRhu"&gt;Several people who were supportive of Steeman’s idea of adding bike lanes to Lego’s streetscape tried contacting the company, but to no avail. (A spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment to my original story, nor to this most recent one.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dukVqB"&gt;Meanwhile, Steeman and Brommelstroet continued to dig into Lego’s history and discovered that back in the 1980s and 90s, the company did produce street plates with small bike lanes painted green. But eventually the lanes vanished, and in the years to follow the roads got bigger, and the Lego cars grew from four-studs wide, to six studs, to eight studs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7F90t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the absence of bike lanes may have something to do with Lego’s supply chain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tstsxd"&gt;Not only that, but they learned that the absence of bike lanes may have something to do with Lego’s supply chain. Thalia Verkade, a journalist who was collaborating on &lt;a href="https://www.bol.com/nl/f/goede-reis/9200000111958141/"&gt;a book about mobility&lt;/a&gt; with Brommelstroet, discovered that Lego used a subcontractor for the road plates, which were among the last pieces that were made by a company other than Lego itself. According to Verkade, Lego was trying to buy out the contract to return production of the street plates to their own facilities, Steeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SD2vaV"&gt;Around the same time, Matthew Ashton, an official Lego Master, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew__ashton/status/1209073210030985217"&gt;hinted in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that some new form of roads would be coming to Lego’s city sets “in the not too distant future.” “A cliffhanger,” Steeman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7SJaV"&gt;All the while, Steeman was working at his job as a regional councilor for the province of Northern Holland, where he regularly tackles issues related to mobility. When the pandemic hit, Steeman shifted to working from home, sharing his home’s third floor with his 9-year-old son and all his Legos. “There’s Lego everywhere,” he said, “and I need to tilt my camera upwards to save face in the many digital meetings I have for my work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05eeF4"&gt;Right before the pandemic, Steeman caught wind of rumors of that Lego was going to revolutionize its road system by using adjustable sets and actual bricks, not just the big flat plates, as a way of playing with road designs. That would allow the inclusion of pedestrian crossings and speed bumps — and perhaps bike lanes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDQrKM"&gt;Those redesigned street sets (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Froad-plates-60304&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F31%2F22252640%2Flego-bike-lane-cities-cars-ideas-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;#60304&lt;/a&gt;) were finally released last year, along with a small shopping district (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fshopping-street-60306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F31%2F22252640%2Flego-bike-lane-cities-cars-ideas-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;#60306&lt;/a&gt;) that included a pretzel store, a sporting goods shop, a crosswalk, a couple streetlights, and — at long last — a thin blue bike lane. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new official Shopping Street lego set has a tiny blue bike lane next to a large road and small shops." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yFf4pftQl4AFPNcLn5A4i2FdMQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268907/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_4.05.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fshopping-street-60306&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F31%2F22252640%2Flego-bike-lane-cities-cars-ideas-street#donotlink" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego’s official Shopping Street (#60306), released in late 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl9SC5"&gt;Steeman was shocked, but rather than rest on his laurels, he immediately he took stock of all the ways this updated streetscape still fell short of what he really wanted. The bike lane was small, like really small, only two-studs wide, barely enough room for a cargo bike. Also, the box art depicted a bucket truck parked in the middle of the bike lane. Nonetheless, he chalked it up as a “small victory,” and got back to work promoting his idea for a wider, more accommodating bike lane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBiWk3"&gt;He generated a new rendering of his idea using the new road plates as a foundation. He also added some bike racks, a bike with a child’s seat, and most importantly, big, wide, blue bike lanes. He chose blue as the color, knowing that’s the color used in Billund and around Denmark, where Lego is based. Bike lanes are painted red in his native Holland, so as to prevent people from mistaking them for the water in the canals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaisnL"&gt;Reluctantly, Steeman &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/acdc6e0c-d635-43d4-8292-76510aa54f02"&gt;uploaded his new rendering to Lego’s Ideas website&lt;/a&gt;, anticipating another rejection. But instead, he got another major shock. “To my surprise the idea was accepted within a day,” he said. It was published on the Lego website and now Steeman can try to garner enough support to make it into a real set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nrNcH"&gt;Lego gave him 60 days to get 100 supporters; he did it in 4 hours. Now he has a little more than a year to get 10,000 supporters. The odds are against him — remember, only 33 ideas have ever been accepted — but he’s confident it can be done. And if he doesn’t, he knows that the seed has already been planted with Lego’s designers. A thin blue bike lane can eventually grow into something much larger and safer from the smiling denizens of Legoland. Anything is possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWAM5z"&gt;“In the end, I just want a worldwide generation to grow up with a sustainable, healthy and above all safe alternative to the car-centered world we live in,” Steeman said. “And there is actually no bigger city on earth to start that revolution than Lego City.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WL0Rx4"&gt;He added, “So Lego was probably a bit right when they said it was a political statement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola One 5G Ace review: a weak hand</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Ace offers a large screen and massive battery, but it falls short in some key areas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9iZybh"&gt;The Motorola One 5G Ace is a $399.99 phone that does a somewhat convincing impression of a more expensive phone. It’s large, which feels like a flagship kind of thing, even if that’s not strictly true. It’s relatively heavy, which, in keeping with the wisdom of &lt;a href="https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Gennaro"&gt;Jurassic Park’s unluckiest lawyer&lt;/a&gt;, means it’s probably expensive. It’s &lt;em&gt;shiny&lt;/em&gt;. I held it up for a friend to look at it from six feet away, and he described it as “sleek, like an old iPhone.” And of course, there’s 5G, which was (until somewhat recently) reserved for premium devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEL40T"&gt;It makes a great first impression, but once you look closer, you start to see where it lacks the polish of a high midrange or flagship phone. Its processor stumbles with heavy tasks, that big screen lacks the resolution or faster refresh rate commonly found on high-end devices, and its cameras can’t compete with the best. As is so often the case, you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50HpoH"&gt;Though $400 is affordable by 5G phone standards, it’s still more expensive than quite good non-5G alternatives. The Ace is one or two hundred dollars more than other capable budget options — some of which even offer 5G, too. The question, as always, is what compromises did Motorola make to offer this phone at $400, and are those acceptable trade-offs for someone considering it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v9LXdU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10309889"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oODc6g"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XLDGGB"&gt;The One 5G Ace features a generous 6.7-inch screen. Depending on how you feel about big phones, that might be one of this device’s best selling points. Battery is another strength: the Ace is equipped with a 5,000mAh battery (likely a contributor to its big size), which is head and shoulders above the 4,000 or 4,500mAh capacity typical in budget and midrange phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YVNuTxdHvjlfBf3XF0FWmyDay20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264374/ajohnson_210126_4384_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is a little big for my comfort, but your mileage may vary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fo0JnB"&gt;The Ace is a large phone that makes itself known; you won’t forget it’s in your pocket, for example. It’s a hair taller and wider than the Galaxy S21 Ultra and 1mm thicker. It’s on the heavier side, too, at 212g, probably owing to the battery. I found its size a little awkward. It feels like a strain to reach my thumb across the screen with the phone in one hand. I also fumbled it a couple of times, picking it up too quickly and forgetting how much it weighs. This is very likely a Me Problem, though; my husband thinks it’s comfortable to hold one-handed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EADeFo"&gt;The screen is a 1080 x 2400 LCD panel with a standard 60Hz refresh rate. It’s bright and viewable even in direct sunlight, but it lacks the nice contrast of OLED. Viewing it from slightly off angles results in a loss of contrast and slight color shift. Its resolution is stretched a bit thin on a screen this size, and if you’ve had higher-resolution phones before, you will probably notice it doesn’t look quite as crisp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErZaMtcrsEMzaXGUK-65WadTXZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264375/ajohnson_210126_4384_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace is just shy of 10mm thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGWov3"&gt;Likewise with refresh rate: quick scrolling motions and animations are just a little choppy, particularly if you’ve used a 90Hz or 120Hz screen. If you &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; switching from a phone with better resolution or a faster refresh rate, you won’t feel like you’re missing out on anything, and you’ll probably just appreciate what is a very large, pleasant-to-use screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLXEjj"&gt;With moderate use, I generally got two days out of the Ace’s huge battery. Gaming or watching a lot of videos would cut that down, but it’s hard to imagine a real-world scenario where you wouldn’t get at least a day and then some on a full charge. A 15W fast-ish charger is included in the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RV6i49"&gt;The Ace uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G 5G chipset. It had no problem handling my daily scrolling through Twitter and Instagram, and it generally felt pretty snappy cruising through Zillow and starting the camera. It struggles with certain heavier tasks, like using certain JavaScript features on a webpage (image sliders on this site, for example). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LDD5_Td1ze13qj_6zYeiK5Z8fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264376/ajohnson_210126_4384_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll still find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Ace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ERYS1M"&gt;The Ace is offered with either 4GB of RAM / 64GB of storage or 6GB of RAM / 128GB storage, both of which are expandable via microSD card. I tested the 6GB of RAM variant. Overall, it feels like an appropriate amount of processing power for a $400 phone. The rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is quick and mask-friendly as a bonus, and the Ace includes a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgXUTT"&gt;Then there’s 5G. Worth noting: the Ace supports Sub-6GHz 5G only, which is the more widespread “nationwide” variety. We still have complicated feelings about the state of 5G in the US, but carriers are pouring resources into expanding and improving their existing 5G offerings. In that sense, choosing a phone that supports it now will mean your device is future-proofed for what 5G brings in the next couple of years. Don’t expect a night-and-day difference just yet, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyAF-s3c3YanHVVaQBCo__kND_8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264370/ajohnson_210126_4384_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear camera bump includes a wide, ultrawide, macro, and a flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cDUkfP"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CHlusT"&gt;Motorola has equipped the Ace with three rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel standard wide that kicks out 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. Around front, there’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pDnzjV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EftzLm"&gt;Motorola also throws in a handful of useful software features. There’s an optional on-screen level, which I appreciate as a serial crooked photo-taker. You can opt for a very wide-format image using the main camera, turning the entire screen into a giant viewfinder, which is a fun creative exercise. There’s also a Pro mode if you want to take control of more settings. I didn’t use it much, partly because its insistence on displaying live Kelvin color temperature values stressed me out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8L3li"&gt;Like most others in this class, the Ace takes nice photos in good lighting conditions. I like its handling of color and white balance. Food looks appetizing, and it handles mixed lighting well. Overall, when it stays in its lane, the Ace is capable of very nice photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDCdIc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDp3lc"&gt;The Ace, unfortunately, does not always stay in its lane. Often, it tries to do too much with too little. In some high-contrast ultrawide shots, I saw a lot of noise where it tried to boost shadows — noticeable color noise like I haven’t seen since I was reviewing point-and-shoot cameras [redacted] years ago. Night Vision mode produces a very bright image that just looks strangely artificial and overcooked. Ultrawide photos in anything less than bright outdoor light look very smoothed-over from noise reduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjlxAU"&gt;There’s also some noticeable shutter lag, which would definitely bother someone trying to photograph a moving subject like a child. It was more of a minor annoyance in my particular use cases of sleeping cat and street scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEGzx6"&gt;Even images taken in standard photo mode with the main camera look overworked with close inspection. The camera captures a good amount of detail, but sharpening can be aggressive and crunchy. A photo I took of the sunrise in my backyard was spoiled by some noticeable halo-ing around dark subjects in the foreground. If the Ace had just exposed for the sky and let shadows be, it would have been fine! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCMkdW"&gt;To be clear, it’s not a problem that a $400 phone can’t do all of the things the Ace is trying to do; it’s just that it probably shouldn’t try in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vWgMCo"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wjLxPl"&gt;The Ace ships with Android 10, and an update to 11 has been promised. That’s the only major platform update you’ll get. Beyond that, Motorola will provide two years of security updates, up until January 2023. Motorola is, unfortunately, behind the curve by offering just one major update, even for a budget device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tT8xW"&gt;Motorola’s take on Android includes customizable home screen fonts, icon shapes, and colors, along with a couple of annoying pre-downloaded apps that can be hidden but not uninstalled. I like Moto’s handling of lock screen notifications, or “peek notifications” as it calls them. They’re helpful without being intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHOMy-SW8fE2606yTkwIu8RppVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264368/ajohnson_210126_4384_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ace doesn’t have a lot of direct competition as a $400 phone with 5G, but that will change soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WRppA1"&gt;“You get what you pay for” is an appropriate takeaway here, and I mean that in both a cautionary and a complimentary sense. Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience. But for $400, you should expect to get a phone that will get you through your day without giving you trouble. It should do the things you need it to do — even some things you &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;it to do — and it should see you through a couple of years at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9fTv0"&gt;The One 5G Ace meets all of those requirements, even though it does fall short of good midrange and high-end devices. Though capable, its processor can’t quite hang with the best of them. The camera is a little clumsy. The screen, while plenty big and bright, isn’t going to offer the rich viewing experience of a competing device with an OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PYhLKg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite some resemblance, this isn’t a $1,000 phone, and you won’t get a $1,000 experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYk6z9"&gt;For now, the Ace doesn’t have much direct 5G-capable competition for $400, but that will change quickly. If you plan to hang on to your phone for the next couple of years, it does make sense to pick a 5G model now. For a bit more, the $460 Google Pixel 4A 5G offers a superior camera, a nicer screen, and a slightly better processor. Or you could save some money and get the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G with a 90Hz screen that’s almost as big and a better camera, though it offers a less powerful processor. If it’s an option, you could wait things out for a few months. More affordable 5G devices are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="99Njdr"&gt;I don’t have a problem recommending the Motorola One 5G Ace if — and it’s an important &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; — a large screen and great battery are priorities for you above all else. But if you think you’ll want a better camera or a nicer screen, it would be best to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is getting pulled into a fight about the politics of Israel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HBI1spVamttQ74-OZKIL96IuYcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747269/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lPeUi8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ff62c3c1e1363100b11a6d2/t/600b4063b20dbc7f4fb63cd1/1611350117614/fb-stakeholders-email-zionist.png"&gt;On November 10th&lt;/a&gt;, a Facebook employee sent out an unusual email to an unknown outside party, hoping to arrange a conversation about how the platform moderated against anti-Semitism. “We are looking at the question of how we should interpret attacks on ‘Zionists,’” reads the letter, whose recipient was redacted, “to determine whether the term is a proxy for attacking Jewish or Israeli people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foH8VW"&gt;That strange but seemingly innocuous email has set off a firestorm in certain corners of the left. Since Tuesday, activists have been &lt;a href="https://act.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/eESUM2zQ0UGFUie0wmC_bw2?sourceid=1001340"&gt;circulating a petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the platform to halt any potential changes to the way Facebook moderates the word “Zionist.” Both sides agree the term is often used as part of racist rhetoric that is accurately described as hate speech and should be removed. At the same time, the term is also used by Jewish critics of specific Israeli policies, particularly the country’s settlement policy. Classifying the term as hate speech would end up stifling those criticisms — at least on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qIsfK"&gt;Hosted by the progressive group Jewish Voices for Peace (JVP), the petition ultimately drew more than 20,000 signatures, including artist-activists like Michael Chabon, Peter Gabriel, and Wallace Shawn. “We are deeply concerned about Facebook’s proposed revision of its hate speech policy to consider ‘Zionist’ as a proxy for ‘Jew’ or ‘Jewish,’” the petition reads. “This is the wrong solution to a real and important problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b7Zf9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is the wrong solution to a real and important problem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bv9zmg"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook denied that there are any plans to reclassify the word in its hate speech policy. But at the same time, Facebook did not dispute the authenticity of the email or deny that the platform’s classification of the term “Zionist” was under review — simply saying no decision had been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FmyRe"&gt;“Under our current policies, we allow the term ‘Zionist’ in political discourse, but remove it when it’s used as a proxy for Jews or Israelis in a dehumanizing or violent way,” said a Facebook spokesperson. “Just as we do with all of our policies regularly, we are independently engaging with experts and stakeholders to ensure that this policy is in the right place, but this does not mean we will change our policy.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjo3zi"&gt;Even without a concrete policy change to respond to, JVP sees Facebook’s email as part of a broader campaign to shift how the platform treats criticism of the Israeli government. “Restricting the word ‘Zionist’ as part of a hate speech policy won’t actually make Jewish people safer,” said Rabbi Alissa Wise, Deputy Director at Jewish Voice for Peace, who said the proposed Facebook change would only “prevent its users from holding the Israeli government accountable for harming Palestinian people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KITnWr"&gt;“Social media companies should allow people to hold our governments accountable to us,” Wise continued, “not shield governments from accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0SvOCZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Social media companies should allow people to hold our governments accountable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gr7xa"&gt;The new changes seem plausible in part because of the rapid changes in Facebook’s public policies towards anti-Semitism, many of them positive. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/community-standards-enforcement-report-aug-2020/"&gt;In August&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook altered its hate speech policy to directly address anti-Semitism after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.stopantisemitism.org/open-letter-to-fb"&gt;a letter from a coalition of Jewish groups&lt;/a&gt;. The revised hate speech policy included a range of specific references to anti-Semitism, including a clause that explicitly classified generalizations about “Jewish people running the world” as anti-Semitic hate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3Qadg"&gt;But Facebook didn’t make all the changes requested in the August letter. The signees urged Facebook to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism &lt;a href="https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism"&gt;developed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)&lt;/a&gt;. But the IHRA standards include a number of provisions that potentially limit criticism of Israel itself, classifying “applying double standards” to the country’s actions or generally “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination” as anti-Semitic. These same provisions have been the subject of US congressional proposals around anti-Semitism, which were criticized by the ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/rights-protesters/latest-attack-free-speech-israel-palestine-debate"&gt;on similar grounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBCMGW"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EfJ6wuZU0AApKsG?format=png&amp;amp;name=medium"&gt;a letter to one of the project’s architects&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said the IHRA definition “has been invaluable” in informing Facebook’s policies, but left the details of the implementation more vague. And Facebook’s current hate speech policy does not mention Israel or Zionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKrenz"&gt;Facebook has continued to engage with groups on both sides of the debate, but the ongoing nature of the outreach has raised tempers instead of calming them. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MilsteinFF/status/1293231650696904706"&gt;Architects of the August letter&lt;/a&gt; have continued to pressure Facebook to “fully adopt” the IHRA definition, and it’s unclear how much sway these arguments have within Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxpZiR"&gt;“Facebook’s updates to its hate speech policy haven’t satisfied its IHRA-focused critics, whose goal isn’t to get Facebook to deplatform antisemitism,” &lt;a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/israel-advocacy-groups-urge-facebook-to-label-criticism-of-israel-as-hate-speech/"&gt;wrote activist Lara Friedman&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the August letter, “but to get Facebook to deplatform criticism of Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Steam Game Festival kicks off Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKAOrklpcmADvWpV0MCZs4We86o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68747239/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="idB2wi"&gt;Valve’s latest Steam Game Festival begins Wednesday, giving access to playable demos of more than 500 upcoming games from indie developers, along with livestreamed chats and panel discussions. The first iteration of the festival took place alongside The Game Awards in December 2019, and was followed by similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506259/steam-autumn-game-festival-2020-indie-developers"&gt;events last fall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184319/steam-game-festival-sale-gdc-2020-indie-developers"&gt;spring that provided indie developers&lt;/a&gt; a chance to show off their titles after the 2020 Game Developers Conference was canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1PpyV"&gt;A trailer video from Steam titled &lt;em&gt;Play What’s Next&lt;/em&gt; teases a few of the games that look to be available for demo during the event, which include &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; from Feral Cat Den; &lt;em&gt;The Riftbreaker &lt;/em&gt;from Exor Studios; &lt;em&gt;Narita Boy&lt;/em&gt; from Studio Koba;  &lt;em&gt;Almighty: Kill Your Gods &lt;/em&gt;from Runwild Entertainment; &lt;em&gt;Fling to the Finish&lt;/em&gt; by Splitside Games; and &lt;em&gt;Black Book&lt;/em&gt; from Morteshka, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ffMWxY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ql8yhNMZPnM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0BrR13"&gt;The latest Steam Game Festival starts February 3rd at 1PM ET and runs through Tuesday February 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rh65vf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbGON3"&gt;The first two months of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign have been chaotic: local health departments and hospitals are struggling put the limited shots they have available in arms, and people eligible for those shots are often frustrated by buggy sign-up websites. Older adults, in particular, are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;having trouble&lt;/a&gt; with online tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNzjBE"&gt;In New York City, one of the main pain points is that everything is fractured. Multiple different groups — including the city, the state, and various hospital groups — are distributing the vaccine across dozens of sites. That leaves New Yorkers juggling multiple registration websites as they search for open slots&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9O5Ku"&gt;After experiencing the frustration of jumping from site to site to site firsthand, software developer Dan Benamy reached out to some friends and colleagues to start building a platform to pull every open vaccine appointment into one, &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;easy-to-use site.&lt;/a&gt; Right now, it pulls in vaccine appointments from around 40 locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9OSWqZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The hottest website in NYC now is &lt;a href="https://t.co/WdGl4JTZhQ"&gt;https://t.co/WdGl4JTZhQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Built by a genius team of volunteers, it scans most vaccination apptmt systems to tell you where there are openings. Updates every few mins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Of course it's outrageous that it's vols doing this not fed/state/city gov't)&lt;/p&gt;— Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1354454113006845952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqvRbJ"&gt;“We just saw a place that we could help,” Benamy says. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Benamy and Michael Kuznetsov, another volunteer, about the website and the goal of making vaccine appointment sign-ups a little bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZom3O"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCnePg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this project get started? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47bm9o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;When they opened up vaccination slots to older folks, my grandparents qualified. I went online to try and figure it all out. New York City has this nice site that lists all the places where you can get vaccines, but you have to check each location individually to see if there’s any availability. I thought that there was an opportunity to aggregate some of this information. I reached out to a couple of folks I knew initially, and we started building this very quickly. Other folks started coming in on the effort — developers, designers, other people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrZDvD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you had the idea and started connecting with other folks, how long did it take to get things up and running? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u12i8v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;There’s been a lot a lot of late nights, but I think it was two or three days after we started there was something we were showing friends and family. Then, several days later, it  was still very minimal but we felt like it added enough value to be worth sharing. We’ve been iterating on it every day, adding in more data, improving the data, and making it easier to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LG1zU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any plans to partner with the city, or any other officials on the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFAwIq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy:&lt;/em&gt; If there’s something that we could do that would that would be helpful to the city, or if there’s somebody who has a data feed about vaccine availability that they’d be interested in us adding to the site, we’d love to do that. Whatever opportunity we have to help, we’re happy to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4rVkG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you heard from people who have used the site to set up their vaccination appointments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJk0S6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy:&lt;/em&gt;  We have a little feedback form on the site, and we’ve definitely had a stream of folks saying how helpful it was that there was something like this to use for vaccine appointments. And we know that the page has been viewed tens of thousands of times in the past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFqEQi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kuznetsov: O&lt;/em&gt;ne nice story there is that one of the volunteers that joined our effort this week, actually joined because he used the website to help find his grandfather a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m9juHR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We got vaccine appointments for all three family members and it was entirely thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ny_covid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ny_covid&lt;/a&gt;! I highly recommend monitoring &lt;a href="https://t.co/DJWE1jpEDs"&gt;https://t.co/DJWE1jpEDs&lt;/a&gt; - it WILL pay off. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VGgG2BXzQi"&gt;https://t.co/VGgG2BXzQi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Janna Zagari (she/her) (@jannazagari) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jannazagari/status/1355254208795127816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Qu4J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of problems with the vaccine rollout has been that many websites and online sign-up forms aren’t easily accessible for people who aren’t tech savvy. Is that something the team thinks about when building your site? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJYcls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;There’s a real focus on simplicity on the site. You don’t need to navigate around, you can just go to &lt;a href="http://nycvaccinelist.com"&gt;nycvaccinelist.com&lt;/a&gt;, and if there’s any availability it just shows it immediately on your screen. We want to try and make it accessible to folks that may be more or less sophisticated. We’d be open to including other languages also — anything that can connect people with vaccines. I’ll just be incremental improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqOVu9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your next steps for the site?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVYUW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;The top priority right now is getting more information into the site. The more places that we can aggregate vaccine availability from, the easier it will be for people to find vaccines, and that’s really all that matters. We’re continuing to build more tools to pull in information from other sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cr80qc"&gt;We already have information on appointments in the greater metro area, and Long Island, and another next step is to keep filling in more appointments in the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ve8eC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like to come in and fill a need like this? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHnv8W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benamy: &lt;/em&gt;The tools are out there to let people do amazing things, and we thought that if there was at least a chance we could help, we’d give it a shot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdvuBU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kuznetsov:&lt;/em&gt; If there’s even one life saved because somebody got a shot who wouldn’t have gotten it — that’s lit a fire under our seats as we go and do this every day. I’ve heard a couple of people say that if six months go by and this thing doesn’t matter anymore because the systems built by other people are great, and everyone’s been vaccinated — that’s a win for us.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G.I. Joe’s Fortnite collaboration includes a Snake Eyes skin and action figure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QCGm20RRmzzAQ_fIzrQgLsLOpo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745932/Fortnite_Snake_Eyes_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nd7ij7"&gt;With all of its recent licensed characters, which includes everyone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;Sarah Connor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt;, the virtual battlefield of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is starting to resemble a playground full of action figures. When you think about it like that, a collaboration with G.I. Joe makes a lot of sense. With that in mind, Epic and Hasbro announced that iconic character Snake Eyes will be available as part of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe starting today — both in-game and as a physical toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juz7aM"&gt;The new version of the character is called Snake Eyes: Zero Point edition, an allusion to a key part of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;one which took on more significance this season&lt;/a&gt;). The in-game version will be available starting on January 30th for 1,800 V-bucks, while a 6-inch-tall action figure is also available to preorder for $39.99 &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/fortnite-g-i-joe-collab-snake-eyes-zero-point-edition"&gt;via Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt;. Hasbro says that the figure will feature accessories inspired by “the rich history of the Snake Eyes character” as well as a few that will be familiar to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; fans, like the classic Boogie Bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guW1Yi"&gt;There have already been plenty of toys and figures based on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s original characters, of course, but this collaboration hints at something different, as licensing deals become a bigger part of the battle royale. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;Next stop, metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google union in turmoil following global alliance announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHT9-9W5-oVvJdnlwiejyaEdyAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745616/acastro_180820_1777_google_china_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7C80tD"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) is in turmoil following the announcement of an international alliance on Monday. The alliance, Alpha Global, was billed as a worker-led initiative, but union members in the US say they didn’t know about it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22243138/google-union-alphabet-workers-europe-announce-global-alliance"&gt;until &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published an exclusive&lt;/a&gt;. That piece included a press release quote from AWU executive council member Parul Koul, which she says she didn’t write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq5hyd"&gt;The news was an unwelcome surprise to union members who expect the Alphabet Workers Union to run democratically. Now, multiple sources tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some AWU organizers are considering pushing the group to disaffiliate from the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a national union representing workers in telecommunications and media. AWU has also set up a committee to investigate CWA’s role in the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlqqSg"&gt;In a statement, AWU executive council member Auni Ahsan said: “We want to honor the concerns that have been raised, but our primary focus as a union isn’t affiliation or disaffiliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HM0bwu"&gt;The upheaval points to the difficulties facing AWU. As a so-called minority union, it isn’t recognized by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and can’t require Alphabet or its subsidiaries like Google to negotiate a contract for its members. Its power comes in part from uniting Alphabet workers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224926/google-union-700-members"&gt;swelling its membership base&lt;/a&gt; to mount public pressure campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvQ7xo"&gt;Since the union went public on January 4th, it’s grown from 230 members to more than 800. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/computerfemme/status/1346144349218889728"&gt;some members have raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that the Communications Workers of America pushed the union to go public prematurely. They also say the CWA has a history of publishing big announcements without first consulting Google workers. Amr Gaber, a Google engineer who helped organize the 2018 walkout, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the union has been more concerned with claiming turf than listening to the needs of organizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLiEOT"&gt;The Alphabet union’s rapid expansion has also underlined the need for clear rules and processes, including when the group puts out statements and who controls major announcements. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;AWU has called on YouTube to permanently ban Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/press/releases/retaliation-against-margaret-mitchell/"&gt;expressed concern about the treatment of Margaret Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, co-lead of the ethical AI team. Both statements involved significant input from union members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUCu4q"&gt;That didn’t happen with the global alliance announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMAt3q"&gt;Uni Global Union, a Switzerland-based federation of labor unions, organized the coalition, and worked with at least one CWA representative on the rollout strategy. The idea was to bring together unions representing Google workers across the globe and allow members to share information more easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX3ZL1"&gt;Uni sent out a press release stating that “Alphabet workers” were “announcing a new global union alliance to build a more ethical and accountable company.” The press release included a quote from Koul talking about the importance of global solidarity, and CWA representative Wes McEnany told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the alliance was worker-led in a phone call about the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf4zmJ"&gt;After the article came out, however, multiple AWU members told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they were blindsided by the news. A Google worker in Europe also said they hadn’t known about the announcement, but noted they typically don’t find out about union news before it becomes public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ov8GCb"&gt;When asked why so many AWU members had been left out of the planning, a spokesperson for CWA said there had been a mixup in the messaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUPNIr"&gt;On January 25th, AWU called an emergency meeting. According to meeting notes reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Koul said Uni’s announcement “happened [without] any of us being notified or given a heads up that this alliance was being formed or that this statement was going out.” She stressed that she’d never said the quote attributed to her in the press release, and noted she’d been “burned” by the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgPI2a"&gt;(Koul did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHd5vb"&gt;CWA organizer Tom Smith said he hadn’t known about the situation until that morning, claiming CWA president Christopher Shelton sent an email “literally saying ‘WTF?!’” He added that Uni had been asked to take the press release down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJT7u8"&gt;Uni told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that McEnany was “very involved” in the alliance, and during the meeting, McEnany acknowledged he was partly to blame — he’d told Uni to attribute the quote to Koul. He said the timeline of the announcement had been fuzzy. (McEnany spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; three days prior to the article’s publication.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLnIMe"&gt;Later in the meeting, Koul announced McEnany would be resigning from his role working with AWU, though he is not leaving CWA altogether.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHRcJw"&gt;On January 29th, CWA sent out a newsletter, which, again, falsely attributed the quote to Koul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkkNBk"&gt;McEnany’s resignation did not quell concerns from Google organizers like Kathryn Spiers, who says she sees the botched alliance announcement as part of a larger pattern. In 2019, Google fired Spiers and four other workers who were engaged in workplace organizing. When CWA offered to pay the workers’ legal fees, the group agreed, with the understanding that CWA would not publish information about the case without first getting their approval, according to multiple sources. Despite that understanding, workers say CWA put out a press release referencing Spiers, before she’d been fired and her name had become public, and without getting her approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYhhDZ"&gt;During the emergency meeting on Monday, Spiers spoke about her experience with CWA and said she wanted to acknowledge that the alliance announcement was not an isolated incident. Now, she’s participating in a campaign to disaffiliate from the larger organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIJ3x7"&gt;The campaign could threaten to destabilize AWU, a nascent union still in its first month of public life. But it might also be a sign that the organization is working as intended. Workers are coming together to push for change, even if it means breaking up with a powerful ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib2uXE"&gt;If that happens, it will be a serious setback for the Communications Workers of America. In 2020, the organization launched CODE-CWA, a campaign dedicated to unionizing workers in the tech industry. Losing Google could make it more difficult for CWA to organize staff at other big tech companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyFTxz"&gt;For some workers who’ve been organizing with Google for years, however, disaffiliation might be the only option. If the campaign fails, they say they are likely to leave the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKkpRR"&gt;“Google couldn’t have paid for this kind of union busting,” Spiers says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWeRm8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIwVtC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coachella has been canceled for the third time due to the coronavirus pandemic </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2019 Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival - Weekend 2 - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFweUJiJeNcZnuZYiVzdhhDBDjY=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68745580/1144330957.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RzbrmP"&gt;Health officials have ordered the Coachella music festival scheduled for April to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. It’s the third time the pandemic has forced the annual outdoor festival that draws hundreds of thousands of fans to the California desert to be postponed or canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbaFdk"&gt;“The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Country Music Festival currently scheduled for April 2021 are hereby canceled,” Riverside County Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said in an &lt;a href="https://www.rivcoph.org/Portals/0/Documents/CoronaVirus/Jan2021/HealthProviders/Scan0040.pdf"&gt;order issued Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Kaiser’s order also canceled the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, also scheduled for April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Y6CVJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Due to the pandemic, Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser today (Jan. 29) signed a public health order canceling Coachella Valley Music and Arts, Stagecoach Country Music festivals planned for April 2021. We look forward to when the events may return. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YAIn8uTea9"&gt;https://t.co/YAIn8uTea9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Cameron Kaiser (@RivCoDoc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RivCoDoc/status/1355287119678337024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7LX9ul"&gt;“This order is intended to reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19,” the order states. “If COVID-19 were detected at these festivals, the scope and number of attendees and the nature of the venue would make it infeasible, if not impossible, to track those who may be placed at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KniYRj"&gt;Coachella’s 2020 festival was originally scheduled for April 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21174083/coachella-postponed-coronavirus-october-music-festival-stagecoach"&gt;then later postponed&lt;/a&gt; to October 2020, before finally being scrapped altogether until April 2021. There’s no word from organizers or health officials about when Coachella will be rescheduled, but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/festivals/9518452/coachella-canceled-april-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; it may be pushed to October. And if vaccine distribution continues to lag and coronavirus cases keep multiplying, it’s likely we’ll start to see other large spring and summer events postponed or canceled  as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vFFMq"&gt;Coachella organizers didn’t immediately reply to a request for more information Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
