  &lt;p id="23IKpk"&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;literally right now &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;celebrating &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s 10-year anniversary in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, but we couldn’t throw an epic two-day event without also bringing you a teensy bit of tech news — and Eero co-founder and CEO Nick Weaver just did that at &lt;em&gt;On The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Weaver says that Eero, an early adopter of the Thread protocol, will be upgrading all its Thread-equipped Wi-Fi routers to fully support Matter as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is the upcoming 2022 standard that should allow for easier setup of smart home devices, with any compatible Matter host able to discover and work with any Matter client. Amazon smart home rivals Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"&gt;Google are also on board&lt;/a&gt; with Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SArPKS"&gt;“It does feel different this time,” Weaver says, asked about his company’s long support for Thread, a protocol that hadn’t shown any signs of taking off until it became part of the Matter standard. Now, many Eeros are primed to make far greater use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJL7Cu"&gt;Weaver also mentioned on stage that Eero has been exploring the idea of a cellular backup system for the Eero routers, similar to how parent company Amazon’s other brand Ring uses a cellular backup for its alarm system, though Weaver didn’t make any promises today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZDgI358CqIfHstqNzDwtg8xkG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22949797/IMG_1277.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="idusrh"&gt;When we asked whether he’s seeing any competition from cellular providers (which now offer 5G home connections that can come with their own routers), whether he sees a trend there, he seemed to brush off the idea. “The biggest trend we are seeing is people are upgrading to gigabit in droves,” he says. He says that Eero has seen 75 percent growth in its business selling Eero to ISPs. “ISPs don’t want to get service calls about their Wi-Fi routers, that’s why they go with us,” he tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNxkgb"&gt;Weaver says the company currently designs routers independent of your internet connection — however good or bad your ISP connection is doesn’t really factor in. Right now, it’s the last mile (or realistically, the last hundred feet) to turn your cable or fiber connection into Wi-Fi across your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzpIP4"&gt;In case you’re curious what’s on Weaver’s own home network, he told Nilay and Dieter that his long list of devices includes a smart oven — and there’s an Apple HomeKit bridge among his many hubs. Will Eero support HomeKit? Weaver wouldn’t say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile delays shutdown of Sprint 3G network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1b-3gOt-1pUqjPvo4j7dC_X3UE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035219/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile has delayed its plans to shut down Sprint’s CDMA network | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kyB0TN"&gt;T-Mobile said it will delay its planned shutdown of Sprint’s 3G network by three months to ensure its “partners” have time to help customers with the transition. It had originally planned to phase out the network in January; that date has now been pushed to March 31st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Kh5mD"&gt;“Recently it’s become increasingly clear that some of those partners haven’t followed through on their responsibility to help their customers through this shift,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Fupdate-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “So, we’re stepping up on their behalf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRagtl"&gt;T-Mobile’s statement doesn’t mention it by name, but likely is referring to Dish Network. The two sides have tangled over T-Mobile’s announcement it was shutting down Sprint’s legacy network, because of the impact it would have on Dish’s Boost Mobile customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSrfgT"&gt;As one of the conditions of the T-Mobile/Sprint Merger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;Dish acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in July, 2020 with the goal of Dish taking Sprint’s place as a fourth wireless carrier in the US. After T-Mobile announced it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;shut down Sprint’s CDMA network&lt;/a&gt;, Dish chairman Charlie Ergen compared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;T-Mobile to the Grinch&lt;/a&gt;, and later said his company was making every effort to migrate its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsLa4p"&gt;But T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Ffor-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22741762%2Ftmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Dish was “dragging their feet in getting their customers upgraded to the superior 4G/5G world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99YHwf"&gt;The Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618472/doj-letter-dish-t-mobile-3g-cdma-network-shutdown"&gt;Justice told Dish Network and T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in a July &lt;a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; that it had “grave concerns” about the shutdown of Sprint’s legacy network, and urged both sides to take “all appropriate steps” to reduce the impact on customers who still rely on the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6gjLQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Apple’s Mini LED MacBook Pros avoid the iPad Pro’s downsides?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8DNKAxG7r1CcuvHcMmvs48x_mw=/0x101:1496x1098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035215/0930B0A7_5370_4E42_AD2D_52450E957E8A.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="plMltY"&gt;When Apple announced the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, I knew it was time to upgrade from my 2018 model. And I wasn’t disappointed. The improved brightness (especially when watching movies in HDR) and superior contrast have made the purchase worthwhile — even if iPadOS continues to underwhelm and disappoint in other ways. It’s a wonderful screen that makes me want to use the iPad wherever I can instead of my laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWtUtt"&gt;As a refresher of what Mini LED is, there are thousands of tiny LEDs behind the display — much smaller than those in conventional TVs or LCD displays — that allow for more precise backlighting. In turn, this leads to deeper black levels and all of the other benefits mentioned above. Apple’s iPads and MacBook already had excellent displays with accurate, wide color reproduction. But Mini LED takes their display quality to the next level. Add a smoother 120Hz refresh rate on top of that, plus all those glorious ports, and you can see why people are excited and these machines are already heavily backordered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OuBhmX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple finally listened to the pros","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tlPE7v"&gt;But at least with the iPad Pro, this transition to Mini LED didn’t come without any downsides. And with the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros now adopting the same Pro Display XDR (Mini LED) technology, it’s worth tracking whether those same downsides have come along to Apple’s laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FzCI0"&gt;Dieter addressed one of the issues, blooming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly if you’re using the iPad Pro in a dark room, you’ll sometimes notice a halo of light around bright objects on screen when they’re surrounded by a black background. This is a tradeoff that’s inherent to full-array local dimming, and while it bothers some people, I’ve rarely found it annoying in my time using the iPad Pro. Either way, I think it’s occasionally worth dealing with for the  other gains you get in brightness and contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjCQqB"&gt;Still, blooming might prove more frustrating on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733173/macbook-pro-specced-out-high-end-price"&gt;a fully-loaded $6,000 laptop&lt;/a&gt; designed for professional editing work. I’m curious to see whether Apple has made any adjustments to diminish the issue on its new MacBook Pros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YK11u"&gt;The other downside of Apple’s Mini LED iPad Pro display is shadowing. As the new iPad made its way to buyers, people noticed &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252801469"&gt;a light shadow&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2021-12-9-screen-shadow.2297031/"&gt;runs along the very edges&lt;/a&gt; of the display. This shadow isn’t one of those things that’s present on some iPads and not others: it’s visible on every single M1 12.9-inch iPad Pro, because it has to do with how the Mini LED system is designed. Whereas most of the panel has superb uniformity, it falls off at the edges where the dimming zones trail off. Like blooming, this is something I don’t personally pay much attention to: my eyes are usually focused closer to the middle of the screen, where everything looks great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vklu2p"&gt;These edge shadows can also be seen on Apple’s premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161487/apple-mac-pro-display-xdr-review-6k-lcd-screen-price-features"&gt;Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt; monitor. Overcast developer Marco Arment has described them as “the really big downside” of the display. Again, this is something that might be a bigger irritation on an expensive, marketed-at-pros laptop. Perhaps Apple has found a way to run the backlighting a little further beyond the bezels to avoid such an obvious falloff in brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgQ62r"&gt;The positives of the new MacBook Pro screens should easily outweigh the cons. They’re brighter and sharper than ever with the same eye-searing HDR highlights as the iPad Pro. But if you’re a sticker for the small things, it might be worth waiting until reviews are out to see if Apple has made improvements to its still-new display tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get a year of PlayStation Plus for just $37 this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXsYgLBoOBejxphQZtd_mGIUU2E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035081/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="69NfPM"&gt;For this weekend, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a whole year of Playstation Plus at Eneba for just $37&lt;/a&gt; by using the code &lt;strong&gt;365USVERGE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Anyone who owns a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 should consider becoming a PlayStation Plus subscriber. By becoming one, you get access to a variety of perks, including online multiplayer, cloud storage for saves, and complementary games every month, as well as exclusive discounts. This discount is only valid through Saturday, October 23rd, though, so you’ll have to move fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MTpAQO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVCvda"&gt;A sharp, new entry in the Logitech arsenal of gaming accessories is the Logitech G305, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B086PJKVVT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for just $40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to its lowest price since January. This false ambidextrous, wireless mouse features six programmable buttons and a 12K DPI sensor. A single AA battery powers the mouse, and while it isn’t rechargeable, the G305 claims to have a 250-hour lifespan on a single battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJN2D6"&gt;While the specs on this mouse are certainly nothing to scoff at, the real selling point is the variety of colorways available for this peripheral. Besides the typical black and white, the G305 also comes in teal, blue, and lavender. It may not be the lightest mouse on the market, but at a meager 99 grams, the G305 definitely falls into the featherweight category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="38NJ6k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10821865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This versatile smart hub features an 8-inch screen and adds touchscreen functionality to the ubiquitous Alexa platform. Pull up recipes, watch news highlights, or even make video calls with the new and improved built-in 13MP camera. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; called the second-generation Echo Show “still the best Alexa smart display” and was particularly impressed by the new camera and robust speaker quality. If you aren’t yet an Alexa user, the Echo Show 8 is a great introduction to this helpful service. In case you miss out on this deal, it typically comes around every month or so. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1zjHYl"&gt;The Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling earbuds have hit an all-time low at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and are available for just $128. These classy earbuds feature excellent sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and can last for up to six hours on a single charge. They are slightly more bulky than Apple’s AirPods Pro and don’t include wireless charging or water resistance, but the aesthetics and overall sound quality of these earbuds are certainly still best-in-class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RJE6HB"&gt;The cringey humor of &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3 &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;its first year of DLC can be yours today for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Borderlands-Ultimate-Xbox-Digital-Code/dp/B08NDTLLYX?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This digital code Xbox version of Borderlands Ultimate Edition has had its price cut in half and includes the base game as well as four massive chunks of DLC and a ton of cosmetic options. The writing of the Borderlands series has always been divisive, but regardless of your stance on poop humor, the gameplay remains extremely addictive. A staple of the loot-shooter genre, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; marries a virtually limitless number of weapon combinations with RPG-style character builds and its own unique brand of comedy. While it definitely has more than enough features and content for an engaging single-player experience, the game also supports up to four players via online co-op.

  &lt;p&gt;Almost infinite listening, so long as the weather’s kind&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AMzwUr"&gt;Solar-powered headphones are a tantalizing prospect. The battery life of wireless models has improved a lot over the years, but it’s still far from perfect, and those wide headbands provide the perfect surface for a sheet of solar cells to provide continuous charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbymh1"&gt;Urbanista isn’t the first company to attempt to make good on this idea — JBL announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383302/urbanista-los-angeles-solar-powered-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones"&gt;pair of its own in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that it was subsequently forced to delay due to the pandemic — but its Los Angeles are the first solar-powered headphones to have actually made it to market. Although the design is almost identical to the company’s existing Miami headphones, a layer of PowerFoyle solar cells on the headband allows them to continuously suck up solar energy when exposed to light. Urbanista reckons the average listener should be able to go months without having to charge them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFpYHQ"&gt;It’s an enticing idea, one that has the potential to remove an item from the list of devices people have to charge on a regular basis, but can it live up to the expectations? And even if it does, are these $199 (£169 / €199) solar-powered headphones worth keeping charged in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6josgN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10819496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="07XO0a"&gt;Urbanista’s Los Angeles have a basic, uninspired design that’s broadly in line with the company’s existing Miami headphones. My review sample was a fairly boring black, but there’s also a more colorful “Sand Gold” option if you’re feeling more adventurous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1nzK1"&gt;Where things get interesting are with the Los Angeles’ headband, which has a layer of Powerfoyle material produced by Exeger for capturing the light that eventually gets turned into battery power. Unfortunately, this material is black regardless of which color you opt to get the headphones in, and from the press images, I don’t think it looks great with the gold option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSUogVf8HXEOoTl2a0-dWoIUiu0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944546/IMG_1598.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Urbanista&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Urbanista’s app shows exactly how much power is being gained and lost. Here the headphones were being used in direct sunlight, playing music with ANC on, and gaining power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d0tSas"&gt;For the most part, the headphones’ solar charging capabilities aren’t something you need to actively think about. They’ll automatically charge regardless of whether you’re wearing them and listening to music or whether they’re turned off (although software caps their solar charging at 90 percent to protect the battery). But if you want to get a more in-depth idea of what’s going on under the hood, Urbanista’s companion app offers a great interface that shows the headphones’ power draw versus its solar charging. There’s a lot of fun to be had messing around with the app, seeing what impact turning ANC on and off has on battery drain or how much solar power you can gain from putting the headphones in the most direct sunlight you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IonuLi"&gt;I think the benefit most people will get from the Los Angeles solar charging is as a metaphorical parachute, slowing the battery drain so you don’t have to recharge them so often. How effective this parachute ends up being will differ a lot depending on whether you use them to listen to music inside at your desk or on the subway or whether you wear them while out and about in a sunnier part of the world. But as a baseline, listening to them in a pitch-black room with ANC off should get you 80 hours of listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DnoJc"&gt;In my experience using them on cloudy fall days in the UK, I generally saw Urbanista’s app reporting either minimal power drain or else adding an almost equal amount of power to the amount being consumed. It was less common for me to see the headphones actually gaining power as I used them, but this did happen when I used them in direct sunlight (as you can see from the screenshot above). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTOlQa"&gt;The times when I saw the headphones gaining the most power from solar charging were when they were sitting unused in the sun. I’m sure you could get into the habit of leaving them on a sunny windowsill, positioned so that the headband was pointing directly at the sun to maximize the benefit, but if you’re going to make that effort, then you might as well plug them in. The beauty of the Los Angeles headphones is that you don’t really have to think about it, and obsessing over leaving them to charge in the sun feels like it’s missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zcwzIooND8Oe1R09Ub91A2p301w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941389/jporter_211018_4812_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The headphones can be snug on larger heads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvd82xk2e2UH-94opLd0Rd5oZ6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941393/jporter_211018_4812_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This small logo is the only visible indicator of their solar-charging abilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rVMTnp"&gt;After two weeks of listening for a couple of hours a day, including while sitting at my desk next to a west-facing window, as well as on the London Underground with ANC on, Urbanista’s app reports that I’m still at 81 percent power. It’s an impressively small amount of battery drain, even while I used them in situations with no natural light or in overcast conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESVaZe"&gt;I don’t think anyone’s going to get away with never having to connect the Los Angeles headphones to a USB-C charger. But based on my experience, I could see them lasting for a month or more of regular usage during winter and even longer if you’re using them in sunnier conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cxSUwt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I could see these headphones lasting for months without needing a charge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2To0Zo"&gt;Apart from the solar cell-equipped headband, the Los Angeles look and function like a typical pair of wireless noise-canceling headphones. Their controls will look familiar to anyone who’s used a pair of wireless headphones in the past five years. On the right earcup, there’s a trio of buttons for volume up, down, and a middle playback control button that also turns the headphones on and off. On the left, there’s a customizable shortcut button that responds to either a short or long-press to toggle noise cancellation, transparency mode, or a voice assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXXPl3"&gt;It’s a sensible selection of buttons; I just wish the volume controls weren’t so stupidly close together. You can learn to live with them, but just a little more spacing would make that pause button much easier to feel with your finger in a pinch. It would also have been nice for there to be a dedicated shortcut to put the headphones into pairing mode rather than having to manually disconnect from a previous device first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jCE0UuqE1-swdD7u38ECWCBugk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941386/jporter_211018_4812_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playback controls on the right, and ANC and USB-C charging on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twjrlqOLYOxSt4vZi60O5AcHyOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941390/jporter_211018_4812_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branding on the headphones is minimal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrfXp0"&gt;On the left earcup, there’s a USB-C port for when the sun’s rays aren’t enough to keep these headphones charged, but unfortunately, there’s no 3.5mm jack for wired connections. Urbanista tells me it omitted the physical jack to keep the headphones’ power consumption as low as possible. In fairness, the Los Angeles’ battery life is 30 hours higher than Urbanista’s Miami headphones, which “only” deliver 50 hours, suggesting that these power optimizations have worked. But a 3.5mm option would still be useful for in-flight entertainment or work calls where I don’t want to risk a Bluetooth disconnection, and it’s a shame the Los Angeles don’t have this flexibility built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohJ9sJ"&gt;Away from the sunlight and into the bowels of London’s Underground network, I was pleasantly surprised by the Los Angeles’ noise canceling performance, which fairly successfully drowned out the screeching of the tube as it flew through subway tunnels. It’s not as capable as class leaders like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;, but I think the level of ANC offered by the Los Angeles is good for the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XSxcYo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A snug fit helps with noise cancellation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vZJ9GL"&gt;The ability of the Los Angeles to cancel out noise is helped by the fact that they fit snugly on your head while you wear them. They were initially so snug that they were uncomfortable to wear during my first few days of use. But as the headband softened over the course of two weeks, the headphones turned from “uncomfortably snug” to just “snug” on my slightly large head. If you have a chance to try them on before you buy them, I’d take it. Just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMT8KX"&gt;The Los Angeles offer a rich, rounded sound that has a lot of impact. Listen to techno, like the recently-released &lt;em&gt;7 Songs&lt;/em&gt; by Humanoid, and the thumping bass line has weight and impact but manages to stay just shy of becoming overwhelming. But switch to something more layered, like Bloc Party’s We Are Not Good People, and the limitations of this bass-first approach become more apparent. The Los Angeles just don’t leave that much space for the rest of the track to make itself heard, and in the case of Bloc Party’s track, you lose some of the definition and crackle of the overdriven guitars in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kxyx8"&gt;The Los Angeles don’t sound bad by any means. Far from it — they’re a very listenable pair of headphones. But their sound has a weight to it that can squash more delicate parts of a track. There are far worse headphones around for this price, but if you’re yearning to hear every last bit of detail in a song, then the Los Angeles aren’t interested in providing it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VobsJbIfXvpjKwtdrG5HoJ-Z9OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941385/jporter_211018_4812_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside the cups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pljpOR2P-x-EyDeBO0N47RN0suw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941392/jporter_211018_4812_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Los Angeles from the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ld2qSS"&gt;Making a pair of headphones that can be charged by light without &lt;em&gt;looking like they can charge by light&lt;/em&gt; is no small feat, and the biggest compliment I can pay the Los Angeles is that they integrate this functionality so seamlessly that you basically forget they’re able to solar charge at all. That is, until you look at their battery level after several days of use and discover it’s only gone down by 10 percent. The only significant compromise is the lack of a 3.5mm port for optional line-in listening. For some people, this won’t be an issue. For others, it’ll be a dealbreaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bNPx8E"&gt;As a pair of headphones, the Urbanista Los Angeles make a couple of missteps. Their controls could be clearer and more spaced out, and their fit could be more comfortable on larger heads. But they ultimately succeed at being a very listenable pair of headphones, even if their sound quality can’t compete with more expensive pairs from the likes of Sony and Sennheiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxjo34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="MSl2tK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10819567"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A new Facebook whistleblower has come forward with more allegations</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hPZW0DVy4s9EwCJ6wxbgMqlrltc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70033485/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dWyBao"&gt;A second Facebook whistleblower has come forward with a new set of allegations about how the social media platform does business. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/facebook-new-whistleblower-complaint/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the person is a former member of Facebook’s integrity team and says the company puts profits before efforts to fight hate speech and misinformation on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVQ0tY"&gt;In the affidavit, copies of which were provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the whistleblower alleges, among other things, that a former Facebook communications official dismissed concerns about interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, assisted unwittingly by Facebook. Tucker Bounds said, according to the affidavit, that the situation would be “a flash in the pan. Some legislators will get pissy. And then in a few weeks they will move on to something else. Meanwhile we are printing money in the basement and we are fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsTcMW"&gt;The whistleblower alleged differences between Facebook’s public statements and internal decision-making in other areas. They say that the Internet.org project to connect people in the “developing world” had internal messaging that the goal was to give Facebook an impenetrable foothold and become the “sole source of news” so they could harvest data from untapped markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jL0JUy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know from the Facebook whistleblower hearing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"},{"title":"Facebook runs the coward’s playbook to smear the whistleblower","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"},{"title":"The Facebook whistleblower hearing unearthed the danger of engagement algorithms","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"},{"title":"Mark Zuckerberg called to testify before the Senate following Instagram reports ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737081/facebook-instagram-mark-zuckerberg-testify-senate-child-safety-frances-haugen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TLYDa0"&gt;The company told the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;“It sets a dangerous precedent to hang an entire story on a single source making a wide range of claims without any apparent corroboration.” A Facebook spokesperson submitted a statement from the company without a person’s name attached to it, which called this reporting “beneath” the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;, and claims “At the heart of this story is a premise that is false. Yes, we’re a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people’s safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDXYxw"&gt;Many of the allegations by this whistleblower, who submitted affidavits to the Securities and Exchange Commission, echo the concerns raised by Frances Haugen. Also a former Facebook employee, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;provided internal documents&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; for a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;series of reports&lt;/a&gt; on the platform. Most notable was internal research that found Facebook was aware its Instagram platform was toxic for teenagers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pPOWN"&gt;Haugen&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt; testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on October 5th that Facebook had “repeatedly” misled the public about “what its own research reveals about the safety of children and the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems as a role in spreading divisive and extreme messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDE9qJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 22nd, 8:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added response from a Facebook spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s research shows that its algorithm favors conservative views</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VcG6ocSRSKqO2-WYqDaVkZjUtgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70033440/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p76pcI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/rml-politicalcontent"&gt;A post on Twitter’s blog&lt;/a&gt; reveals that Twitter’s algorithm promotes right-leaning content more often than left — but the reasons for that remain unclear. The findings drew from &lt;a href="https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/blog-twitter/official/en_us/company/2021/rml/Algorithmic-Amplification-of-Politics-on-Twitter.pdf"&gt;an internal study&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter’s algorithmic amplification of political content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8et0CA"&gt;During the study, Twitter looked at millions of tweets posted between April 1st and August 15th, 2020. These tweets were from news outlets and elected officials in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, the UK, and the US. In all countries studied, except Germany, Twitter found that right-leaning accounts “receive more algorithmic amplification than the political left.” It also discovered that right-leaning content from news outlets benefit from the same bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5TOEW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Negative posts about political outgroups tend to receive much more engagement on Facebook and Twitter”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aGdxfp"&gt;Twitter says that it doesn’t know why the data suggests its algorithm favors right-leaning content, noting that it’s “a significantly more difficult question to answer as it is a product of the interactions between people and the platform.” However, it may not be a problem with Twitter’s algorithm specifically — &lt;a href="https://stevenrathje.com/"&gt;Steve Rathje&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. candidate who studies social media, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/26/e2024292118"&gt;published the results of his research&lt;/a&gt; that explains how divisive content about political outgroups is more likely to go viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75qvhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Rathje to get his thoughts about Twitter’s findings. “In our study, we also were interested in what kind of content is amplified on social media and found a consistent trend: negative posts about political outgroups tend to receive much more engagement on Facebook and Twitter,” Rathje stated. “In other words, if a Democrat is negative about a Republican (or vice versa), this kind of content will usually receive more engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvPG3x"&gt;If we take Rathje’s research into account, this could mean that right-leaning posts on Twitter successfully spark more outrage, resulting in amplification. Perhaps Twitter’s algorithm issue is tied to promoting toxic tweeting more than a specific political bias. And as we mentioned earlier, Twitter’s research said that Germany was the only country that didn’t experience the right-leaning algorithm bias. It could be related to Germany’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/16/10287498/facebook-twitter-google-hate-speech-germany"&gt; agreement with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to remove hate speech&lt;/a&gt; within 24 hours. Some users even &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/hide-nazis-with-this-twitter-setting-1819414520"&gt;change their country to Germany on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Nazi imagery from appearing on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, Twitter began testing a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;that warns users when they’re about to post a rude reply&lt;/a&gt;, and just this year, Twitter started piloting a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713211/twitter-pre-tweet-prompt-fight-intense-conversation"&gt;message that appears when it thinks you’re getting into a heated Twitter fight&lt;/a&gt;. These are signs of how much Twitter already knows about problems with bullying and hateful posts on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSSDeK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;Frances Haugen, the whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; who leaked a number of internal documents from Facebook, claims that Facebook’s algorithm favors hate speech and divisive content. Twitter could easily be in the same position but is openly sharing some of the internal data examinations before there’s a possibility of a leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBMXnS"&gt;Rathje pointed out &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-63985-001"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; that found moral outrage amplified viral posts from both liberal and conservative viewpoints but was more successful coming from conservatives. He says that when it comes to features like the algorithmic promotion that lead to social media virality, “further research should be done to examine whether these features help explain the amplification of right-wing content on Twitter.” If the platform digs into the problem further and opens up access to other researchers, it might get a better handle on the divisive content at the heart of this issue. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft angers the .NET open source community with a controversial decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fgo2brSQUmLMN_p_fbL_22kE_CA=/132x0:1512x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70033204/microsoft_heart_open_source.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vjA5r"&gt;Microsoft has spent the past 10 years embracing open-source software and, at several points, even admitting it loves Linux and the open source community. The Linux Foundation even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13651940/microsoft-linux-foundation-membership"&gt;praised Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for working with the open source community after the company joined the foundation nearly five years ago. All of this goodwill could be about to come crashing down, thanks to a storm that’s brewing in the .NET community — Microsoft’s flagship development toolkit and core software framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGRuS9"&gt;A controversial business decision inside Microsoft has left many questioning the company’s commitment to open source. Multiple sources at Microsoft tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has also angered lots of developers inside the company but that they’ve effectively been told not to complain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Satya Nadella loves Linux" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F9jvsSsm_IUrf2hQ6oVnZ9cwGWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7105443/microsoftloveslinux.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has declared its love for Linux in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zRUIPp"&gt;Microsoft has quietly removed a key part of Hot Reload in the upcoming release of .NET 6 this week, a feature that essentially allows developers to get instant feedback when they’re creating a project and change code to immediately see the results. It’s a big selling point for Google’s rival Dart programming language and Flutter toolkit, and Microsoft has been playing catchup to bring it to .NET and Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOhssB"&gt;Microsoft described its original plans as “an ambitious project to bring Hot Reload to as many .NET developers as possible,” but a last-minute change has left it mainly limited to Windows and Visual Studio developers instead of being open and available across multiple platforms. Microsoft has been testing near-final “Release Candidate” versions of .NET 6 that allowed developers to use Hot Reload across a variety of environments and platforms with dotnet watch, including the popular Visual Studio Code development environment. A Release Candidate generally means Microsoft considers it production-ready, feature-complete, and that people should just beware of bugs before it’s fully released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zpS6Md"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft really does love Linux ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12926288/microsoft-really-does-love-linux"},{"title":"Microsoft: we were wrong about open source ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262103/microsoft-open-source-linux-history-wrong-statement"},{"title":"Microsoft will ship a full Linux kernel in Windows 10","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18534687/microsoft-windows-10-linux-kernel-feature"},{"title":"Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation, 15 years after Ballmer called it ‘cancer’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/16/13651940/microsoft-linux-foundation-membership"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wfWLYo"&gt;But a last-minute change &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/update-on-net-hot-reload-progress-and-visual-studio-2022-highlights/"&gt;announced earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; means Microsoft “will enable Hot Reload functionality only through Visual Studio 2022 so we can focus on providing the best experiences to the most users.” Dmitry Lyalin, a program manager working on the Hot Reload feature at Microsoft, says the company “had to prioritize” and dropped Hot Reload as a feature of the dotnet watch tool as a result. &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22247"&gt;A thread on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; questioning the removal highlights the community frustration, alongside &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28952502"&gt;comments on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft’s own blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E7SSsm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry for any confusion. To clarify, given the number of scenarios we are working on, we had to prioritize :(. As a result, Hot Reload will not release as a feature of dotnet watch tool. We are doubling down on VS 2022 with support for VS4Mac coming later&lt;/p&gt;— Dmitry Lyalin (@LyalinDotCom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LyalinDotCom/status/1451255736651026442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jm5CEG"&gt;“It’s even more disappointing looking at the source code to see that support for it was ~1-2k lines of code, and that code has now been ripped out at the last moment,” says Phillip Carter, a former Microsoft employee on the company’s F# team, in a comment on Microsoft’s blog post. “This is a clear backslide, especially because hot reload did not start out as being only for Visual Studio. I really hope this isn’t the start of a pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP3HaW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; understands that the decision to remove the functionality from .NET 6 was made by Julia Liuson, the head of Microsoft’s developer division. Sources describe the move as a business-led decision, and it’s clear the company thought it would fly under the radar and not generate a backlash. Engineers at Microsoft that have worked on .NET for years with the open source community feel betrayed and fear the decision will have lasting effects on Microsoft’s open source efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XmQ1f"&gt;“If you want a good developer experience, you’re forced to use Visual Studio — which seems to go against all of the .NET team’s cross-platform efforts,” says Reilly Wood, an independent developer who originally raised the removal issue on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9CbIx"&gt;The decision also comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/05/microsoft_net_foundation_under_fire/"&gt;weeks of unrest in the .NET community over Microsoft’s involvement in the .NET Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The foundation was created in 2014 when Microsoft made .NET open source, and it’s supposed to be an independent organization that exists to improve open source software development and collaboration for .NET. A resigning board member questioned the role of the .NET Foundation recently, asking whether it’s “here to enforce Microsoft’s will on .NET Open Source, or are you here to help foster and promote a healthy community?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFG742"&gt;Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217"&gt;locked and limited a pull request&lt;/a&gt; to remove this Hot Reload functionality in .NET 6 for dotnet watch. This effectively shut out the community from commenting on or rejecting the last-minute changes. The community has now submitted its own pull request to &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22262"&gt;revert Microsoft’s changes&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unlikely to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hfWMhK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In order for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dotnetfdn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dotnetfdn&lt;/a&gt; to move forward, I've tendered my resignation as Executive Director. I'm still on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dotnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dotnet&lt;/a&gt; team and look forward to continuing to work on my favorite platform.&lt;a href="https://t.co/Xn4ghK3vMd"&gt;https://t.co/Xn4ghK3vMd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Claire Novotny (@clairernovotny) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clairernovotny/status/1446548205437661188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ixrJGD"&gt;A recent controversy also led to .NET Foundation executive director Claire Novotny &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/11/dotnet_foundation_community_issues/"&gt;resigning recently&lt;/a&gt; and others &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/18/net_foundation_gnome/"&gt;questioning the independence&lt;/a&gt; of the .NET Foundation given Microsoft’s special privileges. This latest .NET 6 controversy won’t improve the storm that’s been brewing in the .NET community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0rTJA"&gt;We’ve reached out to Microsoft on the .NET 6 changes and .NET Foundation, and the company wasn’t able to issue a statement in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLqWXi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:18PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated to clarify details of Microsoft’s pull request lock on GitHub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA now aims to launch massive next-generation rocket on debut flight in early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/roX0b-INEJ8kBbdZKXl9zFVvlM0=/228x0:6492x4176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032885/51614473753_60838ac103_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA/Frank Michaux&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nOriAK"&gt;NASA is aiming to fly its massive, next-generation rocket, the Space Launch System, for the first time in February of 2022, a critical test flight on NASA’s journey to send people back to the Moon. However, plenty of tests still need to go well before the much-delayed vehicle can finally take flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJRIpl"&gt;Confirmation of the new target date, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/nasas-sls-rocket-will-not-fly-until-next-spring-or-more-likely-summer/"&gt;which was rumored in August&lt;/a&gt;, comes a day after engineers fully stacked the Space Launch System, or SLS, inside NASA’s massive hangar at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Standing at 322 feet high, the SLS rises taller than the Statue of Liberty. On top of the stack is NASA’s Orion crew capsule, a new spacecraft that’s been developed to carry people into deep space. However, when the SLS flies for the first time next year, there won’t be any people on board. The test mission will send an empty Orion capsule on a four- to six-week-long trip around the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="213oAr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;plenty of tests still need to go well before the much-delayed vehicle can finally take flight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3VjFff"&gt;SLS’ debut flight is known as Artemis I, the first major flight in NASA’s Artemis program. If the flight is successful, the SLS and Orion’s next mission will be Artemis II, which will carry NASA astronauts on a similar trajectory around the Moon. The program will culminate with landing the first woman and the first person of color on the surface of the Moon. During the Trump administration, Vice President Mike Pence challenged NASA to make this landing happen as early as 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7D0uuH"&gt;That timeline has since been called into question, given the complexity of the mission and numerous delays. Originally, NASA envisioned the SLS flying &lt;a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/20170515-anatomy-of-delay-sls-orion"&gt;for the first time back in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but its debut has been consistently pushed back again and again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;due to improper management and cost overruns&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, NASA also needs a lunar lander to bring people down to the surface of the Moon, which the SLS and Orion can’t do alone. The space agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarded SpaceX a contract to develop its new vehicle, called Starship&lt;/a&gt;, to take people to the Moon’s surface. But the vehicle still has a long road of development ahead, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632990/spacex-lunar-lander-contract-paused-blue-origin-nasa-lawsuit"&gt;lawsuits filed by competitor Blue Origin&lt;/a&gt;, which did not receive the NASA contract, have complicated the process. Then there is still the matter of developing new spacesuits, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618275/nasa-spacesuits-delay-inspector-general-report-2024-artemis"&gt;which could also hold up the timeline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7BfxV8urGL-EruRMB_GBQmuSg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22948354/51619125454_6f739e438d_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/Frank Michaux&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Space Launch System full stacked inside NASA’s Vehicle Assembly Building.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q6XKif"&gt;Despite all that, NASA hasn’t quite given up on the 2024 target date, even after Joe Biden became president. “It’s a stretch, it’s a challenge, but the schedule is 2024,” NASA administrator &lt;a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2021/05/31/its-a-stretch-its-a-challenge-will-nasa-land-on-the-moon-in-2024/"&gt;Bill Nelson said in June&lt;/a&gt;. Nelson also &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/bill-nelson-optimistic-artemis-moon-landing-delays"&gt;recently acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; the sheer amount of work and obstacles that need to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3riFN"&gt;For now, NASA is mostly focused on getting Artemis I off the ground. If all goes well, NASA plans to roll out the fully stacked SLS out to the launchpad late this year. Early next year, the mission team will conduct what’s known as a wet dress rehearsal, where they will fill the rocket with the same propellants it will use for flight but without igniting the rocket’s engines. Once that’s complete, NASA will then roll the rocket back to its hangar for additional checks before rolling it to the launchpad &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4fvls"&gt;“I tell you I couldn’t be prouder of the team that got us to where we are today, despite the multiple challenges that we faced with COVID and major storms — most recently, Hurricane Ida — and the impacts that had on our testing facilities,” John Honeycutt, the SLS program manager at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, said during a press conference today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyPTgj"&gt;As of now, Artemis I has three different launch windows: one in February, one in March, and one in April. Each window, dictated by how the Earth is moving about its axis and the Moon’s rotation around our planet, is roughly 15 days long, with the first window opening on February 12th. The timing of the launch within the window dictates how long Artemis I will stay in space, making it either a four-week mission or a six-week mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xrUo8"&gt;Once Artemis I is complete, then comes Artemis II with a target launch date sometime in 2023. For that flight, people will be on board, which means the vehicle will need even more additions, notably a life support system. NASA would not say whether the latest SLS delays have pushed back Artemis II, only that an update is on its way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsoDBf"&gt;“I think the agency is continuing to look at that; we’re evaluating the status of that mission,” Tom Whitmeyer, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development at NASA, said during today’s press conference.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch’s cowboy hero has a new name: Cole Cassidy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--h6enPf4ea6E-awxW5sfmnQRP8=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70032775/cole_cassidy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqBZ1Y"&gt;Jesse McCree, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s cowboy hero, has been renamed Cole Cassidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NcNaw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet Cole Cassidy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rides into Overwatch October 26. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CT6PmaNXNs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CT6PmaNXNs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1451624387732512770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lxGpiQ"&gt;The name change is part of a number of updates Blizzard is making to its games to remove references to problematic people or themes that have come to light in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;several discrimination and harassment suits&lt;/a&gt; filed against the company.  Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; removed NPCs&lt;/a&gt; that referenced former senior creative director Alex Afrasiabi, who was named in the harassment suit as participating in the infamous “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598508/activision-blizzard-cosby-suite-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Cosby Suite&lt;/a&gt;” incident. Jesse McCree — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;a former lead designer&lt;/a&gt; — was also a part of that incident and for whom &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s cowboy character was named.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5nUeU"&gt;When these allegations were publicized, casters refused to say the character’s name during &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League matches. The &lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;team later stated they were in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22638947/blizzard-overwatch-mccree-name-change-lawsuit"&gt;changing McCree’s name&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBBPLy"&gt;In a tweet, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team framed the name change as Cassidy coming to terms with his checkered past and giving up his outlaw name, providing a clever in-game explanation for a change that was because of real-world forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkTlky"&gt;“To make this new Overwatch better — to make things right — he has to be honest with his team and himself,” the announcement tweet says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAIqWH"&gt;The name change goes live October 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bO832x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
