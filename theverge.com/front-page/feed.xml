    <title>Charles Geschke, co-founder of Adobe and co-inventor of the PDF, has died at 81</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VwiPcv"&gt;Charles “Chuck” Geschke, a co-founder of Adobe who helped develop the PDF, has died at age 81, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Co-Founder-Dr.-Geschke-Passes-at-81/default.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxfoFt"&gt;“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an email to Adobe employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBaB1"&gt;”As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate,” Narayen said. “Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OC2Doi"&gt;Geschke earned a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and then took a job at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center where he met Warnock. The pair left Xerox in 1982 and founded Adobe. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, the programming language that helped boost the desktop publishing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyfgWQ"&gt;Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to July 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in April 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Warnock from September 1997 to January 2017 and was a member of the board until April 2020, when became emeritus board member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="po4biz"&gt;“I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner,” Warnock said in a statement. “Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edmzlp"&gt;In addition to his contributions to the technology industry, Geschke was also known for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/8a22e47c0a3f078f7b1df0dda117d634"&gt;surviving a 1992 kidnapping attempt&lt;/a&gt;. Two men snatched him as he arrived at work one morning and held him for four days, demanding ransom. He was eventually rescued by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kF8f3"&gt;President Obama awarded Warnock and Geschke the &lt;a href="https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/charles-geschke/"&gt;National Medal of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVM5Iu"&gt;“He was a famous businessman, the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world, and of course he was very, very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life, but it wasn’t his focus — really, his family was,” his wife Nancy Geschke, 78, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/17/adobe-co-founder-charles-geschke-dies-at-81/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGPkik"&gt;Geschke is survived by his wife Nancy, who he was married to for 56 years, three children and seven grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl10U2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal investigators looking into breach at software code testing company Codecov</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/viC09Q_VPWoKRM3g3UMuelnU0FE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69145367/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHEMKO"&gt;Federal officials are investigating a security breach at software auditing company Codecov, which apparently went undetected for months, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-investigators-probing-breach-san-francisco-code-testing-company-firm-2021-04-16/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.  Codecov’s platform is used to test software code for vulnerabilities, and its 29,000 clients include Atlassian, Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, GoDaddy, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpe8q3"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"&gt;statement on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, Codecov CEO Jerrod Engelberg acknowledged the breach and the federal investigation, saying someone had gained access to its Bash Uploader script and modified it without the company’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abORal"&gt;“Our investigation has determined that beginning January 31, 2021, there were periodic, unauthorized alterations of our Bash Uploader script by a third party, which enabled them to potentially export information stored in our users’ continuous integration (CI) environments,” Engelberg wrote. “This information was then sent to a third-party server outside of Codecov’s infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8zxiX"&gt;According to Engelberg’s post, the modified version of the tool could have affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z4l5g2"&gt;Any credentials, tokens, or keys that our customers were passing through their CI runner that would be accessible when the Bash Uploader script was executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OFJMsV"&gt;Any services, datastores, and application code that could be accessed with these credentials, tokens, or keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oydZff"&gt;The git remote information (URL of the origin repository) of repositories using the Bash Uploaders to upload coverage to Codecov in CI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="koXEdB"&gt;Although the breach occurred in January, it was not discovered until April 1st, when a customer noticed something was wrong with the tool. “Immediately upon becoming aware of the issue, Codecov secured and remediated the potentially affected script and began investigating the extent to which users may have been impacted,” Engelberg wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m8MWU"&gt;Codecov does not know who was responsible for the hack, but has hired a third-party forensics company to help it determine how users were affected, and reported the matter to law enforcement. The company emailed affected users, who Codecov did not name, to notify them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFx6J8"&gt;“We strongly recommend affected users immediately re-roll all of their credentials, tokens, or keys located in the environment variables in their CI processes that used one of Codecov’s Bash Uploaders,” Engelberg added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8osBIU"&gt;While the breadth of the Codecov breach remains unclear, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that it could potentially have a similar, far-reaching impact as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;SolarWinds hack of late last year&lt;/a&gt;. In that breach, hackers associated with the Russian government compromised SolarWinds’ monitoring and management software. Some 250 entities are believed to have been affected by the SolarWinds breach including Nvidia, Cisco, and Belkin. The US Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy, and Homeland Security agencies were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8wLYf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS3CMS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox to introduce content ratings for games to better restrict age-inappropriate content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roblox logo on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIiMf4Dx4vm3ChXjzIfSXT8sg7g=/0x0:4971x3314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143585/1232034013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qohKIu"&gt;Virtual gaming platform Roblox is developing content ratings for games and easier-to-use parental controls, the company’s chief privacy officer Remy Malan told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-struggles-with-sexual-content-it-hopes-a-ratings-system-will-address-the-problem-11618660801"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjUe7F"&gt;Half of Roblox’s audience of more than 30 million daily users are kids under 13, but the platform has struggled at times to contain sexually explicit content. Age-inappropriate games sometimes surface up on kids’ “recommended for you” lists, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdybR0"&gt;The platform’s current system restricts kids to specific games, but under the new system, parents would have more information about what kids might find in a given game; until you play a game, it’s not always clear that it might have explicit or inappropriate content in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mWaEs"&gt;Malan did not indicate when the new ratings system would be available, but said Roblox has a team of more than 2,300 people monitoring games for safety, and uses a mix of human moderators and AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CfrPz"&gt;Roblox, which launched in 2006, has been a runaway hit during the pandemic, giving socially-distanced kids a social space to gather online. The company reported revenue of $588.7 million during the first nine months of 2020, a 68 percent increase over the same period in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-shares-jump-in-public-markets-debut-11615402033?page=1&amp;amp;mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; went public&lt;/a&gt; via direct listing in March, and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that its users spent an average of 2.6 hours daily on the platform over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwg6n0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google introducing a feature in Chrome 90 to create links to highlighted text on a webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUclObS02E-f6lIvl6OO_Z-EiGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143488/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1h5rqm"&gt;An upcoming feature in Chrome 90 will allow users to create a link to a section of a website that they’ve highlighted. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295300/google-link-to-text-fragment-chrome-extension-chromium-highlight-scroll-down"&gt;launched as a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; called Link to Text Fragment last year, Google has now added the feature within Chrome itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDkFv7"&gt;The new feature is still rolling out to users; I wasn’t able to get it to work even after I updated to Chrome 90. But the feature works just like the browser extension did, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google product manager Kayce Hawkins: Visit a web page, highlight the text you want to create a link to, right click, and select “copy link to highlight.” A URL ending in a pound sign (#) is generated, which you can then share with others. When they open the link, they’ll be sent to the specific highlighted section instead of the beginning of the page.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rIW4W4nVsYNQKL1impKBHfGva5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22451590/keyword_highlight.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RmLbjN"&gt;An example of what the end result looked like using the browser extension can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288970/sony-ps5-playstation-5-announcement-analysis-graphics-games#GNaFeX:~:text=And%20that%E2%80%99s%20completely%20fine.%20Sony%E2%80%99s%20presentation,the%20PS5%20to%20be%20any%20different."&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt; (but only in Chrome and Edge browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jzpT"&gt;Google said the “copy link to highlight” feature is already available on desktop and Android devices for some users. The feature is “coming soon” to iOS, the company added. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has canceled its Lord of the Rings MMO game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/me-JBnz9kQj6mucoUGuDlYy9IXw=/65x0:761x464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143386/DOiAi2WUEAE3A1Y.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkE29Z"&gt;Amazon Game Studios has canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online role-playing game, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/amazon-cancels-lord-of-the-rings-game-announced-two-years-ago?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688736/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-athlon-games-leyou-free-to-play-tolkien"&gt;announced the project&lt;/a&gt; with Leyou-owned Athlon Games back in 2019, and planned it to be a free-to-play game for PC and consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsMYkR"&gt;The game was to be set “at a time long before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, exploring lands, people and creatures never seen before by fans of the Tolkien universe,” according to an announcement from Athlon at the time. But &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-14-leyou-shareholders-approve-tencent-takeover"&gt;Leyou was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Tencent Holdings in December, and an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to The Verge that the company was “unable to secure terms to proceed with this title at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m473iG"&gt;The team from the LOTR project will work on other games for the company, the spokesperson added. “We love the Lord of the Rings IP, and are disappointed that we won’t be bringing this game to customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NWInE"&gt;Since its launch in 2014, Amazon Game Studios has yet to release a successful video game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;canceling some&lt;/a&gt; previously announced games and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;delaying others&lt;/a&gt;. Its video game adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 got such bad reviews that the game was pulled&lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt; from storefronts&lt;/a&gt;. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the games studio had internal problems, including a culture that didn’t provide equal opportunities to men and women, and an in-house game engine that was “painfully slow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuRF67"&gt;But Amazon’s incoming CEO Andy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division"&gt;Jassy said in response&lt;/a&gt; that he’s committed to the video games division, which launched under outgoing CEO and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; later this year. “I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most,” Jassy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKDj2C"&gt;In the meanwhile, Amazon still reportedly plans to spend a breathtaking sum on a different &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; property: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;it’s said to be paying $465 million for the first season of its &lt;em&gt;LotR&lt;/em&gt; TV show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWXxxP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th, 6:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Amazon spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reschedules Ingenuity helicopter’s first flight on Mars for Monday </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDyRwtaZBWhzgcl2A7zVACIXDi0=/300x0:3876x2384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143214/ingenuity2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artists’ rendering of the Ingenuity and its parent rover Perseverance | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZarA9f"&gt;NASA has rescheduled the first flight of its Ingenuity Mars helicopter to April 19th at 3:30AM ET, the&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-attempt-first-controlled-flight-on-mars-as-soon-as-monday"&gt; agency announced&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY26kL"&gt;The four-pound helicopter that arrived on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Mars on February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; has seen its first flight delayed a few times. It touched the surface of Mars on April 4th, and has been undergoing tests and checkouts. It survived its first night alone on Mars’ frigid surface, passing a first test of its independence from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijL8wR"&gt;The craft was scheduled to take flight April 11th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;last weekend NASA said&lt;/a&gt; data from a high-speed rotor test showed the test sequence ended early, as Ingenuity’s computer tried to switch from pre-flight to flight mode The date was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;pushed back again&lt;/a&gt; after Ingenuity experienced a minor software glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS99Vh"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/290/work-progresses-toward-ingenuity-s-first-flight-on-mars/"&gt;decided to modify and reinstall&lt;/a&gt; Ingenuity’s flight control software, a process that took several days. NASA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1383221042504638464?s=20"&gt;tweeted Friday night&lt;/a&gt; that Ingenuity had completed a full-speed spin test and a decision about the next flight date was forthcoming. The little helicopter has been waiting on the surface of Mars’ Jezero Crater as NASA engineers tested and reinstalled the flight software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdiOyt"&gt;While Ingenuity is not the main focus of Perseverance’s mission on Mars— which is to look for signs of life and take dirt samples— the little helicopter could provide a leap forward in human exploration of Mars and other celestial bodies. Rovers like Perseverance can only move so far and don’t have details about what may lie ahead in their paths. But a small craft like Ingenuity can become like a scout, flying ahead to help the rover navigate Mars’ surface, and get to areas that other vehicles may not be able to reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4axju"&gt;Once it does take off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;Ingenuity will climb&lt;/a&gt; about 10 feet (3 meters), then hover in place for 30 seconds before turning in midair and descending back to the surface. The camera on its underside will take 30 photos per second of the ground. A larger camera will face the horizon and snap photos while in flight, and at the same time Perseverance’s cameras will take pictures of Ingenuity flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhGyUm"&gt;If you’re up for an early morning Monday (or late night, depending where you are), you can watch the live stream of Ingenuity’s flight starting at 6:15AM ET/3:15AM PT, on NASA Television, the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/live"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and social media platforms, including &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/NASAJPL"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/NASAJPL"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CPSC urges people with children at home to stop using Peloton Tread Plus treadmill ‘immediately’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Peloton treadmill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOQGEBiB-mCdYi35VFc16weimq4=/0x291:3000x2291/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142823/903922964.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qHhQF"&gt;The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Saturday &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread+"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about Peloton Tread Plus treadmills, saying the machines pose “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” In a March blog post by CEO John Foley, the company &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;said it was aware&lt;/a&gt; that a child had died in an accident on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9yzbK"&gt;The agency says it is aware of 39 incidents with the Tread Plus, including one death. “In light of multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product, CPSC urges consumers with children at home to stop using the product immediately,” the CPSC bulletin states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvtZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y&amp;amp;ab_channel=U.S.ConsumerProductSafetyCommission"&gt;The CPSC posted a video&lt;/a&gt; showing what could happen in a Tread Plus accident involving a child. It shows an unattended child being pulled under the treadmill and nearly crushed before he is able to escape (we’re linking to but not embedding the video because it’s disturbing to watch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFKtHQ"&gt;The agency issued a list of recommendations for users of the Tread Plus: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FjvQFG"&gt;Stop using the Peloton Tread Plus if there are small children or pets at home. Incidents suggest that children may be seriously injured while the Tread Plus is being used by an adult, not just when a child has unsupervised access to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPw7kq"&gt;If consumers must continue to use the product, CPSC urges consumers to use the product only in a locked room, to prevent access to children and pets while the treadmill is in use. Keep all objects, including exercise balls and other equipment, away from the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsxXYL"&gt;When not in use, unplug the Tread Plus and store the safety key away from the device and out of reach of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VL63Sd"&gt;Separate from the incident where the child died, the &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;CPSC received a report&lt;/a&gt; In February that a three-year-old boy suffered a ”significant brain injury” in an incident with a Tread Plus treadmill. According to that report, the child had tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill, as well as neck and other injuries. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;Peloton commented on the report&lt;/a&gt; at the time, saying the child from that incident “is expected to fully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJtk38"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a statement Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it refuted what it called a “misleading, inaccurate bulletin” by the CPSC. According to Peloton, the company had sought to make a joint announcement with the CPSC about “the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided” with the Tread Plus. The agency has, according to the company “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqupFa"&gt;The company told the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it did not believe a recall of the Tread Plus was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>During Indianapolis shooting, FedEx cell phone policy meant some family members couldn’t reach workers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CJzRMV"&gt;During a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis on Thursday, a company policy barring some employees from having their cell phones on them while working prevented family members from being able to contact workers inside the facility, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/shooting-fedex.html?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxyT7b"&gt;Authorities said the gunman, a former employee, fired into the warehouse killing eight people and wounding at least seven others, then fatally shot himself before police arrived. The incident began around 11PM Thursday and was over in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVaTcf"&gt;Tami Campbell, whose husband works at the facility, said she didn’t know what had happened to him until he called her after his shift ended at 10AM Friday. “I called his phone a thousand times even though I knew he wouldn’t have it,” she told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. And according to the &lt;em&gt;Indianapolis Star&lt;/em&gt;, many family members had &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2021/04/16/fedex-shooting-families-wait-employees-indianapolis/7250160002/"&gt;to wait overnight at a Holiday Inn Express&lt;/a&gt; to find out if their family members had been hurt or killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMkwq0"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, a FedEx spokesperson described the cell phone policy: “To support safety protocols and minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations, cell phone access within certain areas of FedEx Ground field operations is limited to authorized team members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BeMI4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter having a partial outage Saturday morning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4kJplUrnXfZcq1dnySFKdV5B-A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142133/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAkjEl"&gt;It looks like problems on Twitter that began Friday night are persisting Saturday morning. People on the east coast of the US were reporting that while the page would load, they were unable to send tweets and DMs. As of 11 AM ET Saturday, the site was still experiencing issues for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rG6yl0"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is, but Twitter said Saturday it was “fixing an issue” with its servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ylVPU"&gt;Twitter Support posted a brief message Friday night that it was looking into the matter, and updated it Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BV6AwV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know that parts of Twitter still aren’t working for some of you. We’re fixing an issue with our servers to get things back to normal soon. Thanks for sticking with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1383436102577442835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLAd58"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is. Downdetector, which monitors site outages, &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/"&gt;showed a massive spike in problems&lt;/a&gt; around 8:25PM ET on Friday. Things seemed to be returning to normal within an hour, but Saturday morning around 8AM ET, it was showing a small uptick in reported problems again. Often these outages are the result of a problem with an intermediary service like Amazon Web Services, but its &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;dashboard shows all green&lt;/a&gt; as of this writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVsQcZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://api.twitterstat.us/"&gt;Twitter’s API status&lt;/a&gt; website posted a message that its data team was investigating “a possible system irregularity currently affecting all Twitter API v2 endpoints starting at 2021-04-17 12:00 UTC. The presence and scope of any developer impact has not been determined at this time, but we will provide an update as soon as we know more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGxyU0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th 11:23AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds more information about the outage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is fighting a recall request on its treadmill after a child died last month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1AV52L"&gt;Peloton is resisting a request from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to recall its Tread Plus treadmill, which was &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;involved with the death of a child last month&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting tonight&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the incident, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Finvesting%2Fus-consumer-agency-to-investigate-peloton-treadmill-death&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22388707%2Fpeloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CPSC issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjp6m"&gt;The agency is reportedly planning on issuing a consumer alert about the Tread Plus and may do so as early as Saturday, according to officials who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post. &lt;/em&gt;One official added that “this doesn’t happen with other treadmills.” The &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; sources tell the paper that the CPSC is aware of “‘dozens’ of incidents involving Peloton’s treadmills, some involving pets or exercise balls and many of them resulting in serious injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eLrE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/peloton-ceo-says-accident-with-treadmill-led-to-death-of-child?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; this this past February the &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;CPSC received a report&lt;/a&gt; that a three-year-old suffered a ”significant brain injury. He was found to have tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill, neck injury, and petechiae on his face, presumably from occlusion of blood flow.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;Peloton commented on the report&lt;/a&gt; that the child from that separate incident “is expected to fully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96Et8p"&gt;Peloton CEO John Foley &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;noted the death in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th, in which he reiterated the safety instructions for Peloton’s Tread Plus exercise treadmill, including “Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJcqd6"&gt;“While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt,” Foley wrote, “each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfDmdj"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Peloton spokesperson writes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3WiKKJ"&gt;We are disappointed that the CPSC is mischaracterizing the situation. The Peloton Tread+ is safe for use at home when operated as directed and in accordance with our warnings and safety instructions. As a reminder, the Tread+ is not for children under 16 and children, pets, and objects need to be kept away from the Tread+ at all times. Peloton is 100% committed to the safety of our Members and we will always be open to working with the CPSC to implement impactful safety measures. When the Tread+ is not in use, Members should continue to follow the safety instructions by storing the safety key, which keeps the Tread+ from operating, away from the Tread+ and out of reach of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xFbIVy"&gt;A spokesperson for the company told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; that it “does not believe a recall is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNV7Ee"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a news release Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it didn’t provide more information to the CPSC at the family’s request —”until it was compelled by subpoena to do so.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GiqrH"&gt;According to Peloton, the company “invited the CPSC to make a joint announcement about the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided” with the Tread Plus, and CEO Foley asked to meet directly with the CPSC. The agency has, according to the company “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” The CPSC, Peloton claims, was “unwilling to engage in any meaningful discussions with Peloton before issuing its inaccurate and misleading press release.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSNKYU"&gt;At issue is whether the accident was a result of a poorly designed product or improper use — Peloton says that not only should children be kept away from the treadmill, but that owners should “store it out of reach of children” when it’s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pW1w42"&gt;In October of 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2020/peloton-recalls-pr70p-bike-pedals-due-to-laceration-hazard-recall-alert"&gt;Peloton recalled&lt;/a&gt; the PR70P Clip-In Pedals, because they “can break unexpectedly during use, causing laceration injuries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKDTLb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th, 10:43AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds new statement from Peloton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
