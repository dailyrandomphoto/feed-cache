    <title>Uber wants to make airport trips less messy</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-AVIATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RTIeadKhUmZT9MR9ClpxPuBXvHg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958412/1228126348.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2chbrg"&gt;Uber is rolling out several new features designed to improve the most dreaded trip imaginable: the airport trip. In select cities, customers can book a ride to the airport 30 days in advance and even send their flight information to their driver so they can track its progress in real-time. The company is also deploying machine learning to improve curbside pickups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UyKLN"&gt;As airport traffic steadily increases in the wake of the pandemic, Uber sees an opportunity to strengthen its position as the first choice for pickups and drop-offs for air travelers, as well as make improvements for drivers, who have long complained about the current chaotic system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FCcup"&gt;To start out, Uber is rolling out its Uber Reserve advance booking feature to more airports around the US. The company is also working with flight database OAG to add flight tracking information. When booking a ride in advance, riders will be asked to provide their flight information, and within 24 hours of a flight’s landing, they’ll receive notifications of any delays or potential early arrivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t0TqRr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;working with flight database OAG to add flight tracking information&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tYlG1m"&gt;Uber’s algorithm will respond to any time changes, adjusting the reservation pickup time automatically and informing the driver. And if there are multiple changes to the arrival time, the app will make sure riders are not bombarded with in-app pings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2xL9l"&gt;This is not completely new territory for the company. Uber Reserve, the advanced booking module, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21556948/uber-reserve-book-ride-advance-30-days-service-fee"&gt;was first rolled out nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt; in dozens of markets. Prior to that, booking a car ahead of time has typically been the exclusive realm of for-hire vehicle services like black car and limo companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3t2TO"&gt;In fact, for years, Uber argued that such features were unnecessary when a car can be summoned to your front door in about five minutes. The worry has been that rather than responding to immediate ride requests, drivers would be wasting time circling a neighborhood, waiting for a scheduled customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnKOmB"&gt;Now, not only is Uber going all in on advanced booking, it’s attempting to make it as luxurious and deferential to the rider as possible. In addition to flight information, Uber is also offering 60 minutes of complimentary wait time at no additional charge. So if you’re not quite ready to get in the car after landing, the driver will wait a whole hour for you. Riders may not see an extra charge, but Uber will be compensating drivers for the time spent waiting, so don’t expect this to be a profit-generating feature for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2TkCU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So if you’re not quite ready to get in the car after landing, the driver will wait a whole hour for you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TkwHcE"&gt;Uber Reserve is exclusive to Uber Black and Uber Black SUV customers and will be available at the following airports: Atlanta (ATL), Charleston (CHS), Charlotte (CLT), Chicago (ORD + MDW), Dallas (DFW + DAL), Denver (DEN), Fort Myers (RSW), Houston (IAH + HOU), Miami (MIA + FLL + PBI), Nashville (BNA), New Orleans (MSY), New York (JFK + LGA), Orlando (MCO), Philadelphia (PHL), Phoenix (PHX), Seattle (SEA), and Washington DC (DCA + IAD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIthhL"&gt;If you don’t like planning things out so far in advance, Uber is rolling out another new feature called Ready When You Are. Customers who request a ride once you land can choose to be picked up in 20 minutes, 10 minutes, or as soon as possible — depending on how quickly they think they’ll de-plane and make it through the baggage area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDsE6H"&gt;Uber is currently piloting this feature at six airports: Nashville (BNA), New Orleans (MSY), Portland (PDX), Philadelphia (PHL), Seattle (SEA) and Toronto (YYZ). It’s available to Android phone users today, with iOS coming in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENOQIl"&gt;And for those who prefer to live dangerously, Uber has a new feature to make spontaneous curbside pickups less hectic. The company is using machine learning to predict demand ahead of time and then dispatch a certain number of drivers who can then be matched with riders more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1PhYF"&gt;This feature is available at 15 airports worldwide: Chicago (MDW), Las Vegas (LAS), Los Angeles (LAX), New Orleans (MSY), New York (JFK and LGA), Philadelphia (PHL), Portland (PDX), Salt Lake City (SLC), San Diego (SAN), San Francisco (SFO), San Jose (SJC), and Seattle (SEA) in the US as well as Kolkata (CCU), London, (LHR), Montreal (YUL), Riyadh (RUH), and Toronto (YYZ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khcghH"&gt;All these new features come as the company is feeling more bullish about its financial situation. In a recent filing with government regulators, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687501/uber-adjusted-profit-q3-2021-pandemic-ride-hailing-food-delivery"&gt;Uber predicted it will be profitable&lt;/a&gt; this quarter for the first time in its history. Whereas the company previously expected to make a net loss of under $100 million, it now believes it could make an adjusted profit of up to $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeKEZb"&gt;With the easing of lockdown restrictions around the world, demand for Uber’s ride-hailing business has started to recover, resulting in an acute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;driver shortage&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Meanwhile, the company’s food-delivery business, while still unprofitable overall, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/05/uber-earnings-food-delivery-revenue"&gt;boomed over the course of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv8tg8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verge Tech Survey 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XWXX2_W2TVY4Kb4tZJd2CXgcb0U=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958423/VRG_ILLO_Verge_2021_tech_survey.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a year of the pandemic, we asked Americans if their trust in big tech companies has changed — and if the biggest ones should be broken up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="piUnNR"&gt;In a year of isolation, fear, sickness, and death, the tech industry provided many of the ways people stayed connected. It also made Americans very aware of their reliance on the major tech companies. So have our attitudes toward them shifted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83udey"&gt;Starting in 2017, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has conducted periodic surveys gauging Americans’ attitudes toward the major tech industry; our most recent one was published in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21144680/verge-tech-survey-2020-trust-privacy-security-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;the fall of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, just before life was upended by the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28OTc"&gt;Though the pandemic has changed a lot of American life, our findings reveal that it mostly hasn’t changed our feelings about tech companies. There are some exceptions, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Qb3RYv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790939"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LzvnWk"&gt;Thirteen percent of respondents who were familiar with the brand had unfavorable opinions of Amazon, compared to just 9 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zOybLS"&gt;The estimation of Facebook and Twitter also fell among people familiar with them — with 34 percent saying they had unfavorable opinions of Facebook, compared to 29 percent in 2020, and 42 saying they had unfavorable opinions of Twitter, compared to 39 percent in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gf8UjH"&gt;More people said Apple had a negative impact on society, but that was still just 9 percent of respondents familiar with the brand, compared to 5 percent in 2020. Facebook and Twitter were also more likely to be viewed as bad for society among those who recognized the brands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mulUXC"&gt;Among people who don’t use Facebook, 43 percent of them are avoiding it because they don’t like how it does business — a jump from 27 percent in the last survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wC4FNM"&gt;These are surprisingly large shifts in just a year. 2020 was a record profitable year for Amazon as more people relied on it during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ouXbO"&gt;We added a new company, TikTok, to our survey this year: 31 percent of people who recognized the brand say it has a negative impact on our society. Also, it’s the brand people most distrust when it comes to personal information, since 64 percent of respondents say they don’t trust it. Facebook and Instagram are the second and third least-trusted brands when it comes to personal information; in both cases, a majority of respondents indicated that they felt the brands were untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myig0N"&gt;There is also an increased interest in breaking up Big Tech. This year, 61 percent of our respondents said that the government should split up tech companies if they get too big; last year, only 56 percent of people said that. Maybe the pandemic drove home how much we rely on these businesses — and how they can change our lives at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIheF1"&gt;These are among the findings of the third &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Tech Trust Survey. This survey was conducted in August with 1,200 people nationally representative of the US. The sample error is ± 3 percent at a 95 percent level of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbKqT9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvAlm4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch source code and creator payouts part of massive leak</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Z_jM2k7TtmweZ5b4WO82eaSXHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958206/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_hate_raid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7CdT68"&gt;Twitch appears to have been hacked, leaking source code for the company’s streaming service, an unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios, and details of creator payouts. An anonymous poster on the 4chan messaging board has released a 125GB torrent, which they claim includes the entirety of Twitch and its commit history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL9yY3"&gt;The poster claims the leak is designed to “foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is able to confirm that the leak is legitimate, and includes code that is as recent as this week. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-entirety-of-twitch-has-reportedly-been-leaked/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported details on the leak earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TnFGO"&gt;The leak includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="pvYMHU"&gt;3 years worth of details regarding creator payouts on Twitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="37krkg"&gt;The entirety of twitch.tv, “with commit history going back to its early beginnings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jhlqcu"&gt;Source code for the mobile, desktop, and video game console Twitch clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yym8KC"&gt;Code related to proprietary SDKs and internal AWS services used by Twitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xfSJRt"&gt;An unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q57MdY"&gt;Data on other Twitch properties like IGDB and CurseForge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e04pQA"&gt;Twitch’s internal security tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MUIQWO"&gt;The leak is labelled as “part one,” suggesting there could be more to come. &lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports that Twitch is aware of the breach, but the company has not yet informed its userbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fv7qzg"&gt;The leak doesn’t appear to include password or address information on Twitch users, but that doesn’t mean this information hasn’t been obtained as part of this breach. In fact, the leaker seems to have focused on sharing Twitch’s own company tools and information, rather than code that would include personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DexmCK"&gt;We’ve reached out to Twitch to comment on this leak, and we’ll update you accordingly. Until we hear back, we’d recommend changing your Twitch password and enabling two-factor authentication on your account if you haven’t done so already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bs9pM"&gt;Twitch has been struggling to contain ongoing hate and harassment recently. After weeks of hate raids, some Twitch streamers took a day off in August to protest against the company’s lack of action. Twitch has responded to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters"&gt;#DoBetterTwitch movement&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a hashtag that the anonymous hacker has used today to promote this leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpNZye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:35AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Verge can confirm leak is legitimate, and we have included more details on the data within the leak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polar’s Grit X multisport watch goes Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Z0KhYhKsPyOzfB0ZCm3GBELcEc=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958059/verge_DSC_6507__1__2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polar Grit X Pro (shown in copper colorway) features a sapphire lens and rugged FKM strap.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oMNhJH"&gt;Polar is making a number of updates to its family of sport watches today. This includes the launch of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fus-en%2Fgrit-x-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Polar Grit X Pro&lt;/a&gt; for outdoor multisport enthusiasts, alongside feature and design tweaks to the company’s “premium” Vantage V2 multisport watch and Polar Unite fitness watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyklzd"&gt;The Grit X Pro is an update to the Grit X launched last year. For an extra $70/€70, the $499.90/€499.90 Pro model adds a tougher sapphire lens and a durable yet supple FKM watch band. It also adds Track Back routing to help you return to your starting point on unknown trails, Performance Tests to measure your V02Max fitness level, and quick access to altimeter, coordinates, and compass via always-on dashboards. Otherwise, you’re pretty much looking at the same specs as last year: GPS/A-GPS, waterproof to 100 meters, turn-by-turn navigation when linked with Komoot, and what’s considered to be one of the most accurate heart rate sensors available on any watch. Grit X watches will last for up to 40 hours of battery life in full GPS and heart-rate tracking modes, up to 100 hours by disabling some features, or up to seven days in watch mode. The Grit X Pro is available in copper, black, and gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbkoUn"&gt;If weight is a primary concern (rugged multisport watches are heavy!), then Polar is also selling a titanium version, which is 12 percent lighter for $599.95/€599.90 — a price that includes a second band made of leather. The watch plus leather band weighs 53g in total. That makes the Grit X Pro Titan the most expensive sport watch in Polar’s lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QP5rXbf8rWVsjq5zH1maDSijVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902072/Grit_X_Pro_Groupshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Grit X Pro comes in 3 new colorways as well as a lighter weight titanium model (2nd from left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SZvTge"&gt;Polar sent me a copper-colored Grit X Pro review unit to test. Although I’ve only used it for a few days, I can already say that the Pro model, like the Grit X it builds upon, offers a respectable mix of features for the price. It lacks some capabilities like on-device topographic trail maps and local storage for music that you’ll find on other multisport outdoor watches, but Polar’s latest covers most of the basics nicely. Uniquely, Polar’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polar.com%2Fen%2Fsmart-coaching%2Ffit-spark&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitspark workout suggestions&lt;/a&gt; are actually quite useful since they’re tailored to my current fitness level, goals, activity history, and nightly recharge score that takes into account how well I’ve slept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsgAkO"&gt;I also really like the weight, look, and textured buttons of the Grit X Pro, but I find the display to be less readable, both indoors and out, compared to class-leading sport watches like the more expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F641479%2Fpn%2F010-02158-01&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F6%2F22710376%2Fpolar-grit-x-pro-hands-on-multisport-watch-price-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Garmin Fenix 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. I like the texture of the FKM rubber band, and the durability looks promising compared to the basic silicone bands often bundled with other sport watches (I tore one of Garmin’s while mountain biking, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xzY39r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10790754"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wj3NLX"&gt;Polar’s $499.95 Vantage V2, launched last year, is the company’s multisport watch for those repulsed by the Grit’s chiseled aesthetic. Now, in addition to a new bright red colorway, Polar is giving the Vantage V2 the ability to quickly swap out bands to make this sport watch suitable for more occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOKqXwHqZBxVa47XcWbnPtjK3jI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902154/Polar_Vantage_V2_back_OHR_Grey_leather_Shift_edition.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New quick-release bar for bands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Fuzb"&gt;Today, the Vantage V2 is getting a $549.95 Shift Edition, available in silver and black, that ships with leather and FKM straps fitted with new quick release bars. Current Vantage V2 owners can buy a $49.95 Shift Edition bundle, which includes the quick-release adapter bars and choice of any 22mm Polar band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL67Xn"&gt;Vantage V2 owners are also getting a 3.0 software update that mirrors the latest additions added to the Grit X Pro. These include always-on dashboard features like compass and altimeter, navigation features to help you return to the start of your journey, and an HR sensor mode that uses Bluetooth to show your heart rate on gym equipment and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6Az8Niy6Pn1HaueWp26L_wmas8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902166/Unite_green.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Polar Unite and the sad reality of stay-at-home fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MtNVFc"&gt;Finally, Polar is giving its lightweight (32g) $149.95 Unite watch new red and teal colorways alongside a software update. The update trickles down features like weekly summaries and energy source (carbs, proteins, and fats) consumption estimates available on other Polar watches, in addition to the same HR sensor mode coming to the Vantage V2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATBkUZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The Grit X Pro tracks VO2max, unlike the Grit X at launch, with the addition of the Performance Test feature. The article has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD’s Nokia is getting into Android tablets with the $249.99 T20</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8jt3Se871mUBUNUDN1ivN2ONomc=/0x0:8448x5632/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958070/Nokia_T20_00000269_v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 10.4-inch tablet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PwFMTa"&gt;After years of focusing on phones, HMD is releasing its first Android tablet under the Nokia brand name — something we haven’t seen since the real Nokia launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/18/7239709/nokia-n1-tablet-price-release-date"&gt;N1 Android tablet back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlgrZr"&gt;The T20 is a 10.4-inch tablet designed to be used for working and studying from home. Pricing starts at $249.99 in the US where it will be available from November 17th, while in the UK the tablet will be available from today starting at £179.99 for the Wi-Fi version, or £199.99 for the LTE model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr2ss3"&gt;As you might expect from its affordable price point, the Nokia T20 is not a powerhouse of an Android tablet. It’s powered by a modest Unisoc Tiger T610 processor, and in the US and UK comes with 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of expandable storage. HMD reckons its 8,200mAh battery is good for 15 hours of web surfing, 7 hours of conference calls, or 10 hours of film watching.  The tablet supports 15W fast-charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Vxvc79hCHY_7GXfYTxTfl2g8k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902858/Nokia_T20_Emotional_Landscape.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the webcam, oriented for landscape video calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FWP4td"&gt;Around the front you’ll find the tablet’s 10.4-inch 1200 x 2000 display flanked by a 5-megapixel webcam that’s thankfully located on the long side of the display (better for calls when the tablet is in landscape). Around back there’s an 8-megapixel camera if you’re the kind of person who likes to take photos with a tablet. It’s got a dust and water resistance rating of IP52, which means it should survive a light splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnujti"&gt;On the software side, HMD says it’s sticking to a stock Android experience, which isn’t great news considering the lack of tablet-optimized apps. Other manufacturers like Samsung have added their own software features like DeX to overcome Android’s large-screen shortcomings, but HMD doesn’t plan to do the same. The T20 will launch with Android 11, and HMD is promising two years of major OS updates, and three years of monthly security updates. There’s no extended warranty here, like we saw with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;Nokia X20 earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JP2je1"&gt;In the T20’s box you get a USB-C charging cable and brick, but the company is also separately selling a flip case and rugged case if you want to protect the tablet from bumps and scratches. The rugged case will be priced at $39.99 / £39.99, and the flip case $59.99 / £49.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram gains 70M new users in just one day after Facebook outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEIeHxdQb9sqoku3-laLD-WU59k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958049/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNknxS"&gt;Messaging app Telegram gained a “record” 70 million new users on Monday, as Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;experienced a nearly six-hour long outage&lt;/a&gt; across its services, &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/170"&gt;Telegram CEO Pavel Durov&lt;/a&gt; announced. Encrypted messaging app Signal also reported gaining “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1445164521102979080"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt;” of new users on the same day. Both apps compete mainly with Facebook’s WhatsApp, although the outage also took down Facebook Messenger, and left users unable to send messages on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1ETGa"&gt;70 million new users is an increase of over 10 percent compared to the 500 million monthly active users Telegram had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480"&gt;as of January this year&lt;/a&gt;, the last time it reported a similar surge in new signups. Coincidentally, this last increase in users was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;helped by problems at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. In January, WhatsApp mishandled the introduction of a new privacy policy, leading to concerns that it would be sharing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;private user data with parent company Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Azn7m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For the new users I’d like to say this – welcome to Telegram”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AFwYiR"&gt;Although Durov claimed that Telegram “continued to work flawlessly” in the face of its “unprecedented growth,” he admitted that “some users in the Americas may have experienced slower speed than usual as millions of users from these continents rushed to sign up for Telegram at the same time.” Signal users were also experiencing issues where they weren’t able to see all of their contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EyVtSC"&gt;“For the new users I’d like to say this – welcome to Telegram, the largest independent messaging platform,” Durov wrote. “We won’t fail you when others will.” Telegram has long courted WhatsApp’s 2 billion users, and earlier this year added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253918/telegram-ios-chat-history-import-whatsapp-line-kakaotalk"&gt;import WhatsApp chat histories&lt;/a&gt; in a move designed to help users switch from the Facebook-owned messaging service. Over the course of this year it’s also added other feature focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551652/telegram-adds-group-video-calling-chat"&gt;video calling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651880/telegram-version-8-live-streams-video-unlimited-participants-flexible-forwarding"&gt;live streaming&lt;/a&gt;, although it still &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/telegram-encryption-end-to-end-features"&gt;doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default&lt;/a&gt; unlike Signal and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgZp6n"&gt;“Facebook-owned Whatsapp being down is a reminder that you and your friends should probably be using a more private, non-profit alternative like @Signalapp anyway,” wrote whistleblower Edward Snowden during the outage, “It’s just as free, and takes like 30 seconds to switch.” Snowden has long been a proponent of Signal, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E661313394906161152%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F11%2F3%2F9662724%2Fsignal-encrypted-chat-app-android-edward-snowden"&gt;said in 2015&lt;/a&gt; that he used it every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZL1BX1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAlNL6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest Renew could make your smart home smarter </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bU0JTETN52e0Jt0K0n-6X9FJQA=/0x90:3767x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957993/Person_Adjusting_Thermostat_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select Nest thermostats will soon be able to tell you when you are using green energy.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google Nest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GqvbPT"&gt;Google has announced several new features for its Nest thermostats centered around helping the smart home become a bigger partner in the battle against climate change. These features are wrapped up in a new service called Nest Renew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A194Cn"&gt;The service will use intelligent automation to allow the thermostats to communicate with energy providers and make it easier for Nest users to know when there is cleaner and / or cheaper energy on their local power grid. The device will then automatically adjust to use that energy at optimal times without you having to do a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ym1RA"&gt;Nest Renew is the “First program of its kind,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and it is entirely opt-in. It includes five main features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="F6Fcyz"&gt;Energy Shift — automatic shifting of heating and cooling to times when energy is cheaper and / or cleaner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5HlKBF"&gt;Monthly Impact Reports — a rundown of how clean the energy a home is using is, based on time of day, so people can adjust when they use non-connected devices to take advantage of clean energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lOXHrc"&gt;Energy Impact Program — an option to gamify your eco-friendly choices. Users collect Nest’s green leaves to earn a vote in how Nest directs funds to clean energy nonprofits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cSFjMh"&gt;Clean Energy Match — the ability to match estimated fossil fuel electricity use at home with &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates"&gt;renewable energy credits&lt;/a&gt; (RECs) from US solar and wind plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNfbiE"&gt;Schedule Tuneups — a new version of the existing Seasonal Savings feature that makes small adjustments to your HVAC schedule based on the time of year to optimize energy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4SvLD"&gt;Nest’s existing demand-side response program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540015/psa-energy-saver-program-smart-thermostat-adjust-temperature-heat"&gt;Rush Hour Rewards&lt;/a&gt;, which is an energy-saving program where the utility company can remotely adjust a household’s thermostat to relieve pressure on the grid, will continue as a separate service. People can choose to run both services on their thermostat simultaneously, with the Rush Hour program taking priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HemXGp"&gt;Nest Renew will work on Nest’s newest thermostats, which are the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, the Nest Thermostat E, and the Nest Thermostat. Visual indicators on the thermostat, emails, and activity summaries will tell Nest users when the various functions are active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ff1mGJ"&gt;There are two levels to Nest Renew: Renew Basic, which is free and will be available across the continental US, and Renew Premium, which costs $10 a month and is limited to select markets at launch (Google didn’t say which). The premium tier adds two features for $10 a month; the Clean Energy Match, which is a way to match the fossil fuel energy used with &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/what-it-really-means-when-google-and-apple-say-they-run-on-100-renewable-energy-f6d1719fd865"&gt;renewable energy certificates&lt;/a&gt; that come from solar and wind plants in the US, and the option to pay utility bills through Nest Renew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AFrZL8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Energy Shift is the main feature of the new program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WKOdIe"&gt;The main feature of Nest Renew is Energy Shift, and this is available in both the paid and free plans. This will automatically shift heating and cooling energy use to times when energy is cleaner and / or cheaper. Ben Brown, director of Product Management at Nest, explained that it will use small shifts — such as pre-cooling a house five or 10 minutes before the wind starts dying down or new demand spikes causing new energy plants to come online. “It will be just small coordinations based upon the needs of the grid that don’t sacrifice comfort at all,” he said. Nest customers will be able to manually adjust their thermostats if at any given moment they decide they’d rather be more comfortable than more green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7b3zxZ"&gt;Depending on where you live and who your energy provider is, the power coming to your home could be generated by fossil fuels during one part of the day and wind or solar at another. Google says Energy Shift uses intelligent automation to make adjustments based on forecasts of the type of power on the grid. It then adapts energy use to prioritize clean energy. The company partnered with the non-profit&lt;a href="https://www.watttime.org/"&gt; WattTime&lt;/a&gt;, which has developed algorithms to determine the marginal emissions rates of the grid in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtWPCk"&gt;Energy Shift can also adjust around any “time-of-use” charges your energy provider might have. Time-of-use charges are when you are charged more for using electricity at, say, 7PM — when everyone is home cooking dinner and watching Netflix — than you would be if you did those activities at, say, 2AM. Time-of-use charging is prevalent in Europe and the UK but not so common in the US — yet. But it is coming. Energy providers see it as a way to incentivize people to use energy when there is less demand, helping them better balance demand on the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kc02x"&gt;Nest says Energy Shift is a way its customers can navigate this change. “Certain regions are making it mandatory to move over to time-of-use plans — California and Michigan, for example,” said Brown. “Nest Renew will empower customers to manage their consumption against these time-of-use plans to make sure they can minimize their energy bills.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JoXwR7GK5gwMAgL7jz7bNBN3tUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903683/Person_on_Couch_Viewing_Nest_Renew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nest Renew works with a near real-time  dashboard to help users see the type of energy on their local grid at certain times of day, allowing them to adjust their use in response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tzDUtA"&gt;Time-of-use rates can be tricky to navigate. Running your HVAC system, for example, isn’t as easy to time as, say, running the dishwasher — which is something you can put off. Having a smart thermostat manage those calculations could make it easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCX1S2"&gt;Nest says it’s hoping to roll out Nest Renew to more household devices in the future, tying in with its smart displays and Google Home ecosystem. “We want to look at opportunities to empower other devices to coordinate with the needs of the grid; a good example would be electric vehicles,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9I4yJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://rmi.org/"&gt;RMI&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit working to accelerate the country’s transition to clean energy, analyzed the Nest Renew program and concluded that products like this could reduce around 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year if 10 million households participate. That’s approximately 7 percent of the gap between today’s level of household emissions and the US’s current target, which aims to cut emissions in half by 2030. With close to 123 million households in the US, the impact smart, connected homes could have on the climate change challenge will be even greater if even more people participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khdMXr"&gt;Nest Renew will start in an invitation-only preview in the coming weeks. Sign up at &lt;a href="http://nestrenew.google.com"&gt;nestrenew.google.com&lt;/a&gt; to join the list. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mKdvyf"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbHuSHGZf5U&amp;amp;t=0s"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a suite of new features that it says will help people who use their platforms make more sustainable choices. The new services focus on reducing planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions and are primarily found on Search, Maps, Travel, and Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0vVye"&gt;But before we get into the details of how their new tools work, a quick note of context; some environmental advocates have called out companies for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-change-focusing-on-how-individuals-can-help-is-very-convenient-for-corporations-108546"&gt;shifting responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for the climate crisis onto individual consumers. Holding big corporate polluters accountable for their emissions &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/10/business/what-can-you-do-about-climate-change/index.html"&gt;far outweighs any one consumers’ individual impact&lt;/a&gt;. And Wednesday’s announcements from Google aren’t really designed to reduce the company’s own carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zVfXIZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holding big corporate polluters accountable for their emissions far outweighs any one consumers’ individual impact.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XsQIvX"&gt;That being said, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;no time to lose&lt;/a&gt; to the prevent the climate crisis from getting worse, and every bit of emissions-savings helps. For those who might want some new tools to rein in their own emissions, here’s a breakdown of what Google just announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="axLetk"&gt;Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kYepoP"&gt;Sometime this month, Google plans to switch up the way results for “climate change” appear in its Search platform. Users will be led to a dedicated results page with “high quality climate-related information,” according to Google. It plans to source content from reputable authorities on the subject, including the United Nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwUbXw"&gt;The company also says it wants to make it easier for consumers to see more eco-friendly options when shopping on Google. By “early next year,” when users based in the US search for car models and manufacturers, Google will also show results for hybrid and electric vehicles. When searching for a particular electric vehicle, users will also find nearby charging stations that are compatible with the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox5d7U"&gt;Similarly, Google users in the US should begin to see suggestions Wednesday for more energy efficient home appliances when shopping online. That applies to searches for furnaces, dishwashers, water heaters, stoves, and dryers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kC7C66"&gt;Google, however, did not announce any changes to searches on YouTube, which is a big platform for misinformation and lies about climate change. Of the top 100 videos that pop up when searching for “global warming,” 20 percent of views are for videos rife with misinformation, according to one recent &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/26/21068473/youtube-climate-change-misinformation-epistemic-crisis"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by nonprofit Avaaz. Google has also not met its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948057/google-workers-climate-change-demands-letter-greenhouse-gas-fossil-fuels"&gt;employees’ demands&lt;/a&gt; that it cancel contracts with fossil fuel companies or stop funding and lobbying for candidates that derail climate action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bXrY1C"&gt;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pZcOMK"&gt;Starting Wednesday, people in the US can see which driving routes are the most fuel-efficient when using Google Maps. (The company originally announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357528/google-maps-directions-indoor-ar-live-view-fuel-efficient-weather-air-quality-layer"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; that this feature was on the way.) Fuel efficiency cuts down on both gas costs and tailpipe pollution. When the most fuel-efficient route is also the fastest, Google Maps will default to that option. If the fuel-efficient route is slower, the app will show users their options so that they can make an educated decision on which to choose. Users in Europe will be able to do the same starting in 2022, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAqdrk"&gt;That will, in theory, help individual Google Maps users reduce their CO2 emissions. A &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle"&gt;passenger vehicle&lt;/a&gt; typically releases just under five metric tons of CO2 a year. And a person in the US, which has one of the highest rates of &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/24306/carbon-emissions-per-capita-by-country/"&gt;per capita emissions&lt;/a&gt; in the world, might be responsible for about 18 metric tons a year. Google, on the other hand, unleashed 12,529,953 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in &lt;a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2020-environmental-report.pdf"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to more than 2.73 million passenger vehicles’ pollution in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Lite Navigation for cyclists." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2YNlIQ59h7WQ6sg-ZqITBqUam1k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903827/SWG_litenav.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Lite Navigation for cyclists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z36QHo"&gt;Wherever cycling navigation is offered on Google Maps, the app will feature “Lite Navigation” in the coming months. This feature lets bikers see instructions and details about their route without having to leave their screen on. And starting Wednesday, the app will share information about nearby scooter and bike shares in 300 cities around the world, including Berlin, New York, São Paulo, and Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OfKN5c"&gt;Travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jlmf7W"&gt;When searching for flights through Google, starting Wednesday, users will now be able to see the carbon dioxide emissions associated with each flight. They’ll even be able to see how their seat choice affects their individual carbon footprint. Taking a seat in business or first class increases the amount of pollution you’re responsible for, since they take up more space and therefore a larger share of the plane’s emissions. Choosing a more fuel efficient itinerary can actually cut CO2 pollution from a given route by as much as 63 percent, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588466/greenhouse-gas-emissions-flight-travel-climate-pollution"&gt;recent research found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DtzPT4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Choosing a more fuel efficient itinerary can actually cut CO2 pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sCcTFT"&gt;Separately, Google announced plans to expand its research into how to cut down emissions from driving by enabling traffic lights to direct traffic more efficiently. Google piloted the program, which utilizes AI, in Israel and found reductions between 10 to 20 percent in fuel and intersection delay time. It plans to bring the program to other cities around the world, starting with Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dKldYO"&gt;Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uWH27v"&gt;Google launched a new service for Nest thermostat owners in the US, which it plans to start rolling out over the next several weeks. It’s called “Nest Renew,” and allows users to automatically shift their heating and cooling to times when there’s more renewable energy available on the grid. This is a strategy that energy experts and environmental advocates have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419206/smart-grid-renewable-energy-power-sector"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; as an important step to making homes more energy efficient, and reducing strain on electricity grids during times of peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzXzAi"&gt;In “select” markets, Google will also offer a Renew Premium subscription, which would enable subscribers to match their fossil-fueled electricity use with some investment in renewable energy (through &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/9/9696820/renewable-energy-certificates"&gt;renewable energy certificates&lt;/a&gt;). To learn more about Nest Renew, check out &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://google-nest-renew-nest-thermostat-service"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to all the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B72SZ0"&gt;Google has been offsetting its own emissions rather than fully eliminating them since 2007, and has been able to say that it is carbon neutral since that time. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436228/google-climate-change-pledge-2030-renewable-energy"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; last year to run its offices and data centers entirely on locally-sourced carbon-free energy by 2030, a commitment that puts it ahead of the pack when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332461/apple-carbon-neutral-2030-climate-change"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437208/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-greenhouse-gas-pledge"&gt;companies’&lt;/a&gt; promises to reach carbon neutrality. Google’s data centers now run on 67 percent clean energy, Google Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canon’s new dual-fisheye EOS R lens is for creating 3D VR content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9N33hK1vdP9UfzNxpbz0UWvC5UY=/0x0:675x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957825/f5.2mm_f2.8_l_dual_fisheye_675x450_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PgRv0B"&gt;Canon has announced what’s easily the oddest glass yet for its EOS R mirrorless camera system: a dual 5.2mm f/2.8 fisheye. The fisheye lenses are 60mm apart and are designed for creating 3D VR images and video content; Canon calls out the Oculus Quest 2 as a potential hardware destination and says this is “the world’s first digital interchangeable lens that can capture stereoscopic 3D 180° VR imagery to a single image sensor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rezit"&gt;The lens can be used to shoot up to 8K footage on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318398/canon-eos-r5-announced-8k-price-specs-release-date"&gt;the EOS R5&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be the only camera it’ll work with. Canon is releasing a 1.5.0 firmware update for the R5 as well as a Premiere Pro plug-in and a standalone file conversion app called EOS VR Utility. Canon calls this combination the EOS VR System and will be making the software available on a subscription basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKr5Nq"&gt;The lens will cost $1,999, while the EOS R5 sells for $3,899. That’s a pricey combination, but not too much more than some dedicated VR cameras like the Insta360 Pro 2, and Canon’s solution should be a lot more versatile. The lens and software will both be released in December.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is making its 5G home internet $10 cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TVRFf_hf-nIVShjFGdeE8hw7pA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69957393/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2WAHy"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s cutting the price of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;5G-powered home internet service&lt;/a&gt; by $10, bringing it back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;the $50 price that it charged during its pilot program&lt;/a&gt;. That $50 a month gets you internet with no data cap, speeds that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fplan%3Ficid%3DHEIS_ISW_C_20HMEINTPL_4201BARY4O4BX5HPG23552&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile estimates&lt;/a&gt; will be anywhere from 35 to 115 Mbps, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Fgateway&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a router&lt;/a&gt; capable of turning 5G and LTE into Wi-Fi (which you’ll have to return if you ever cancel the contract-free plan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0snAV"&gt;T-Mobile is adamant that your bill won't be higher than $50 — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fhome-internet-big-fee-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its press release&lt;/a&gt; it says there’s no installation fees, activation fees, or equipment rental fees. It seems to view this as a kind of apology for all the fees traditional ISPs like Xfinity and Charter have charged. It’s pretty self-congratulatory, but it’s hard to argue that the service seems like a bad deal: I personally pay $80 a month for Comcast, and frequently find myself chafing under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;its data cap&lt;/a&gt; (though I haven’t been buried with fees like T-Mobile implies I should’ve been). If you’re interested you may want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fisp%2Feligibility&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22711794%2Ft-mobile-home-internet-no-fees-price-cut" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check to make sure your address is eligible&lt;/a&gt; for the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UPQgIk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At a flat $50 a month, the service doesn’t seem like a bad deal if you can get it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe7eVk"&gt;Of course, there are still some asterisks. That $50 price is with automatic billing turned on — leaving it off means you’ll pay $55 a month instead. Plus, you are still paying taxes and fees, they’re just built into the price (T-Mobile’s estimates that they account for 3-12 percent of your bill can be found in the fine print). The company also warns that you could have your service slowed down in times of heavy congestion, though some of its executives have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s “unlikely”. And, while there’s no installation fee, that does mean that you have to do it yourself. The company estimates that’ll only take 15 minutes. If you’re seriously considering the service after the price cut, it’s worth giving our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381885/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-issues"&gt;article explaining some of the potential downsides&lt;/a&gt; a read.&lt;/p&gt;
