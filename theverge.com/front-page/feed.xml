    <title>Netflix queues up a roguelike PC game to go with its action movie Kate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kate: Collateral Damage" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYqNg8SfnbM5EaMSdMOJa4jhzwg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905778/FAESDXVVEAgLmmT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage | Image: Ludic Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uz6WjG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first gaming tie-in we’ve seen for a Netflix original, but now that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;seriously entering the space&lt;/a&gt;, each title feels a little different. Developed by Ludic Studios, the new game is a “time-attack action roguelike” that relates to the movie &lt;em&gt;Kate&lt;/em&gt;, a Netflix movie starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead about an assassin who has 24 hours to find the antidote to a poison that is killing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1jvIN"&gt;The plot of the movie makes the game’s time attack approach easy to understand as players take over the central character on her quest. As its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623000/Kate_Collateral_Damage/"&gt;Steam description&lt;/a&gt; reveals, players extend the length of each run by killing enemies to slow down the constantly depleting timer, and earning stimulant syringes that reset it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP6DJN"&gt;The movie’s plot also comes into play through your hostage-turned-companion Ani and its grimy neon-lit atmosphere. Unlike an earlier Ludic Studios game, &lt;em&gt;Akane&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage&lt;/em&gt; leans into a &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; view, but comparing their trailers shows why the Brazilian developer was a good match for the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZsD8xB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5a_AvatAd7s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oxZClF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for release via Steam on October 22nd. There’s no pricing listed, but it doesn’t look like this game is tied to your subscription &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;like the ones Netflix is testing on Android&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, like the Eden Unearthed App Lab that &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3632378823549307%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently popped up on Oculus VR&lt;/a&gt;, this has the feel of a marketing tie-in that could help &lt;em&gt;Kate &lt;/em&gt;stand out among a slew of &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt;-like action movies with female leads that have popped up lately. Maybe we’ll find out more during the streamer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;Tudum fan event this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says new videos will be less pixelated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/33wiyGe-HoR2R0mu_kerGv5-pi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905758/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4R41TM"&gt;Twitter’s poor video quality has been a long-running frustration for users on the platform, but on Friday, the company shared some potentially promising news: videos uploaded to the service will now “appear less pixelated for a better watching experience,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1441475693863391232"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from its support account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7yfwo"&gt;Twitter removed a pre-processing step in its video pipeline when you upload, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which could mean that the fidelity of a video is closer to the original version. But beyond that, we don’t know much about what’s changing, and it’s unclear why the company is being so vague about what should be a change worth celebrating from the rooftops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1JW3I"&gt;App researcher Jane Manchun Wong uploaded a video to put the supposed improvements to the test, and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1441488893778415616"&gt;resulting video&lt;/a&gt; does appear to be less pixelated than it otherwise might have been. (The sound on this video is a little loud, so you might want to turn down your volume before you watch it.) It’s clearly not as crisp as a high-quality video that you might watch on YouTube or Twitch, though. And this upgrade only applies to newly-uploaded videos, so older videos won’t see the improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="37GQxI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;less pixelated videos huh. let’s see...&lt;a href="https://t.co/b6SBDnLnsc"&gt;https://t.co/b6SBDnLnsc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TrlZQJHSH0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TrlZQJHSH0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1441488893778415616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFw6Oy"&gt;That said, it’s promising to see that Twitter is putting some effort behind improving its video experience. And the upgrades may extend past video quality, as earlier this week, Wong’s research suggested that Twitter is also working on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1440094616980578306"&gt;video playback speed options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XRLFEG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Twitter seeking input as it explores Filter and Limit controls on tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gY8xfAXW-F8VHr-Z0tmwGqMiGrU=/0x0:1654x1103/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905624/FAETvl9VcAo62_J.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YLEnGk"&gt;Twitter is looking for input on two new potential features that could give users more control over the tone and quality of replies to their tweets. Filter and Limit, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulabarcante/status/1441457192712818692?s=20"&gt;as shared by Twitter designer Paula Barcante&lt;/a&gt;, would intelligently hide offensive or harmful replies or prevent repeat offenders from replying at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dyR1G"&gt;Based on the concept images Barcante shared, Twitter would detect whether or not you’ve received harmful replies and then prompt you to turn on Filter or Limit. “If you have Filter on, potentially harmful replies to your Tweet wouldn’t be shown to you or anyone else,” Barcante writes. With Limit enabled, accounts with a history of offensive or “repetitive, uninvited tweets” would be prevented from replying at all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGR7vqapHT29IW9E4RXur8vPYhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22876139/FAEUnKCVgAEN_y4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Twitter’s concept, filtered replies are still visible to the person who tweets them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f6d7Ar"&gt;Twitter’s concept is fairly upfront about whether or not you have Filter or Limit enabled. In the case of filtered tweets, they still appear for the person replying, with added text that says: “This reply is only visible to you.” For accounts with Limit enabled, Twitter would show a warning explaining that “Reply limit is on” with a link to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDeu1ZW-4uLDDAwMgI7U1YdOSh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22876140/FAEUdlcUcAIHuvY.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter tries to make it clear when reply limits are on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="no03rh"&gt;Now since this — entirely hypothetical — process is automated, it’s bound to not be accurate all of the time. Barcante notes that Twitter is also considering letting users review the tweets that get caught in either feature’s net in case the user disagrees with Twitter’s automated decision and wants to correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4HoZX"&gt;In terms of features Twitter has experimented with as of late, Filter and Limit definitely sound &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;more useful than, say, Fleets&lt;/a&gt; (RIP). It’s easy to imagine enabling those settings could largely prevent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;the racist abuse highly visible users can experience&lt;/a&gt; on the platform. Twitter’s also looked at other ways to protect users’ experience, like adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654061/twitter-features-archive-old-tweets-hide-likes-remove-followers-plans"&gt;the ability to hide old tweets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558731/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-features-pre-announce"&gt;select who will see a tweet before you send it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhDh2d"&gt;Like many of Twitter’s experiments, these all sound like great ideas; now, they actually need to be implemented. Barcante didn’t give a timeline for when that might happen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to customize your Windows 11 taskbar </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIyYtF3JZA7beM4sATh_CNxbbqU=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905381/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BNEkZJ"&gt;If you’ve updated your computer from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may find that your taskbar isn’t quite as configurable — and perhaps not quite as useful — as it was before. For example, the old, familiar Start menu with its configurable Live Tiles is now gone. The search box is no longer within the taskbar but is accessed by first clicking on the Start menu — an extra step. (Although the fact that Cortana is no longer automatically part of that search box can be considered, by many at least, as a plus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFG6MC"&gt;Another thing: the taskbar is now permanently affixed to the bottom of the screen — so if you were more comfortable having it on top of the screen, or on either side, you’re out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9vb32"&gt;As you might imagine, Windows users are already posting fixes for at least some of these issues — as long as you’re comfortable tweaking your Windows Registry. For example, there’s one that purportedly lets you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lbh92l2OPM"&gt;move the taskbar to the top of the screen&lt;/a&gt;, and another that lets you &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/change-taskbar-icon-size-windows-11"&gt;change the size of the taskbar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpL8Ka"&gt;It’s possible that Microsoft will bring back some of these abilities in future updates of the new OS. For now, let’s concentrate on how you can adjust the current Windows 11 taskbar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5oxSxP"&gt;Pin an app to the taskbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xm0W0C"&gt;Pinning an app to the taskbar at the bottom can be a little — well, weird. There are several ways to handle it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="DuFnpG"&gt;If an app is running, its icon will appear in the taskbar with a line underneath to indicate that it is active. If you want its icon to remain in the taskbar even after you’ve closed it, then right-click on the icon and select “Pin to taskbar.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right click on an active icon and select “Pin to taskbar”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkWVFm4q0PWeQdKmmf3P_u9eiZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875740/Screenshot__34_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right-click on an active icon and select “Pin to taskbar”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="09hcS0"&gt;If an app isn’t running, but its icon is on your desktop, you can pin it to the Taskbar as well. Right-click on the desktop icon and click on “Show more options.” A longer menu will open up; about two-thirds down, you’ll see “Pin to taskbar.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hQjzy1"&gt;You can also click on the Start icon, select the “All apps” button, and then right-click on the app you want. If you don’t see “Pin to taskbar” in the menu that pops up, then select “More” and you’ll see “Pin to taskbar.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also pin an app to your tasks from the “All apps” menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6np8xh9IUC6f59MjCRtRConOfHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875750/Screenshot__36_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also pin an app to your taskbar from the “All apps” menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r03xsL"&gt;Remove an app from the taskbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E2JcFt"&gt;Most apps are simple to remove: just right-click on the icon and select “Unpin from taskbar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uxtIx"&gt;A few of the icons take a little more effort to remove. The Start menu icon is, as might be expected, unremovable. But there are four other icons that can’t be removed but can be hidden. The easiest way to do that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9xBEcg"&gt;Right click on the taskbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ux21Pe"&gt;Select “Taskbar settings.” (You can also get there by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Personalization” &amp;gt; “Taskbar.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KF2cGN"&gt;Toggle off any of the four icons — “Search,” “Task view,” “Widgets,” or “Chat” — that you want to hide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can hide four of the standard taskbar icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QiYYZmbY59G4ZdXo0G9DWK5dBv8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875769/Screenshot__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hide four of the standard taskbar icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1kOnJJ"&gt;Move your icons to the left&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gdcBIZ"&gt;Those of us who having been using Windows 10 (or 7 or earlier iterations) are used to accessing the Start menu from the lower left-hand corner of the screen. If your muscle memory keeps your hand drifting to that corner, you can move the center app icons so they are to your left instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSbuWv"&gt;Right-click on the taskbar and click on “Taskbar settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NEijmh"&gt;Select “Taskbar behaviors.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gsR825"&gt;Look for “Taskbar alignment” and click on the button on the right where it says “Center.” Select “Left” instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1yMLuh"&gt;Close the settings window, and you’ll see that the app icons in the taskbar have moved to the left, with the Start menu icon in the corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can move the icons from the center to the left of the taskbar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H-FgiO1ySPF2dpoOxTmo2SVJxg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875775/Screenshot__22_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can move the icons from the center to the left of the taskbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5N9RJr"&gt;Incidentally, the “Taskbar behaviors” section of the settings lets you do more than move your icons to the left. It also lets you automatically hide the taskbar (something that’s been a taskbar behavior for a very long time); show a badge on taskbar apps to let you know if, say, you have any unread messages; handle how the taskbar works on multiple displays; and show a clean desktop by clicking on the far right corner of the taskbar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Taskbar behaviors include hiding the taskbar and showing unread messages." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yd_Js0N3g_rBNpWrUNRAirK35N0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875863/Screenshot__39_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taskbar behaviors include hiding the taskbar and showing unread messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YdaFXX"&gt;Taskbar corner icons and overflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXqHQ2"&gt;While the taskbar corner icons and the overflow window aren’t new, I never actually knew what they were called before. To tell you the truth, when I first saw the phrase “Taskbar corner overflow,” I pictured a bunch of app icons flowing out of the display like Niagara Falls. Turns out the corner icons are the icons in the right corner of the taskbar — the ones that show the time and date, your battery status, your volume level, and your Wi-Fi status, among other things. The overflow is the little pop-up menu that appears when you select the arrow to the left of those corner icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRrZ8r"&gt;For the most part, the icons in the overflow window are meant to notify you when there is something that needs to be done — messages that have arrived or an update that is needed. This is also handy for apps, like Discord, that tend to run in the background; you can shut them down easily from the overflow by right-clicking on the icon and looking for the “quit” selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTnUzo"&gt;While most of the corner icons that come with Windows are permanent, some — specifically, the Pen menu, the Touch keyboard, and the Virtual touchpad — can be hidden. They can be found on the same taskbar settings menu that let us move the icons to the left; just click on “Taskbar corner icons” and toggle off the ones you don’t want to see.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The overflow menu lets you handle apps that run in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9I4VHcwITYBFbABqI0QfPPnH_fM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875820/Screenshot__37_.png"&gt;

    <title>It’s Friday, here’s the Galaxy S22 Ultra render that has the Android blogosphere abuzz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tPAqt1bFg8PNssyPiGSlNCBun-M=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905230/GALAXY_S22_ULTRA_5K4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Digit, OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pA0XYz"&gt;It’s Friday, it’s fall, there’s a breeze in the air (hopefully), and there’s fresh, I’d argue ridiculous, renders of Samsung’s expected Galaxy S22 Ultra to show you. The renders come &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1441426057316368389?s=20"&gt;courtesy of @OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-exclusive-leaked-renders-specs-61203.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and they feature a new Samsung flagship with what looks like a Galaxy Note 20-inspired body and back that... well you should see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBQsVb"&gt;Since deciding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;to skip the Galaxy Note in 2021&lt;/a&gt; — apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;much to the chagrin of T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;Samsung’s been seeding Note features across its popular phones. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; offer stylus support. If these new renders are to be believed, the Galaxy S22 Ultra will go even further. According to OnLeaks and &lt;em&gt;Digit&lt;/em&gt;, the new phone will come with the hole-punch selfie camera and candy bar shape of last year’s Note, along with stylus support and what looks like an actual stylus slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fLZ8ro"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sooo... Here comes your very first and early look at the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyS22Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GalaxyS22Ultra&lt;/a&gt; and its quite "unique" rear camera housing design! (360° video + stunning 5K renders + dimensions)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On behalf of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digitindia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@digitindia&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vBGM3WJfru"&gt;https://t.co/vBGM3WJfru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YDqfFrVGLW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YDqfFrVGLW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1441426057316368389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NW5kU6"&gt;The render of the back of the device is where things get interesting, weird, or bad, depending on your taste. The Galaxy S22 Ultra appears to morph &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;the camera “plateau” of the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; into an unmistakable letter P shape. Is the P for... photos? Pictures? Maybe periscope? There certainly seems to be plenty of room. For reference, the previous Ultra included a main 108-megapixel wide-angle sensor, two 10-megapixel telephoto sensors, and a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor on the back of the device. Who knows what the new S22 Ultra will fit?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ATuyJXVgnfueUq6vLwNSV-oIdbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22875857/GALAXY_S22_ULTRA_07.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Digit, OnLeaks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s hard to miss the P-shaped cameras, a little bit easier to miss the stylus slot at the bottom of the rumored device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sDJGdj"&gt;There’s some reason to believe this could be Samsung’s design, beyond it fitting with a general trend of camera bumps becoming big and increasingly... visible on devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;the iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;yet-to-be-released Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. OnLeaks has a fairly good track record of leaking phones, pretty closely matching the looks of both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395173/leaked-google-pixel-5-renders-specs-october-launch"&gt;the Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447011/google-pixel-6-leaks-renders-pics-specs"&gt;the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of refinement to a camera housing also doesn’t seem out of the picture, in many ways it’s a reduction of the S21 Ultra’s cameras: a corner has been removed. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t look strange, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1pRvJgZl0Ynhub4j7_nMUn0Zt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248961/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can imagine seeing a “P” on the Galaxy S21 Ultra if I really look at it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>US agrees not to pursue fraud charges against Huawei CFO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returns to British Columbia Supreme Court on August 18, 2021, in Vancouver, Canada, during her last extradition hearing." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQFgAPJZkOf73pWuG3orRdK7yi4=/0x0:6658x4439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903844/1234750724.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7TxP6A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-brooklyn-federal-court-2021-09-24/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-wanzhou-us-court-1.6188093"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported that Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou would appear in a Brooklyn federal courtroom today via streaming video and enter a plea regarding US charges against her. Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18128057/huawei-cfo-canada-arrest-iran-sanctions-violation"&gt;arrested the Chinese executive in December 2018&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of violating US sanctions, and she has remained there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18134938/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-bail-house-arrest-us-china"&gt;on house arrest&lt;/a&gt; ever since, fighting US attempts at extradition. Hearings in her extradition case ended in August, with the ruling scheduled for October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lrgI9"&gt;Meng was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;indicted on fraud charges claiming the Chinese technology and telecommunications company misrepresented its relationship with an Iranian affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, along with accusations it stole intellectual property from T-Mobile. The &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-charged"&gt;13-count indictment&lt;/a&gt; named Meng, Huawei, and two of its subsidiaries — Huawei USA and Skycom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKwrEt"&gt;On Friday afternoon, Meng pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors submitted a statement of facts (&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1436211/download"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) asserting that in 2013 she told financial institutions the Iranian company Skycom was a partner of Huawei while knowing that Skycom was owned and controlled by a Huawei subsidiary to act as its agent in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDDhgV"&gt;As part of the deal in making this admission, the prosecution says “Meng has agreed to the accuracy of a four-page statement of facts that details the knowingly false statements she made to Financial Institution 1.” They are withdrawing their request for extradition from Canada, and as long as she doesn’t commit any other crimes the charges will be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KMWho"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-reaches-deal-with-huawei-executive-11632494001?st=n81fv8iy9e669cs&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Justice Department officials under the Biden administration revisited negotiations that had broken down under President Trump. Its sources report that Huawei itself is not a part of the deal and will continue to fight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185771/huawei-trade-secrets-charges-federal-investigation"&gt;its charges of fraud and trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46hhwq"&gt;Spokespeople for the US Attorney’s Office and Huawei have not commented publicly on the matter. A former Canadian diplomat told the &lt;em&gt;CBC &lt;/em&gt;he expects her release would lead to China deporting two Canadians it arrested and charged with espionage following Meng’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIHHw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 3:24PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Meng’s court appearance, not guilty plea, and prosecution agreement details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dm5s3l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 4:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add details from the plea and deferred prosecution agreement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Huntsman V2 review: no need for speed</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast optical switches plus a fast 8,000Hz polling rate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dqPNOx"&gt;Razer’s latest keyboard, the Huntsman V2, is all about speed. It’s equipped with optical mechanical switches that can theoretically register key presses far faster than their traditional mechanical counterparts. Then, its 8,000Hz polling rate means it can report that key press to your PC nearly instantaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erzdnL"&gt;So yes, it’s theoretically very fast, arguably faster than most people will notice. But this speed doesn’t come at the expense of any other important elements of a modern mechanical keyboard. There’s RGB lighting support, software to customize the keyboard’s key maps and lighting effects, and — in the case of the full-size model — a volume wheel and dedicated media controls. But Razer has also made some choices with the linear switches in particular, that means that the Huntsman V2 might not be to every gamer’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxoRz4"&gt;The new Huntsman V2 comes in at four different price points depending on whether you want a numpad, and whether you like your switches clicky or linear. The tenkeyless model starts at $149.99 with clicky switches, or $159.99 with linear, while the full-size model is $189.99 or $199.99. That’s relatively expensive by off-the-shelf mechanical keyboard standards, meaning the Huntsman V2 has a lot to prove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QZ8OkA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10771009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Dp5Asm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10771013"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gu539g"&gt;I’ve been testing two of the variants for this review, a Razer Huntsman V2 with clicky switches and a Razer Huntsman V2 Tenkeyless (aka TKL) with linear switches, both with a UK layout (US is also available). The latter comes without a numpad, volume wheel, or media keys. But the core functionality of both keyboards are identical, including their switch options, polling rate, and construction, so it makes sense to talk about them as a pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihFwlR"&gt;I’ve never been much of a fan of Razer’s bright green and black gamer aesthetic, but I was pleasantly surprised with how understated Huntsman V2 keyboards are beneath their rainbow-colored RGB lighting, which is easily disabled in their settings. Both the TKL and the full-size models are plain black, and their keycaps use a nice neutral font for their lettering. Only the TKL model actually has any visible Razer branding, and even then it’s limited to a lettermark subtly printed above the arrow keys. On the full-size model, this space is taken up with indicator LEDs for things like caps lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeNTRN"&gt;This space-efficient design means that both keyboards are relatively compact considering their layouts. There’s no large forehead here like you’ll see on Corsair’s keyboards: the footprint of both Huntsman V2s is just a little bigger than the keyboard layouts they contain. Razer does include a wrist rest with both boards — a soft cushion of fake leather — which increases their footprint a little, but I think it’s a worthwhile addition. The USB cable is removable on the TKL and uses a standard Type-C connector on the keyboard end. It’s weirdly (and annoyingly) fixed in place on the full-size model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eq6j5C0SZpSm5OzrmD1quWjtbac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869984/jporter_210920_4765_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full-size board comes equipped with a volume wheel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImA20W"&gt;The keycaps are made from relatively thin PBT plastic and use a double-shot design for their lettering, which allows their backlighting to shine through and should prove durable over time. All the keys here are standard sizes, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding aftermarket keycaps if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlDDcB"&gt;The exception to this otherwise understated look is the keyboards’ RGB lighting, which by default cycles through a kaleidoscopic rainbow of colors. I far prefer an all-white color-scheme, and it was a simple matter of customizing this using Razer’s Synapse software. Using this software involves agreeing to Razer’s terms of service, but you can use it in guest mode if you’d rather not create a Razer account. Like Razer’s other products, this lighting can sync with various compatible games if you so choose. Its software also allows for the keyboard’s keys to be remapped, and for the most part it’ll remember these changes if you plug it into a different computer, although there are exceptions like lighting profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dhm4of"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its double-shot PBT keycaps should be durable over time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GerB5i"&gt;Neither keyboard feels flimsy with little to no flex, but they lack the weight and heft of keyboards like the Keychron Q1. I think that’s only likely to matter if you want a heavy keyboard for the sake of having a heavy keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPXoNY"&gt;Razer’s big selling point for the Huntsman V2 lineup, and its big upgrade over its predecessor, is its 8,000kHz polling rate, which means that the keyboard is checking for key presses and reporting them back to your computer 8,000 times a second. That’s eight times faster than the original Huntsman and most other keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/je0t-yz6GxAo2ZNFaFlhJi4Px6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869982/jporter_210920_4765_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The switches should be compatible with most keycaps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3tr0GGsTGOVBQV_lv9cVK0U3rw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869981/jporter_210920_4765_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is sturdy, though not particularly heavy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LAg2QX"&gt;We’ve seen other keyboards offer similarly high polling rates like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=corsair+keyboard+review+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;oq=corsair+keyboard+review+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;aqs=edge..69i57.3095j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Corsair’s K70 RGB TKL&lt;/a&gt;, but Razer’s Hunstman has a couple of theoretical advantages. First off, while Corsair’s recent keyboard reports over USB at 8,000Hz, it’s actually only internally scanning for key presses at 4,000Hz. In contrast, Razer tells me the Huntsman V2’s entire stack is 8,000Hz, which should give it a small advantage in responsiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Voi8D4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I struggled to notice the responsiveness in practice&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWJku7"&gt;But more importantly, the Huntsman V2, like the Huntsman before it, uses optical mechanical switches. That means they use a small beam of light to detect when a key has been pressed, rather than using metallic contacts as with Cherry’s traditional MX switch design. This solves a problem with mechanical switches where the contacts can “bounce” together before making final contact. It’s something that only happens for a fraction of a second, but it means that traditional mechanical keyboards suffer from a “debounce delay” while they work out whether a keypress has actually happened. Optical switches don’t have this problem. So in the case of the Huntsman V2, you should be able to press a switch and have it report back to your machine with almost no latency, according to Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvWyY8"&gt;That’s the theory, but while I wish I could say that I feel the difference, I struggled to notice it in practice. I played around 10 hours of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; on the Huntsman V2 with my frame rate at a more or less stable 90fps and struggled to notice any improvements in latency compared with my usual 1,000Hz Filco Majestouch 2 keyboard. That’s not to say there wasn’t an objective difference in latency. Filming myself hitting the spacebar in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; in slow-mo at 240fps with the game running at 100fps showed that the Huntsman V2 does indeed have a faster response time. It just wasn’t acute enough for me to feel in practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DLiZGummfghTdgPn9_SGhtpJvrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869985/jporter_210920_4765_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only the Tenkeyless model has a detachable USB-C cable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzOwFr"&gt;That said, these results will vary a lot depending on the kinds of games you play, and the frame rates they run at on your machine. So if you’re a fan of playing esports titles on a 240Hz or even 360Hz monitor, and have faster reflexes, then it could make more of a difference. But, for me, the difference was negligible. For most people, I don’t think the 8,000Hz refresh rate makes enough of a difference to warrant recommending the Huntsman V2 over an otherwise similarly specced competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jXozmO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard’s clicky and linear switch options are very different&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vKV8lQ"&gt;It’s at this point that I’d normally quickly outline the switch options of a keyboard and tell you to follow your heart: whether that be to smooth linear switches, bumpy tactiles, or clicky… clicky switches. But it’s not that simple with the Huntsman V2, which is available with either clicky or linear switch options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R6jox"&gt;Yes, both switches share a lot of the same fundamentals. They’re both optical, obviously, and both have stabilizer bars built into each and every switch, which Razer says is to cut down on the amount of moving parts. But the linear switches specifically have been updated since the original Huntsman, and now have a built in “silicon sound dampener.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UBjkFc2h2l_4mCPqw-00BeO_XiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869976/jporter_210920_4765_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s linear optical switches now come equipped with a silicon sound dampener.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4TKCF53oPAjvFfwGQV6SH6n8vyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869977/jporter_210920_4765_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tenkeyless model is the more understated of the two.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib2efY"&gt;It means the two switch types feel radically different, far more so than you’d expect when comparing the clicky and linear options on another keyboard. And I don’t think the changes Razer has made with its second generation linear optical switches are necessarily an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzgaxF"&gt;That’s because this silicon sound dampener has a major impact on the way the linear switches feel. It’s similar to the effect you’d get by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamingrace.com%2Fblogs%2Fguides-resources%2Fwhat-are-mechanical-keyboard-orings&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22691381%2Frazer-huntsman-v2-review-optical-mechanical-keyboard-8000hz-polling-rate-linear-clicky-switches" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;installing rubber O-rings&lt;/a&gt; on a normal mechanical switch, only built into their design with no option to remove them. Yes, this makes for a quieter keyboard, but it’s at the expense of that crispness that I’d argue is part of the fundamental appeal of mechanical keyboards in the first place. It feels like you’re typing on a membrane keyboard, just with the improved responsiveness and durability of a mechanical keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRquRR"&gt;The clicky switches are better, but I still don’t think the typing experience is great. Although it’s not nearly as soft as the bottoming out feeling of the linear switches, there’s still a slight mushiness to the feeling here, and the keyboard’s stabilizers (the mechanisms under long keys that stop them from wobbling) have a bit of rattle to them. If you want a lovely crisp and clean-feeling typing experience, this isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hTA7b4KH-_P_hYEhygLpVtjZQPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869983/jporter_210920_4765_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the dedicated media keys you could need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IgA8H8"&gt;On paper, it’s hard to knock either the Huntsman V2 or the Huntsman V2 Tenkeyless. They’re responsive thanks to fast polling and optical switches, well supported with Razer’s software, and have designs that should work well on basically any desk. Each also has its own nice quality-of-life features, like a volume wheel on the full-size model and a detachable USB-C cable on the TKL version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pfQDth"&gt;But I think the improvement in responsiveness is marginal at best and only really relevant if you’re playing an esports-focused title at higher refresh rates. Then, when it comes to the Huntsman V2’s overall typing experience, it simply can’t match up to other similarly priced keyboards available elsewhere. It’s a very functional keyboard, but it falls short of matching this functionality with quality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney sues to keep its Avengers copyrights assembled</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/094KRpcgJcrnHH8TyXU7fla_nME=/7x0:4096x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904611/7845a8b610b38e85a4395b809d7764c6_4096x2726_322c95ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqpdzf"&gt;Disney-owned Marvel is suing relatives of Steve Ditko and other Marvel comics creators to retain control of classic characters, including Iron Man, Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Black Widow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLafA7"&gt;The lawsuits, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/marvel-suing-avengers-copyright-termination-1235020110/"&gt;covered earlier today by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, were filed in New York and California against the heirs of &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.567067/gov.uscourts.nysd.567067.1.0.pdf"&gt;Steve Ditko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.832358/gov.uscourts.cacd.832358.1.0.pdf"&gt;Don Rico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.567078/gov.uscourts.nysd.567078.1.0.pdf"&gt;Don Heck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.469853/gov.uscourts.nyed.469853.1.0.pdf"&gt;Gene Colan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Stan Lee’s brother and Marvel collaborator &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.567054/gov.uscourts.nysd.567054.1.0_1.pdf"&gt;Lawrence Lieber&lt;/a&gt;. They ask courts to declare that Disney has sole ownership of comics like &lt;em&gt;The Avengers, Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Amazing Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Strange Tales&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tales of Suspense&lt;/em&gt; — including the characters and story elements that have formed the basis for Disney’s lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSEmrJ"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; notes, the suits follow Lieber and others sending termination notices to reclaim part of the rights on many Marvel characters. They’re an attempt to head off litigation that might follow from those notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6BWkC"&gt;Termination notices are meant to let creators and their heirs share in publishers’ profits. But Disney’s attorneys argue that Marvel had sole creative control over the characters and comic books in question, saying it paid writers and artists on a work-for-hire basis that precluded any rights to the resulting books. “This case thus involves an invalid attempt, by means of termination notices ... to acquire certain rights to iconic Marvel comic book characters and stories,” says the suit against Lieber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PobUwN"&gt;Artists and authors, as well as their families, have fought repeated legal battles for the rights to iconic comics characters. The efforts have had limited success. In 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/business/media/marvel-settles-with-family-of-comic-book-artist-jack-kirby.html"&gt;Disney and the children of Marvel legend Jack Kirby settled&lt;/a&gt; a lawsuit that saw an appeals court rule in Disney’s favor, concluding that Kirby had worked on a for-hire basis. The same year, an &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2014/01/superman-warner-bros-dc-comics-copyright-lawsuit-668850/"&gt;appeals court affirmed&lt;/a&gt; DC parent company Warner Bros’ victory over the family of Superman co-creator Joe Shuster. And in Marvel cases specifically, the comics giant has cited its collaborative “Marvel Method” as an argument in its favor — saying it makes it difficult to assign ownership to a specific author or artist.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter lets you add Topics to Spaces, but they’re limited to start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkK2zaLlNDFBaxjB48Rce8JG-dU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904559/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2oTvpo"&gt;Twitter is bringing Topics to Spaces so that hosts can tag their Spaces with up to three relevant Topics, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1441438483717836802"&gt;according to the Spaces Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small addition to start: there are only 10 Topics to choose from, limited to English, for some people on the Android app. Twitter says it will expand to iOS and add more Topics and languages soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btNsuS"&gt;The initial 10 Topics — Business &amp;amp; Finance, Music, Sports, Technology, Gaming, World News, Entertainment, Arts &amp;amp; Culture, Home &amp;amp; Family, and Careers — align with the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20948547/twitter-topics-launch-sports-gaming-entertainment-test"&gt;currently exist across Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which people can choose to follow to get related content on their timelines. Adding Topics to Spaces brings it even closer to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; works, with different topics to explore and clubs to join based around those topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JAJ8wt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;new in Spaces: Topics!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;when creating or scheduling a Space, some of you on Android can choose up to 3 Topics to tag it with from a list of our top 10 Topics. BUT it’s only 10 Topics for now and we’ll expand as we build together&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;English only (also for now!), iOS soon &lt;a href="https://t.co/6PfbZtwWMH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6PfbZtwWMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1441438483717836802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="00vkpm"&gt;One of the nicer things about Twitter is finding people who share your possibly niche interests, so it makes sense to add at least some of its Topics to Spaces. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/topics_selector"&gt;several hundred available&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them get pretty specific: you can choose to follow the Topics for Dinosaurs, Bollywood Dance, Drone Racing, Unexplained Phenomena, and Adam Sandler, to name a few. (I’m losing hope that an Antique Glassware Identification Topic will materialize, but that might just be me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE72gG"&gt;Twitter has been steadily updating Spaces since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;started testing late last year&lt;/a&gt;. In recent months, it’s begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;rolling out Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and added more options for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640097/twitter-spaces-attending-listening-follow-top-of-feed"&gt;discoverability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;moderation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y14p4c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 5:00PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added the full list of Topics available in Spaces. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xhSBZJ"&gt;The European Commission shook the iPhone world to its roots this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;announcing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; that would require all smartphones to adopt USB-C ports for physical charging in an effort to reduce e-waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxSmPd"&gt;Apple, of course, doesn’t offer a USB-C iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;having argued to the European Commission in the past&lt;/a&gt; that “Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYvKqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple obviously prefers Lightning to USB-C&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc1No"&gt;Switching to USB-C, Apple says, would actually be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; wasteful than sticking with Lightning, since customers would need new cables and adapters — despite the fact that Apple already offers USB-C ports on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; and has managed to switch over those popular products without major issues or customer revolts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpyaTz"&gt;Notably absent from Apple’s argument, though, is the fact that cutting out a Lightning port on an iPhone wouldn’t just create more e-waste (if you buy Apple’s logic) or inconvenience its customers. It also means that Apple would lose out on the revenue it makes from every Lightning cable and accessory that works with the iPhone, Apple-made or not — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;control it has&lt;/a&gt; over what kinds of hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3801436/kickstarter-charging-station-pop-back-on-after-apple-changes-lightning-accessory-rules"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;) get to exist for the iPhone and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/3/3451032/apple-lightning-certification-accessory-restrictions"&gt;which companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;get to make them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhZP2X"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; means that if you want to plug anything into an iPhone, be it charger or adapter or accessory, you have to go through Apple. And Apple takes a cut of every one of those devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca7ugP"&gt;Want to connect an external display? You’ll need an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Import photos and videos from an SD card or flash drive?

Want to use a DAC to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple Music’s new hi-res lossless audio&lt;/a&gt;? Again, you’ll either need an MFi device or an Apple-approved USB dongle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsr815"&gt;The same, of course, isn’t true of Apple’s USB-C-based devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750137/apple-ipad-pro-usb-c-hubs-hyperdrive-belkin-satechi-kanex"&gt;which have a robust ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that can broadly be defined as virtually every product that uses USB-C. With a USB-C iPad, you can simply plug in flash drives and keyboards and displays and any number of useful additions that make those devices better. Apple even made a point of that fact during its latest keynote when announcing the new iPad Mini. And of course, USB-C iPads can be charged by any standard USB-C cable that’s capable of putting out enough wattage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjYAaL"&gt;The European Commission's rule could theoretically do the same for iPhones by forcing into existence the USB-C iPhone that Apple has adamantly refused to make thus far. But the new change may mean that Apple could shift towards (or accelerate its plans for) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;completely portless iPhone instead&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than give into USB-C ports, the company could eschew ports entirely in order to shift customers towards using its proprietary charging methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJVkbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FsqIic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;It’s the sort of solution that seems obvious&lt;/a&gt; — it’s practically an intentional loophole in the EU policy — until you consider how little sense a portless iPhone makes, absent Apple’s desire to defend its accessory fees and ecosystem control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmVHtW"&gt;Switching to USB-C, a standard that’s used by virtually every other major tech product (including many of Apple’s own, like its recent MacBook and IPad lineups) would make sense. The iPhone is possibly the most popular device in the world that uses a proprietary charger, and a switch to USB-C would simplify charging setups for the millions of iPhone owners around the world. And USB-C would still allow for similar waterproofing, data transfer, and charging speeds compared to Lightning (as evidenced by any number of Android phones or Apple’s iPads.) There’s a reason the European Commission is looking to institute the new change, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91pWVK"&gt;If the EU allowed Apple to stick with Lightning, keeping that standard around also makes a certain amount of sense, even if it’s frustrating to those (like me) who would prefer a more unified charging standard. Lightning is an established ecosystem that millions of customers already have cables for, with fast data transfer and charging speeds. Like USB-C, it offers waterproofing capabilities, and it gets Apple both its licensing fees and ecosystem control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz6m3y"&gt;But a portless iPhone that relies on MagSafe (or another wireless standard) is a baffling proposition. It would force millions of customers to have to switch to new chargers, generating tons of e-waste in the process. The result of all that cost and effort would be a charging and data transfer system that is slower and less power efficient in every way compared to wired cables, while also being larger and bulkier than a Lightning or a USB-C wire — just compare the size of one of Apple’s MagSafe cables, or the smallest Qi wireless charger, to a regular wired plug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pLiv34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could weather a switch to USB-C just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erbqvz"&gt;Apple is a $2.4 trillion company; it likely would be just fine without the revenues it gets from Lightning cable fees, should it switch to USB-C entirely. After all, there’s still plenty of proprietary Apple chargers and technologies out there to license, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, AirPlay, Find My, or the rumored new magnetic laptop chargers that may be in the works for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWMXCq"&gt;But profits aside, a switch to USB-C would mean relinquishing another piece of control over what iPhone owners can do with their devices outside of Apple’s carefully curated walled garden. And that, as we’ve seen time and again, is something that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;loath to allow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
