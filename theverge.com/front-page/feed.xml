    <title>Hisense’s 55-inch 4K QLED TV is cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uk-rhHqpNHmcxZk1MOqFmCVhlcQ=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936666/hisenseu6g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hisense&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PrxWBY"&gt;Hisense’s U6G QLED TV in the 55-inch size is discounted at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091Y2KLZZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfHiMbtsRwa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; today. Normally $649.99, you can pick it up from either Best Buy or Amazon for just $520. Its quantum dot LED-backlit display should offer better contrast and color accuracy than the many low-end models available around the $400-$500 price range. It has Google Assistant built in, too, along with support for a bevy of streaming apps, including YouTube, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and more. It has four HDMI ports and a native refresh rate of 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qJyVs"&gt;It might be of importance to you that Hisense includes this model in its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22675894/hisense-100-day-no-regrets-guarantee-promotion-tv-8k-laser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 Day No Regrets Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;.” You can try out the TV for 100 days, and if you don’t like it, Hisense will refund you after you send it back. Both Best Buy and Amazon are among the company’s approved retailers for the promotion. You just have to make sure to &lt;a href="https://hisense-promos.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;register your purchase with Hisense&lt;/a&gt; within 14 days of the purchase date, or else you won’t be able to get the refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MfzOAj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10739604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/io2DZsiz6qMn9IJhwuTkCy6C7AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311008/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_5.45.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dshGvK"&gt;Once a collector’s item due to their scarcity, this set of Joy-Con styled after &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; are both readily available &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;discounted at Walmart. Normally $80 for the two, they’re $10 off, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJoy-Con-L-R-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Skyward-Sword-HD-Edition%2F761765925&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $70 when you buy online through Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This set will work with the standard Switch, as well as the new Switch that has an OLED screen releasing later next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FvUemf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10784120"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Cnx5xa"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack doesn’t provide a lot of juice, but it sure is nice to use #shorts|103140" data-volume-uuid="06b797d44" data-volume-id="103140" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-579" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MfScOC"&gt;If you recently purchase an iPhone 13, or are more about the iPhone 12, you might want to check out AT&amp;amp;T’s deal on the MagSafe Battery Pack that can magnetically attach to either of these phones for a recharge. Normally $99, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeAppleMagsafeCharger093021/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/batteries/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it costs $84 now&lt;/a&gt;. We covered this deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/9/30/22701993/apple-magsafe-battery-pack-google-home-nest-hub-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, and admittedly I’m surprised that it hasn’t sold out, given it’s the first major price cut on this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8KGyr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As my colleague Dieter Bohn says in his review&lt;/a&gt;, this product is more about convenience than providing a massive amount of battery capacity. So, while it probably won’t totally refill your phone, it’s a solid investment for easy top-ups throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XGQoAv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaqaL96kykhKMgza4evkZ3D53Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890722/Stage_2__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W92znm"&gt;It’s our tenth birthday this year, and we’re hosting &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our very own party&lt;/a&gt; later this month in New York City. Good news: you’re invited! It’s a two-day party filled with special guests, live performances, food, drinks, and more. If you want to buy a ticket and join us, we’re going to share a special $50 discount code for &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; readers later today in our newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb9vf6"&gt;Of course, you’ll need to make sure you sign up for our &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter with the box below to see the discount. For those who are new to join us there, my colleagues and I aim to send out two newsletters a week, packed full of the best deals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OcWdWQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dZc1XR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We bought gadgets from Amazon’s banned brands and it was a piece of cake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAQ1wRHVsCK08BtFS2znoTVbRfQ=/0x126:3024x2142/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936294/verge_sean_hollister_20210930_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QjwQ5K"&gt;If you’re a reputable Chinese gadget manufacturer with millions of dollars at stake &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy"&gt;because Amazon banned your ass&lt;/a&gt; for inflating user reviews... do you roll over? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701144/amazon-chinese-companies-lawsuit-paid-reviews"&gt;File a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;? Or change a single letter in your name and try to sneak back onto Amazon anyhow? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k73nLj"&gt;It sure seems like Sunvalley, parent company of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"&gt;RavPower, Vava and TaoTronics brands&lt;/a&gt;, chose door number three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fndfdK"&gt;We recently spotted all three banned brands back on the Amazon storefront under the flimsiest of disguises: Vava had changed its name to “Vav,” TaoTronics became “Taotronic,” and RavPower was simply “Rav.” We took screenshots for posterity: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAgy9hRGjB9FnBxIjV5JifIzhaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892147/vav_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhB5uFz0G-2wP8p1wFCGGBgxCso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892148/taotronic_dear_dreams_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOCkqca4j8sSvp8LHOojHeIz1lc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892151/rav_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ouWZhn"&gt;They’re not the only ones, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"&gt;Banned brand Choetech&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even need to change a letter at first. It just hid in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8E2Ns9K5-jORzlaE2lUVCvTb9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892156/choetech_verge.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aoS1S7"&gt;Amazon didn’t catch any of these listings until we brought them to the company’s attention nearly two weeks ago, on September 17th. It was only yesterday that the company finished removing them — because yes, Amazon determined that these were indeed bad actors trying to dodge their bans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kMgFl"&gt;Here’s the company’s full statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="up8Hv9"&gt;We blocked these brands, their product detail pages, and the selling accounts used to perpetrate their policy violations. Unfortunately, these bad actors are motivated and use various tactics to evade detection in their attempts to harm honest customers, selling partners, and Amazon. We have a number of proactive controls in place that are preventing the vast majority of their attempts. If you discover a bad actor attempting to reenter our store that we have missed, we will investigate quickly and take the appropriate actions, including using this to continue to improve our proactive controls. Customers can contact Customer Service 24/7 via phone, email, and chat with any concern they have about a product or their shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4csBPW"&gt;Amazon doesn’t formally have a ban-dodging policy like some other platforms. No, the company &lt;a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G1801?language=en_US"&gt;doesn’t let you have more than one seller account&lt;/a&gt; — but that doesn’t necessarily apply here because Amazon wiped these brands’ previous accounts off the map. The new statement makes it pretty clear that the deterrent doesn’t end when a company’s first seller account is kicked off Amazon; they’re supposed to be gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOfx1Y"&gt;But if that’s the intent, Amazon needs to step up its game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHX4R4"&gt;Between the time we reported these items to Amazon and the time they removed them, we bought every single one of the items pictured above, had them shipped to us, and confirmed they were legit. While we were waiting for them to ship, we found &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; sellers carrying these banned products, ones we didn’t report to Amazon, which are still operational today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="at7ODe"&gt;Here, let me show you how easy it is to find a brand dodging its ban. Here’s another picture of that Choetech wireless charger:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fPfcMq5t69-MI_HBHlg5fR0DpSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892238/choetech_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVsh5D"&gt;Take a close look at the upper left. See how Amazon’s recommending I pick a very similar looking charger instead? &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charger-Certified-Charging-Compatible/dp/B098X8BVK3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Let’s click on it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JahSLCeQXG3HJLbDYwJ5QjVxWNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892240/choetech_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xezGSd"&gt;It’s similar because it’s the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; — it’s even sold by “Choe Technology.” Choe Tech. Choetech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc7vlN"&gt;Just to be absolutely sure, we bought that no-name charger from Amazon. Here it is, Choetech logo and all:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BleJxt2aa3kn8QndK5OT8ojWRjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892242/verge_sean_hollister_20210930_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zyKXdZ"&gt;In the upper-right corner of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; image, there’s a sticker that says “100% official product.” The back of the box has a QR code you can scan that takes you to &lt;a href="http://choetech.com/"&gt;choetech.com&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, there’s even a Choetech “Scratch and Check” label so you can be sure it’s authentic. I couldn’t stop smirking at just&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;how thoroughly official this product was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCX9qs"&gt;I should probably add that if you search Amazon for “Choetech,” the company’s products — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A31SFNOKIVH4CK&amp;amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER"&gt;12 of them and counting&lt;/a&gt; — are the first non-sponsored search results. I know Amazon’s employees can’t be everywhere whacking every mole, but if Amazon’s search engine knows exactly how to direct consumers to its banned brand, you’d think the company could direct its employees to them as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KehuVN"&gt;In case you’re wondering, no, none of these products came with a blatant “we’ll give you money for a review” insert card &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starfire2258/status/1407416198623494144"&gt;like the ones I’m soliciting&lt;/a&gt; for a future story. Three of them did come with a card suggesting I join their “VIP” program, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NiCsZ"&gt;P.S. Maybe Amazon should check out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=KALOXI&amp;amp;ref=bl_dp_s_web_0"&gt;Kaloxi&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like a dead ringer for TaoTronics. And to the Amazon rep who did snuff out &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1E2DACD8-335A-481E-B792-EB3F72170D40"&gt;iSmart&lt;/a&gt; before I could bring it to your attention: kudos!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYdckf"&gt;Sunvalley didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Our emails to Choetech bounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le13uV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cWTsN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Verge is happening October 22nd and 23rd, and you’re invited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlYPPOHcKDl29XQcexxX6AMidVA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69936061/Stage_2__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of The Verge’s 10-year party at Spring Studios in NYC. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Join us in New York City for live performances, amazing artists and creators, and much more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Kg9Dbv"&gt;Hello, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;friends! It’s almost been 10 years since we launched (can you believe it?), and to celebrate we’re throwing a big party. It’s happening on October 22nd and 23rd in New York City — and &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;we hope you’ll join us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVpRtM"&gt;We’re throwing this party at Spring Studios, which has a rich tradition of bringing creative people together to show off the future of tech, art, and culture. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;will completely transform the space for two days and fill it with special guests, live performances, interactive art and games, awesome food and drink, and an opening night party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s6d3e5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Join us at On The Verge!","description":"The Verge is turning 10, and you’re invited to help us celebrate in New York City on October 22nd and 23rd. (Hint: get $50 off the standard ticket prices with code &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;URGETOVERGE&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;.)","label":"Buy tickets","url":"https://voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/vergesecondary"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="naCd5g"&gt;Here’s some of what we’re excited about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mZNe56"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;exclusive premiere screening&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFPdR85yOiM_jt1LXuZmNesYYt0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892324/Springboard_Thumb.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1cOLZ"&gt;Everyone who attends On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will see the debut of our biggest documentary to date, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring split off from the mainstream tech world to try and invent the future before the present was ready for it. And though Handspring has been relegated to the margins of tech history, many of the predictions they chased in the late 90s would be correct. After the screening, we’ll hold a live Q&amp;amp;A with Dieter and Nilay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TZAiQs"&gt;Live performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="6JlhL4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbK_dQ5wXGk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4dwsn"&gt;Our opening night party will feature a live performance by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I73SGyUTsM"&gt;The Stickmen&lt;/a&gt;: an amazing DJ and drummer duo that will transform our expo space with light and sound. And we’ll have a great lineup of other talented DJs to bring the space to life throughout the entire event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8oDjmw"&gt;A one-of-a-kind indie arcade&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFrKpRby46MNr5VdJ339qsI949k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890465/ef97f32612f5c2179942fd123755ab13.WONDERVILLE.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95rs8S"&gt;We’ve assembled a wildly creative group of artists &amp;amp; creators to make On The Verge&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fun and interactive. That includes the folks from &lt;a href="https://www.wonderville.nyc/"&gt;Wonderville arcade in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, who will be putting together their unique lineup of games for guests to enjoy. (We’re particularly excited about The Giffinator, which will let you put yourself and your friends inside of a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;animated GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="k5WLcE"&gt;Experimental art&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fb72u9"&gt;We’re gathering creators working on the edge of the future, including the wildly talented &lt;a href="http://zach.li/"&gt;Zach Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;: an artist, researcher, and educator who creates performances and installations that take human gestures as input and amplify them in different ways. He’s bringing several works to On The Verge, including &lt;em&gt;Reflection Studies, &lt;/em&gt;which will transform one of the largest spaces at Spring Studios into an interactive art experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkKPLi"&gt;The Creators Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tcNId3"&gt;We’re turning the roof of Spring Studios into a space for interactive talks, demos, and performances — including science and tech demos, a creative illustration class, and a repair school hosted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22702324%2Fon-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our friends at iFixit&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to just hang out, you’ll be able to take in spectacular views of the city while enjoying some of the best food and drink it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dc3rTb"&gt;All-day programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2e8oqK"&gt;On top of all that, our main stage will be packed for both days of the event with live performances and talks with special guests. Head over to the event website &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;to learn more about who’s coming&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDTzIs"&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;first big event, and it won’t be our last. We hope you’ll join us as we kick off the next 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which will be bigger, brighter, and more exciting: just like the future we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj6nCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: COVID-19 is still a reality, and the health and safety of everyone at the event is our first priority. So everyone who joins us will be required to follow masking protocols and provide confidential proof of vaccination. Stay tuned: we’ll keep everyone updated on the latest health and safety requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble Bundle has raised $200 million for charity thanks to generous gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iayd-U955kGZSTgA4FnYdWaVxsU=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935830/humblebundle_200_million.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EP8ZUv"&gt;If you play video games on the PC then there’s a good chance at some point in your life you’ve purchased something from Humble Bundle: a digital storefront that regularly announces time-limited, pay-what-you-want game bundles, each of which sets aside a slice of the proceeds for charity. This week, the company announced that it’s now &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/09/30/200-million-raised-for-charity-thank-you-humble-community/"&gt;raised more than $200 million&lt;/a&gt; for good causes around the world — so: well done, gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2fz2D"&gt;The Humble Bundle concept first appeared in 2010, pioneered by indie game studio Wolfire Games, but was soon spun off into its own entity, with a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F1%2F22703917%2Fhumble-bundle-200-million-charity-milestone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated store&lt;/a&gt; and publishing subsidiary, Humble Games. Now the company offers bundles for books, comics, and software, as well as a monthly subscription service, Humble Choice. The firm recently raised more than $1.17 million for relief initiatives for COVID-19 through its Humble Heal bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lusbad"&gt;“Today, we’re excited to announce that since that very first bundle in 2010, tens of millions of you have now helped raise a total of $200 million through your Humble purchases, resulting in unparalleled support from the global gaming community for important social causes,” wrote the company in a &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/09/30/200-million-raised-for-charity-thank-you-humble-community/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neopets are being turned into NFTs because of course they are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FlSFEOzAUde6IbL7GKE0JLmye3Q=/1x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935788/neopets.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neopets was a hugely popular virtual pet adoption site launched in 1999. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sqw2oS"&gt;Virtual pet franchise Neopets is getting into NFTs — a seemingly inevitable move for a site with a long and varied history that has spawned a dizzying array of merchandise and offshoots, from magazines and cards to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18068518/neopets-legends-letters-new-mobile-game-puzzles-dragons"&gt;mobile games&lt;/a&gt; and a (promised) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21293330/neopets-animated-series-launch-fall-2021-merch-plush-mobile-site"&gt;animated series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxvtY9"&gt;You may not be familiar with Neopets, but it was a staple for many who grew up online in the early to mid-2000s. The basic concept is that users adopt virtual pets, and then spend hours farming games and events to attain items and customize their little darlings. It sounds simple, but the site was hugely popular in its day (thanks in no small part to a &lt;a href="https://www.themarysue.com/neopets-economy/"&gt;thriving and addictive&lt;/a&gt; internal economy), boasting more than 30 million active users around 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7JDANL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neopets had more than 30 million users in its heyday but has long been in decline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A4fBJ"&gt;Neopets has been in decline for a long time now, and it’s hard to get a handle on how many active users remain. The site itself is a wreck, due to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@nicolecarpenter/neopets-as-we-know-it-is-about-to-be-obliterated-78db2076412c"&gt;Adobe ending support for Flash&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to code much of Neopets’ original functionality. But there remains a core of dedicated Neopians — active enough that the brand’s current owners, JumpStart Games, evidently thought it worth trying to wring a little crypto out of fond memories for the site. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mKyBNjWXoxCfaz9eRGkWXgRnyio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22892991/Neopets_Neopets_Launches_its_First_NFT_Collection___The_Neopets.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CNW Group/Neopets&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Neopets NFTs are supposed to be launching some time this month. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ru3l0t"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/neopets-launches-its-first-nft-collection-the-neopets-metaverse-collection-823127718.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, JumpStart says it’s partnering with blockchain firm Raydium to produce 20,500 “equally unique, algorithmically generated lovable Neopets NFTs with variable backgrounds, assets, clothing, and personality — 7 varying trait categories.” Samples of the NFTs in question show a handful of neopets in custom outfits on gradient backgrounds. It seems from JumpStart’s announcement that the NFTs will just be... regular NFTs — aka pictures that you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;can’t actually do anything with&lt;/a&gt;, apart from acquire for bragging rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZonBIJ"&gt;The reaction from the Neopets community to the news has been overwhelmingly negative. Fansites like &lt;a href="http://JellyNeo.net"&gt;Jellyneo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://impress-2020.openneo.net/"&gt;Dress To Impress&lt;/a&gt; have strongly criticized the move, deriding it as a cynical cash grab, an environmentally destructive decision, and a launch that adds nothing to the core functionality of the site. “You can’t feed your NFT, read to it, battle with it, or customise it. It’s the #AntiNeopet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jellyneo/status/1442224869215662080"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; the official Jellyneo account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ExElDs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Neopets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Neopets&lt;/a&gt; community overwhelmingly rejects the new NFT cashgrab project. We’re hard pressed finding someone outside of the NFT community that wants this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/IkyQsdkLBv"&gt;https://t.co/IkyQsdkLBv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jellyneo.net (@jellyneo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jellyneo/status/1441799882600173573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="g8YYHm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dress to Impress's official position is that NFTs are bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They're an inherently zero-value product that commoditizes art in all the wrong ways,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and they further legitimize an environmentally destructive cryptocoin movement that is currently mostly a pump-and-dump scam.&lt;/p&gt;— Dress to Impress (@NeopetsDTI) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeopetsDTI/status/1441656600465264640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="55eHAP"&gt;The Neopets team has responded to some of this criticism, as per &lt;a href="https://www.jellyneo.net/?comments=13857"&gt;a Q&amp;amp;A shared on Jellyneo&lt;/a&gt;, but their answers are not particularly convincing. For example, on the charge that NFTs are harmful to the environment, the company says that its partners Raydium and Solana “[strive] to be a more environmentally friendly NFT solution than competitors” — a fairly meaningless statement. (Data on the environmental impact of NFTs is hazy at best, but, as with much crypto activity, we know that minting NFTs is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;an extremely energy intensive&lt;/a&gt; activity.) Similarly, in response to the question “Why make NFTs?” JumpStart says it’s “looking for new opportunities to drive our brands and product forward into the future.” It’s a depressingly honest answer, but not one that is likely to endear the project to Neopians who associate the franchise with beloved and nostalgic memories of their youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJMvdN"&gt;It’s worth noting also, that for a brand as long-lived as Neopets, this isn’t even their first time round the NFT blockchain. It previously launched a trading card game powered by NFTs called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neopetscrypto?lang=en"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neopets Cryptoquest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 which swiftly died out due to lack of interest. NFTs are, of course, a much bigger industry now than they were three years ago, but fans fear that whether or not this project lives has nothing to do with the long-term future of Neopets. As one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/pus6c1/tnt_isnt_going_to_fix_the_site_theyre_going_to/"&gt;representative post&lt;/a&gt; on the site’s subreddit notes: “TNT [The Neopets Team] isn’t going to fix the site. They’re going to milk it for what it has left and then close it for good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOpbF8"&gt;Perhaps this is simply the place of NFTs in a media landscape obsessed with the lingering value of “IP.” NFTs are a predator of last resort, sucking the remaining dregs of value from brands big and small in the name of financial efficiency. Will Neopets survive the embrace? The community’s certainly seen worse before, but the site is in decline in so many other ways (broken games and events; sporadic updates) that this might be the final straw. At any rate: this is a reminder to check on your neopets. They’re hungry and they miss you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Bing users search for Google more than anything else</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5z8x5CBaVjPKA_RFq44BAlTgck4=/0x0:1284x856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935667/Screen_Shot_2021_09_30_at_3.56.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DUkEcn"&gt;“Google” is the most searched term on Bing “by far,” according to a lawyer working for Google’s parent company, Alphabet. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-28/google-tells-judges-it-s-so-popular-it-s-bing-s-top-search-term?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google made the argument while trying to get its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/18/17580694/google-android-eu-fine-antitrust"&gt;$5 billion antitrust fine from the EU&lt;/a&gt; overturned, using the statistic as evidence that people use Google by choice, not force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7oJXT"&gt;The fine Google faces is from the European Commission, which says that Google has abused its position as the maker of Android. The regulator says that Google will have to stop forcing handset makers to pre-install Chrome and Google search if they want to have Android. Google’s argument? That most people would just use its search engine anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcX5eB"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/top-bing-searches/"&gt;statistics compiled by SEO company Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;, “google” is indeed the top searched term on Bing worldwide. It’s followed by “youtube,” “facebook,” “gmail,” and “amazon,” but it beats the runner-up by around 5 million searches. Looking at data for just the US, Facebook is number one, with Google being number three. At first glance, it does seem like people are using Microsoft’s search engine to get to Google’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RVLrGH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bing is the seventh most searched term on Bing in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SNFEwv"&gt;But hold on a minute. According to Ahrefs statistics, “bing homepage quiz” is Bing’s fifth most searched term in the US, and “bing” itself is number seven. The search engine’s own name is its tenth most-searched term globally. What’s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjFckH"&gt;Well, part of it may be because of defaults. For Microsoft Edge (and Internet Explorer before it), Bing is the default search engine — if you type something into that bar that isn’t a URL, it’s going to take you to the Bing results page. If you’ve ever watched someone who isn’t particularly good with computers try to visit a website, you may know where this is going. For many folks, typing in “Google” and clicking on the first link that comes up is how they get to Google, and it’s the same for Facebook, YouTube, and any other website they try to visit. Why bother adding a .com to the end when you can usually get to what you’re looking for with an extra click?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yfw5uo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Please do the four extra keystrokes to type .com&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DnUlYR"&gt;Of course, most techy people know why that’s not the best route — I’ve personally had to help relatives who’ve gotten viruses because somebody made a malicious ad that popped up as the first result on Google when searching for a popular website. But that’s how some people use the web. The numbers are also potentially bolstered by Bing’s integration with the Start Menu search bar. If you click on one of the web results, it’ll take you straight to Microsoft’s search engine (and people may search for “Google” there a lot, given &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_tables"&gt;Google Chrome’s popularity&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x78wS9"&gt;When contacted asking whether it could verify what Bing’s most searched term was, Microsoft said it didn’t have anything to share. Google also didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fic9IG"&gt;As for whether this helps or hurts Google’s argument, that’s really for the judge to decide. It’s just funny that, at least in part, Microsoft’s default search may have helped Google make its argument against the massive fine proposed for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; default search.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal agree to ‘short’ extension to avoid channels disappearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the NBC Sunday Night Football..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gQs2Mooy9zkEvi7IFzPtYRsZ0vQ=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69935171/1224647361.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5IhHkm"&gt;Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22695937/nbcuniversal-youtube-tv-carriage-dispute"&gt;public standoff&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have agreed to a “short” extension over the streaming service carrying several of the broadcaster’s channels. That means that at least for now, YouTube TV will continue to carry more than a dozen major NBCUniversal-owned channels, including NBC regional sports networks. But it also means YouTube TV’s monthly subscription cost won’t be getting $10 cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCSHvl"&gt;Had talks broken down, NBCUniversal programming would have been removed from YouTube TV at midnight ET. “NBCUniversal and YouTube TV have agreed to a short extension while parties continue talks,” an NBCUniversal spokesperson tells &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1443773993119469570"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/youtube-tv-nbcu-deal-explained.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “NBCUniversal will not go dark on YouTube TV at midnight eastern tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xOXNS"&gt;YouTube said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-nbc-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that should the companies fail to reach an agreement about carriage, it would slash its monthly subscription cost from $65 per month to $55 per month — undercutting comparatively priced live TV streaming services like Hulu with Live TV and FuboTV. But that would mean that YouTube TV users would lose a dozen-plus NBC channels, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9uT75t"&gt;NBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FXM4fG"&gt;Bravo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6kLUEx"&gt;CNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzHULB"&gt;E!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2YViN7"&gt;Golf Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uD9Jpf"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRIX6q"&gt;Oxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4akJE3"&gt;Syfy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Jx8NK"&gt;Telemundo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Tx1jfb"&gt;The Olympic Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nh0mtc"&gt;Universal Kids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F0LgTZ"&gt;Universo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7CLBb8"&gt;USA Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DoKsAs"&gt;As well as regional sports networks that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="G9EjTj"&gt;NBC Sports Bay Area&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="rYhCfK"&gt;SNY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qGTwmA"&gt;According to NBCUniversal, the standoff over carriage — which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623037/disney-hulu-netflix-warnermedia-att-friends-the-office-this-is-us-streaming"&gt;become&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445118/roku-nbc-tv-everywhere-channels-peacock-streaming-distribution-comcast"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;too&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156521/youtube-tv-fox-rsn-regional-sports-network-yes-sinclair"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; in the streaming wars, particularly when it comes to regional sports programming — involved a demand for what an NBCUniversal source close to the matter described as a fair rate relating to marketplace terms. A spokesperson for YouTube, meanwhile, said that the company was negotiating for terms that it sees as fair based on industry standards and the size of its service. The spokesperson also said that NBCUniversal asked YouTube TV to bundle Peacock, which the spokesperson claimed would result in users paying twice for the same content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0gxJz"&gt;YouTube preemptively said earlier this week that users looking for NBCUniversal-owned programming could head to NBCUniversal’s own flagship streaming service Peacock to access their NBC programming. Peacock’s Premium tier costs $5 per month, meaning that YouTube TV users would be saving a few bucks. But they would have to use two different apps to stream content that is accessible in a single, dedicated live TV service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA promotes Laura Miele to COO, making her one of the most powerful women in gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="awuqT7"&gt;Electronic Arts is promoting chief studios officer Laura Miele to chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/news/driving-transformation-for-players-and-growth-for-our-company"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The change is a big promotion for Miele, who already had significant leadership at the company overseeing 25 different studios. The new role will give Miele greater oversight over the company and arguably makes her the most powerful woman in gaming, an industry where there are few female executives, fewer in the C-suite, and where those C-suite execs are often in charge of HR or finance rather than the company’s products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kciWhb"&gt;Ubisoft did make Virginie Hass its chief studios operating officer last August, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;scandals over a toxic culture including sexual harassment and misconduct&lt;/a&gt; that went as high as the C-suite ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zfm5u"&gt;Miele joined EA in 1996 and has served as chief studios officer since April 2018. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Miele in July, where she discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587115/ea-pandemic-game-development-laura-miele-interview"&gt;how the pandemic changed development&lt;/a&gt; at EA. Miele will move into the role over the next few months, according to an &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/4bb534e7-2a16-45c6-8908-d94aba9bb285.pdf"&gt;SEC filing (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpHJ1w"&gt;EA also announced that chief financial officer Blake Jorgensen will be leaving the company. He’s expected to depart in 2022, and a search to replace him “will begin immediately.” Chris Bruzzo, who was previously the company’s executive vice president of marketing, commercial, and positive play, will become the company’s chief experience officer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn is buying Lordstown Motors’ Ohio EV factory for $230 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfWt7XNqGKBkt7qkW6nzTYD6sRk=/4x0:3996x2661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931850/1232963349.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="63Shtf"&gt;iPhone assembler Foxconn is buying an automotive factory from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors for around $230 million, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/30/2306712/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-and-Hon-Hai-Technology-Group-Announce-Agreement-in-Principle.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday. Foxconn says it has agreed to build Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck at the plant, which is where General Motors used to make the Chevrolet Cruze, and that the startup will remain a tenant there. Lordstown Motors will also “agree to provide Foxconn with certain rights with respect to future vehicle programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmMNZn"&gt;The deal gives the Taiwanese conglomerate its first automotive factory, and a significant new presence in the United States — one that the company will use as it tries to establish itself as a global electric vehicle automaker. Foxconn previously announced a massive LCD panel factory in Wisconsin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;but has failed to live up to the myriad promises&lt;/a&gt; it made to that state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTnp27"&gt;As part of the deal, Foxconn is also buying $50 million worth of Lordstown Motors shares. The startup has recently admitted it needs to raise money quickly in order to survive, despite going public last year. News of the factory sale was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/lordstown-nears-deal-to-sell-ohio-car-plant-to-taiwan-s-foxconn?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; early&lt;/a&gt; Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozNjEu"&gt;Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2-million-square-foot facility from General Motors in 2019 shortly after the Detroit automaker closed it down — a decision that drew the ire of then-president Trump. The startup previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; that it was planning to rent out space at the factory in an effort to make money amid a serious cash crunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M05uqb"&gt;Since buying it, Lordstown Motors has put about $240 million worth of work into getting the factory ready to build its electric pickup truck, the Endurance. A spokesperson for Lordstown Motors declined to comment. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tys6q"&gt;When GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, Trump praised the deal as “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” But the startup — which was founded by the former CEO of Workhorse, another struggling EV startup — has run into an incredible amount of trouble ever since, despite going public and raising hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020. Lordstown Motors’ CEO was forced out earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;after he was caught lying about the veracity of the preorders for its truck&lt;/a&gt;. The startup has lowered its initial production goals for that truck, too. Both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;launched probes into Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has said it only has enough money to survive through mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tSzMQv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"},{"title":"Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wBAayZ"&gt;Foxconn has spent much of the last year talking about expanding into electric vehicles as a way to diversify away from consumer electronics. It has struck deals with the likes of Geely, which is China’s largest private automaker, as well as Fisker Inc., a California EV startup that has yet to make an electric vehicle. Foxconn has also developed its own electric vehicle platform that it intends to sell to other automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU7S1x"&gt;In March, Foxconn said it would reveal the location where it would build EVs with Fisker Inc. by July, but that self-imposed deadline came and went. The company had considered using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;mostly empty complex it built in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; — another project that the Trump administration touted highly — but Fisker founder Henrik Fisker said he didn’t want to build his cars in a state that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/08/09/fisker-ev-plans-for-underused-foxconn-site-hit-snag-on-wisconsin-auto-sales-rules/?sh=2f5f19ea79de"&gt;wouldn’t allow him to sell directly to consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiNo7Q"&gt;Foxconn said Thursday that, as part of the deal, Fisker Inc. will be allowed to make vehicles with the Taiwanese conglomerate in the Ohio factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrBkVA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 8:32PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added new information from the press release about the deal between Foxconn and Lordstown Motors, and changed the headline to reflect that the deal has been officially announced. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom won’t buy Five9 after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eX8ITlt86e3STudJYXS6_SOInFs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69934738/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JxH8h"&gt;Five9 will remain independent — its deal to be acquired by Zoom is off. Though a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210930006016/en/"&gt;press release from Five9&lt;/a&gt; says it was “terminated by mutual agreement,” it’s also the case that Five9 shareholders rejected the $14.7 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzYv5n"&gt;Zoom originally announced the acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583371/zoom-buys-five9-14-7-billion-videoconferencing-lockdown"&gt;on July 18th&lt;/a&gt;. Five9 automates managing customer contacts for businesses, and the deal was supposed to bolster Zoom’s business offerings. Its major competitors are behemoths like Microsoft and Google, and the deal would have helped the smaller company expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBFwf8"&gt;This was supposed to be an &lt;a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-acquire-five9"&gt;all-stock transaction&lt;/a&gt;, but unfortunately for Zoom, its stock price has lost more than a quarter of its value since they announced the acquisition. Usually, when a company is bought, shareholders receive a premium over their stock price; because this was an all-stock deal, however, Zoom would be picking up Five9 &lt;em&gt;at a discount.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8unhg"&gt;Earlier this month, Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent proxy advisor, &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/technology/iss-tells-five9-investors-to-reject-zoom-s-14-7-billion-offer"&gt;recommended shareholders vote against the deal&lt;/a&gt;. The government also had a thing or two to say about possible &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zooms-nearly-15-billion-deal-for-five9-under-u-s-government-review-over-china-ties-11632247337"&gt;national security risks&lt;/a&gt;, which probably didn’t help matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn1LuN"&gt;In a blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-whats-next/"&gt;published Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan says the failed acquisition won’t significantly affect Zoom’s plans. Five9 “was in no way foundational to the success of our platform nor was it the only way for us to offer our customers a compelling contact center solution,” he said. Zoom plans to keep its “long-standing partnerships” with Five9 and other companies that offer similar services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIe20S"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
