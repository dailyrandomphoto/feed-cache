    <title>Epic’s store-crashing GTA V freebie brought more than 7 million new users to its online marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bGqjoBoa3WeSjqbRBM-lcxu0-z8=/57x0:3297x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749206/476_3840.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="focwv9"&gt;In May 2020, Epic Games offered &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; for free on the Epic Games Store, a deal that proved to be so popular it took down the store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;for more than eight hours&lt;/a&gt;. And thanks to documents discovered as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, we now have an idea of just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; popular the deal was: according to an internal Epic slide, it brought more than 7 million new users to Epic’s online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpW9z0"&gt;You can see the slide below, which also shows how many new users other freebies brought to the Epic Games Store. While other games like &lt;em&gt;Subnautica&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Civilization 6 &lt;/em&gt;drove a good number of signups (just under 1 million and 2.5 million, respectively), nothing comes close to the 7 million people who joined for &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://www.documentcloud.org/embed/enhance.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImLIbD"&gt;But even though &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; brought a tidal wave of new users, the Epic Games Store still has a long way to go to catch up with its primary competitor, Steam. Epic revealed &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-self-publishing-closed-beta-opens-today"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that the Epic Games Store has 58 million monthly active users, but that’s a little less than half of the more than 120 million monthly active players that Valve &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/2961646623386540826"&gt;last reported are on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvRL9V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, Epic reported 56 million monthly active users &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which means that the platform has only jumped 2 million users since then. That’s a slower rate of growth than the store has seen in the past — by comparison, monthly active users jumped from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million in December 2020, or an average of 2 million monthly active users more &lt;em&gt;per month&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u17YJa"&gt;Despite the slower growth, Epic still seems very committed to its platform. Alongside the news of the platform’s 58 million monthly active users, Epic announced a closed beta for self-publishing on the Epic Games Store. When self-publishing is available to all, it might open the floodgates for more developers to host their games on Epic’s store, which could bring in new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i83Y0f"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;other documents from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; describe an Epic initiative called “Project Moonshot” with a goal of getting the Epic Games Store to $1 billion in gross revenue by investing in “major launches, free games, and key sale(s).” It seems likely we’ll continue to see big pushes from Epic like the &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; freebie and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18293453/borderlands-3-release-date-trailer-xbox-ps4-pc-epic-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3’s&lt;/em&gt; initial Epic Games Store PC exclusivity at launch&lt;/a&gt; (which Epic paid $146 million to secure, the documents reveal) to attract gamers to its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans to prohibit sexually explicit content beginning in October </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dSzrxwGxj92iIHuL5aoi-hHdyE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749152/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E6qjUz"&gt;Video sharing site OnlyFans, best known for its creators’ adult videos and photos, will prohibit sexually explicit content starting October 1st. First &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it is making the changes because of pressure from its banking and payment provider partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcpuBo"&gt;“In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,” OnlyFans said in a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G7ho3"&gt;Creators on the platform will still be allowed to post nude images as long as they comply with the site’s &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/terms"&gt;acceptable use policy&lt;/a&gt;. More information will be available in the coming days, the company added: “OnlyFans remains committed to the highest levels of safety and content moderation of any social platform.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uXlUB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnlyFans pushes SFW app on iOS and Android as it tries to shake adult image","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BIZYVI"&gt;OnlyFans claims more than 2 million creators — who it says have earned more than $5 billion on its platform — and 130 million users. Last year, the site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628521/onlyfans-app-ios-android-oftv-no-nudity"&gt;generated $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in sales (of which OnlyFans receives a 20 percent cut). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FUT9G"&gt;The company is seeking investors at a valuation of more than $1 billion but has had difficulty attracting investors, &lt;a href="http://axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html"&gt;according to a report from&lt;em&gt; Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because of the proliferation of porn on the site (&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; notes the company didn’t mention pornography at all in its pitch deck to investors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7A5uq7"&gt;Despite its ability to draw eyeballs, and the safer environment it provides sex workers, online porn is a hard sell for investors. Recall that as Verizon prepared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20804894/tumblr-acquisition-matt-mullenweg-ceo-automattic-wordpress-verizon-changes-vergecast"&gt;sell Tumblr to Automattic&lt;/a&gt;, the blogging site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;permanently banned adult content&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, a highly controversial move at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBrU92"&gt;Along with the announcement about sexually explicit content, OnlyFans published its first &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/transparency/july2021"&gt;monthly transparency report for July&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, “as part of our commitment to safety and transparency.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjjJbX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 RT is reportedly on the way, but not for North America or Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iRhACtAz2Fq9RI5-MNtmbh7OlKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749115/ajohnson_210623_4644_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus N200, a sub-$300 phone, is the kind of budget device the company is offering in the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOzJfA"&gt;OnePlus may be getting ready to launch another variant of its 9-series phones, the 9 RT, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-rt-october-oxygenos-12"&gt;according to an &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; source&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the report, it looks to be a slightly upgraded version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348430/oneplus-9r-specs-price-availability"&gt;the OnePlus 9R&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched earlier this year with more modest specs than the flagship 9 and 9 Pro. That model never made it to North America, and it seems this will also be the case for the 9 RT. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;the Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577770/oneplus-base-9-pro-north-america-us-canada"&gt;the 9 Pro base model&lt;/a&gt;. But who’s keeping track?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqvGAG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, the OnePlus 9 RT will launch in October with a Snapdragon 870 processor, 120Hz OLED, a 4,500mAh battery, and OxygenOS 12 out of the box. For its main rear-facing camera, it will reportedly use the 50-megapixel sensor behind the same (very good) ultrawide as in the 9 and 9 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7dodMO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OgEhY8"&gt;The OnePlus 9 RT will debut in China and India, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;, and there are no plans to make it available in North American or European markets. That’s not too surprising, and it tracks with OnePlus’ recent strategy of limiting US releases to the high-end likes of the 9 and 9 Pro, along with the budget-oriented N200 and N10 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxyUYs"&gt;It’s possible that OnePlus sees an opportunity to gobble up some of the budget market share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;formerly occupied by LG&lt;/a&gt; and has focused its US strategy accordingly. In any case, it looks increasingly clear that bringing midrange devices like the Nord 2 and upper-midrangers like this rumored 9 RT to the US aren’t part of the company’s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prime Video releases new profile images for Amazon originals </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZPhLFQz6VUqh7xwt-qtKz30Nmo=/317x0:2218x1267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69749085/PrimeVideo_Profile_Images_Aug2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEp0Yf"&gt;Prime Video is giving users more options for personalizing their user profiles with the addition of characters from its original series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtGfc3"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315370/amazon-prime-video-user-profiles-kids-household-wallet-sharing"&gt;introduced user profiles&lt;/a&gt; to its Prime Video service last year, and it previously allowed supported personalized images for individual user accounts. Now, however, users can choose to make their account avatar a character from one of nearly two dozen Amazon original series, including &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bosch&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikQxTu"&gt;To change a user icon on Prime Video’s website, head to the Prime Video homepage and click “Manage Profiles” from the “Who’s Watching?” menu in the upper right corner. To change a user profile image on iOS, Android, and Fire devices, head to the “My Stuff” menu in the Prime Video app. Click on the profiles drop-down menu and then select “Edit.” From there, click on the user profile image to choose from one of Amazon’s new originals icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Lrj0r"&gt;The new additions mark the first time the service has introduced profile image options for popular characters from its originals. Amazon’s older icons will still be available on the service, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those can be found under the “Animals,” “Archetypes,” “Classic,” and “Moods” categories.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfhRi5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627527/call-of-duty-vanguard-teaser-warzone-event-activision"&gt;As expected&lt;/a&gt;, Sledgehammer Games officially announced the next &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; with the reveal of &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, which will be launching in November. The new shooter is set during World War II and will feature a “historically inspired” single-player campaign, along with a multiplayer mode and integration with &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Zombies&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78YPyZ"&gt;The announcement comes as Sledgehammer’s parent company Activision Blizzard, and in particular &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; developer Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;has come under fire for a culture of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;spurred by a lawsuit filed by the state of California&lt;/a&gt;. Since then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;employees have staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620800/activision-blizzard-departures-lawsuit-diablo-4-director"&gt;multiple high-profile developers at Blizzard have left the studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;including president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmUeAq"&gt;During a meeting with press last week, Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon opened with a statement regarding the situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wQX9qB"&gt;The stories and the pain that have been shared are simply devastating. We love making games, it’s what we do, it’s our life’s work, and we love it. But more importantly we’re humans, we’re here for each other, working side by side, and looking out for one another in good times and in bad. So on behalf of Sledgehammer Games, and all of the team supporting &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, harassment of any kind goes against everything we stand for as a studio. Everyone, regardless of their title, role, gender, orientation, or ethnicity deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQniD6"&gt;While we can’t comment on the lawsuit, what I can say is that as a team we are committed to making sure all team members feel safe, welcome, and respected. So please know that these thoughts and actions are at the top of our minds, and will be going forward. They speak to the core values of who we are and who we wish to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ij4YXW"&gt;As for the game itself, the core of &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; is its single-player campaign, which focuses on the origin of the special forces and will be told from multiple points of view; in addition to the Sledghammer narrative team, sci-fi writer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tochi_Onyebuchi"&gt;Tochi Onyebuchi&lt;/a&gt; is also working on the story. Sledgehammer says the narrative will cover “the untold stories of multinational heroes that formed Task Force One, changing the face of history and setting the stage for special forces as we know it.” It’ll feature a cast of characters inspired by real-world personalities, like Lt. Polina Petrova, based on Soviet sniper &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Pavlichenko"&gt;Lyudmila Pavlichenko&lt;/a&gt;, also known as “Lady Death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BuPuio"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10709077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5jzXmT"&gt;Outside of the campaign, there will be multiplayer with 20 maps at launch and game modes including “Champion Hill” where players duel solo or in squads of two or three. There will also be a &lt;em&gt;Zombies&lt;/em&gt; mode developed by &lt;em&gt;Black Ops&lt;/em&gt; studio Treyarch which will connect with the previous undead story from &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLpGUv"&gt;At the same time, Raven Software is leading development on a &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; map for the battle royale spinoff &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. When the new map launches later this year, it’ll be accompanied by a “new anti-cheat system,” according to Activision. The company describes the crossover as an “all-new metaverse connecting &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfU33H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt; is launching on November 5th and will be coming to the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty: Warzone and Destiny are making moves to fight cheaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6ksbHC3VCgO7C2Pn9CDlyZaNlk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748667/cod_warzone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXjsFZ"&gt;Alongside its reveal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22395356"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Activision Blizzard announced that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, its popular, free-to-play battle royale, will receive an update later this year that weaves a new “multi-faceted” anti-cheat system into the game. It will arrive alongside a brand-new map that’s currently in development by Raven Studios, though the system will work across all of &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZKg2Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;Cheating has been a huge problem for &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;since it launched in early 2020, as it is for almost every online competitive game, yet Activision Blizzard’s attempts to thwart cheaters — particularly in ranked matches — haven’t worked. The company hasn’t detailed exactly how its new system aims to succeed where it hasn’t before, as well as whether it’s being built internally or is licensed, but we’ll likely hear more as we get closer to the feature’s release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eNCqC"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is no longer operated by Activision Blizzard, Bungie announced today that it, too, will be incorporating an improved anti-cheat service into its game. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1428377075287662593"&gt;it will be “soft launching” a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.battleye.com/"&gt;BattlEye&lt;/a&gt; when the next season launches. Like &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; has been plagued by cheaters who ruin the experience for people who want to enjoy and progress through the game. Bungie will likely share more details during &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Direct/DestinyShowcase"&gt;its next &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;Showcase&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, August 24th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quake gets a visual overhaul on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch for its 25th birthday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6UbNqP0pjNTusG-obK1AvEIE9cw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748663/quake.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l9Fm5S"&gt;QuakeCon, the annual fan convention for the legendary first-person shooter, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201501/quakecon-quake-canceled-bethesda-id-software-25th-anniversary"&gt;canceled last year&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, but it’s back today with a nailgun-like bang. Machine Games and id Software have teamed up to create a visually enhanced version of the original &lt;em&gt;Quake &lt;/em&gt;game, after June 22nd marked the 25th anniversary of the game’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bfzgSY"&gt;It’s the classic &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt;, run-and-gun combat through medieval mazes with nailguns, grenade launchers, and shotguns, but it’s all in 4K with widescreen support, online multiplayer, and even new expansion packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWKzej"&gt;The original version of &lt;em&gt;Quake &lt;/em&gt;is now available on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, complete with up to 4K support, widescreen resolutions, enhanced models, dynamic lighting, anti-aliasing, depth of field, and lots more visual enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aj_M1oyZrgmgB4Mgjsc_cnkcrkQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792969/quakenew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake on an Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hg0pvC"&gt;Both the original &lt;em&gt;Quake &lt;/em&gt;expansion packs are also available, as well as two expansions developed by Machine Games. A four-player online mode for the campaign is available, or local split-screen co-op. There’s even eight-player multiplayer matches with crossplay support, or four-player split-screen local ones. &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; will also include support for fan-made mods and missions, including &lt;em&gt;Quake 64.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MN4oDt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake &lt;/em&gt;is available on PC, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2FQuake%2F9P1Z43KRNQD4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-CUSA24593_00-QKRMST0000000000/"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; for $9.99 (or free as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate), and on &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/quake-switch/"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOEDIcvZ4c1Rcd2lYsldpydQ6vo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792973/quakeswitch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake on Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cpwUaq"&gt;This is a pretty major overhaul of Quake, and it follows &lt;em&gt;Quake II&lt;/em&gt; being improved to run on modern PCs recently. &lt;em&gt;Quake II&lt;/em&gt; was modified to run with ray tracing in 2019, and Nvidia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18642279/quake-ii-rtx-demo-release-date-hands-on"&gt;released the project as &lt;em&gt;Quake II RTX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to demonstrate its RTX line of GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEfd9J"&gt;You can also still play the original 55MB &lt;em&gt;Quake &lt;/em&gt;on a Windows PC today, but the Steam version doesn’t include high resolution widescreen support and the controls are awkward by today’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noCOX6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake &lt;/em&gt;was first released 25 years ago as a successor to &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, and it quickly became one of the most popular competitive games in ‘90s. Bethesda and id celebrate Quake every year at QuakeCon, which spawned from a fan IRC server into a dedicated event with LAN tournaments and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department says facial recognition helped end an almost 15-year manhunt</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2S6LM03ccbuACk93pA_cblsKJCg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748588/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RC4sx6"&gt;A fugitive who &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/long-time-fugitive-self-proclaimed-offshore-gambling-operator-sentenced-48-months"&gt;Justice Department officials say&lt;/a&gt; had scammed more than 20 people out of hundreds of thousands of dollars was sentenced to four years in prison on Friday, after being on the run for almost 15 years. Austrian authorities were able to identify Randy Levine, 54, of Boca Raton, Florida, due to a facial recognition system according to the DOJ, after he tried to use an alias to open a bank account, leading to his arrest in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GofIN5"&gt;Levine fled the US in 2005, after authorities seized his passport as part of an investigation into an alleged scam he had been running, the DOJ said in a release. According to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/12311601/18/united-states-v-levine/"&gt;Levine’s plea agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which he signed in May, he would offer to set up gambling accounts for people if they sent him money. To help sell the idea that he really could help people make bets, Levine reportedly played a recording of casino sounds while he was on calls with victims (which he made using a Las Vegas phone number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2lTQH"&gt;Levine came under investigation by the FBI, but was able to get a replacement for the passport that law enforcement officials seized, by claiming the passport had simply been lost. He eventually ended up in Poland, where he was arrested in 2008. There was, however, a legal battle over whether he could be extradited to the US, which continued until late 2011. By the time Polish courts had decided that he could be extradited, Levine had already slipped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amLXSo"&gt;After another failed attempt to capture him in Guatemala, the FBI heard from Austrian authorities in May 2020, that a facial ID system had identified someone who looked like Levine, who was trying to open a bank account in the country using a Mexican passport, the DOJ said. Levine was then arrested in June, and extradited to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCMYfV"&gt;This isn’t the first time that we’ve seen high-tech systems help end the search for a fugitive — famously, data from a genealogy website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17288532/golden-state-killer-east-area-rapist-genealogy-websites-dna-genetic-investigation"&gt;helped authorities identify a serial killer&lt;/a&gt; who operated in the 1970s and 80s. Technologies like facial recognition and familial genetics remain controversial, though — for every story like Levine’s where they’re used as intended to crack difficult cases, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382398/robert-williams-detroit-police-department-aclu-lawsuit-facial-recognition-wrongful-arrest"&gt;false positives&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193471/aclu-eff-ftf-facial-recognition-legal-objection-filing-customs-airport-surveillance"&gt;concerns of governmental overreach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Atd799"&gt;Levine has also been charged by the US with &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/two-charged-with-duping-investors-out-of-5m-with-bogus-bitcoin-buying-brokerage"&gt;running a cryptocurrency scam&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/international-fugitive-and-disbarred-attorney-charged-over-5-million-cryptocurrency"&gt;criminal complaint filed against him and an alleged accomplice&lt;/a&gt; accuses him of stealing $5 million from two victims, after promising that he would give them Bitcoin in return. According to prosecutors, he never sent the promised Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a newsletter subscription button on profile pages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPgHpU0KwkE-AM0R3GmnK1hm8w4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748507/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YX1O1b"&gt;Twitter is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371221524189186?s=20"&gt;testing a feature&lt;/a&gt; that makes it even more enticing to use its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;recently acquired Revue newsletter platform&lt;/a&gt;: the ability to subscribe to a newsletter directly from a Twitter profile, without having to follow a link to a separate website. The feature &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/newsletter-subscribe"&gt;can be enabled by all Revue newsletter writers&lt;/a&gt;, but the button is initially only being shown to a test group of Twitter users on Android and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0lE99"&gt;The subscribe button has to be turned on in Revue’s settings before it can show up on Twitter. Visually, the new button and newsletter card appear underneath your Twitter bio almost like a pinned tweet, populated with the title of your Revue newsletter, a photo, a short description, and the actual subscribe button. Tapping the button pulls up a dialog box reminding you what you’re getting in to (this person you follow on Twitter will now have your email) and lets you read a sample issue of the newsletter and then subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xc6Ti7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s here  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we’re starting to test a feature that allows people to subscribe to your Revue newsletter directly from your Twitter profile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's available to all Revue creators immediately. To start though, your newsletters will show only for a test group on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YDa1aOGeLM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YDa1aOGeLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Revue (@revue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371221524189186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DuVGPX"&gt;It’s a super simple feature, but possibly a very meaningful one for someone considering starting a newsletter — or transitioning to Twitter’s platform. While writing a newsletter can theoretically be successfully done by anyone, financially successful newsletters are often written by people with an established writing career, an established following, or both. Twitter’s now made it dramatically easier to convert a following into subscribers with a few taps. That’s a lot less clunky than having a Substack link in your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qhK0p"&gt;Easy newsletter subscriptions are just the latest offering in Twitter’s rapidly expanding suite of features, several of which are also hosted on the profile page. The company began experimenting with collecting direct payments with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;a Tip Jar feature in May&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also enabled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597576/twitter-shopping-module-pilot-gamestop-arden-cove-brands"&gt;a shopping “carousel”  for select brands&lt;/a&gt; that lets you buy products without leaving Twitter. The profile page is a space often used by creators to link to competing newsletter and subscription products, but if Twitter gets its way, you might never leave its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V2mO7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Hammerhead True Wireless (2021) review: ANC with a colorful light show</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Razer did the Razer thing and put RGB lighting on its latest earbuds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KlnqWU"&gt;Razer is suddenly becoming a seasoned earbuds brand: the new $130 Hammerhead earbuds are the company’s third pair of true wireless buds. They follow the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937068/razer-truly-wireless-headphones-hammerhead-bluetooth-5-earbuds-android-gaming-mode-price"&gt;original Hammerheads released in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22272549/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-pro-review-specs-price"&gt;I reviewed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The latest set is more “Pro” than not in both looks and features: they offer active noise cancellation, a low-latency gaming mode, and have switched to a in-ear design with silicone tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEX0we"&gt;But these days (and at this price), those features are no longer enough to stand out from a hugely crowded field. So Razer decided to add something to its new earbuds that’s impossible to miss: RGB lighting. Just like many of the company’s laptops and gaming accessories, the 2021 Hammerhead True Wireless include Razer’s full Chroma RGB system, which lets you pick from 16.8 million colors and a variety of flashy effects that shine through the snake logo on each earbud. It makes for what Razer calls “the ultimate wireless earbud flex.” But it’s a flex that only other people will see: it’s not like you’ll ever notice the RGB glow when you’re wearing the earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8Bcs5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10709325"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0h52yq"&gt;By default when first paired with your phone, the Hammerhead True Wireless buds use a “spectrum” effect that smoothly transitions through a variety of colors. If you want to switch up the lighting, you’ll need to install the Razer Chroma RGB app for Android and iOS — separate from the Razer Audio app that’s used for EQ adjustments and customizing the touch controls. Two apps for a single pair of earbuds? Really? Surely Razer could just replicate the RGB functionality in the main audio app to reduce clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pNE3D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio meter:&lt;/strong&gt; the RGB lighting reacts to the music being played. You can choose to have this effect work with a single color — where it honestly just looks like the light is on the fritz — or rapidly cycle through an endless array of different hues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdgXwx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing:&lt;/strong&gt; a slow pulsating effect where the RGB lighting repeatedly brightens and dims. In this mode, you can set two different colors to switch between with each “breath” or have the earbuds pick a different color every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnICIv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spectrum:&lt;/strong&gt; the earbuds smoothly switch between a wide range of different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bup63"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static:&lt;/strong&gt; the RGB lighting will stay on whichever color you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bhRxOasBQhockYmATGcrc2rJdzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792489/DSCF4670_Edited_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds now slot into the case vertically, whereas the original Hammerheads laid flat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpsYT"&gt;Out of the box, the lighting is set to 50 percent brightness, which is enough to draw attention — especially if you’re wearing them at night. And let me tell you, those lights will prove very useful should you drop an earbud onto the floor since they’re so easy to spot. Razer says the RGB lighting is optimized for a minimal impact on battery life, but it still takes a toll. With both ANC and the lighting turned off, the Hammerhead True Wireless can hit 6.5 hours of listening time. Using the RGB feature cuts off an entire hour, and the estimate drops to 5.5 hours. Add ANC to the equation and you’re left with only four hours of continuous playback. (With RGB off and ANC enabled, they’ll last up to 4.5 hours.) Those numbers lined up with my experience, and I imagine most people will keep the lights on unless they’re on a long flight or other scenarios where battery life is a priority. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENoC8RiQow2mxzzdicNVIT-rilo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792450/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_2.52.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RGB lighting does have a detrimental impact on battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KMYXPo"&gt;The Razer Audio app includes equalizer controls: you can pick from presets like “enhanced bass” or “vocal,” but it also gives you full control over the EQ range if you want to adjust every slider to your liking. The app is where you can remap the touch controls, which by default are fairly standard: tap once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, three times to go back, or press and hold to toggle ANC. But Razer gets a little over-ambitious beyond that. I’m all for customizable controls, but “double tap and hold” is where you start to lose me. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwh6BfjsUYUNLq7gCVcsor2MX9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792576/app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer audio app includes EQ customization and control remapping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vb1j4W"&gt;Whether it’s user error or imprecise touch sensors, it’s too easy to mess up that gesture and skip to the next song when you didn’t mean to. The earbuds went into pairing mode once or twice when I didn’t get it just right. And by default, that’s how you control volume — something you’ll want to do often! Frustratingly, you can’t assign volume to the simpler hold gesture (or any of the others). There were also times when the touch controls stopped responding until I cased the earbuds and pulled them out again, so Razer has more work to do with firmware updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/554f_oPpcafDrLOsEC5xWpYqKmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792467/DSCF4641_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depending which RGB mode you choose, the earbuds might be different colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wMKeq8"&gt;Design-wise, the Hammerhead True Wireless are very similar to the company’s pricier Pro model. They’ve got the same overall long-stemmed shape, and their cases are practically identical. (Neither set supports wireless charging.) But there are subtle differences when you look closer: the Pros are more matte, while the lower-cost earbuds are all glossy. Razer includes a deluge of tips with the Pros (including Comply foam tips), but you only get the typical S / M / L trio of silicone options with these. And there’s also a large mic inlet on the Hammerhead Pros for their hybrid ANC, whereas the regular model uses a smaller mic that’s better concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="e4DHYB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10709377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUVrSq"&gt;Like the Pros, the second-gen Hammerhead True Wireless had a solid fit in my ears and felt both lightweight and comfortable. The large tips made for a nice seal and good noise isolation, which helped boost the noise cancellation and made it feel more effective than it otherwise would. Like a lot of earbuds in this price range, Razer will cut out some of the hums and rumbles of everyday life, but they can’t knock out as much of the surrounding world as premium options like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the AirPods Pro. But these earbuds will cancel enough noise to keep you focused on your &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; session at the coffee shop without constant distractions. They’re also rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, making them a feasible option for runs and other workouts. If you’re on an evening jog, having lights in your ears could be yet another visibility measure to help keep you safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Mbuxj5OdJvZId3pvKYdYSwxyzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792478/DSCF4633_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RGB lighting is quite noticeable even at 50 percent brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EXDe4"&gt;Gaming mode on the Hammerheads cuts audio latency down to 60ms, which is enough to avoid any sync issues that could quickly pull you out of the action. But when it’s enabled, you’ll need to stay closer to your device than normal for optimal performance; Razer recommends keeping within two feet. The buds have Bluetooth 5.2 and didn’t exhibit any problematic cutouts or other bugs in my time testing them so far. And despite lacking the “THX certification” that the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros have, their sound quality is quite pleasing for the price. They aren’t as detailed or full-bodied as earbuds in the $200-300 tier, and the recent $150 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; outperform them with more dynamic sound. But Razer gave the 10mm drivers a nice, even-handed tuning that spans genres well — and those comprehensive EQ controls always help if you want to tinker. They’re neither brilliant nor bad and are right in that place where $130 earbuds so often land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Am4LTj"&gt;The Razer Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds aren’t going to be a fit for everyone’s taste: I’m perfectly happy with low-key earbuds that don’t emit a light show whenever I’m wearing them. But by adding RGB lights to its latest earbuds, Razer is doing the obvious Razer thing, and it’s a unique trick that might appeal to some of the company’s diehard fans. I’d sooner recommend something like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; to people looking for an everyday, under-$150 pair of wireless earbuds. But those won’t get people looking at you quite the same way that these do.&lt;/p&gt;
