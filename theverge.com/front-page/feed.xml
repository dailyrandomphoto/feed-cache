    <title>A multiplayer Pac-Man game is coming to Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0FZMgFBV4RdGbYBWzdYpbhl0nU=/0x0:1974x1316/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235758/MazeCreator1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KvSna3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; is a new multiplayer-focused spin on the classic arcade game that you’ll be able to play right on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3TAyw"&gt;The main draw of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; is the ability to play co-op Pac-Man with up to three other people. Players work together to try to survive the pesky ghosts, but they’ll also be competing for the highest score. You can make rooms to play with your friends, and Facebook Gaming streamers can invite viewers to join their game with Facebook’s Play with Streamer feature. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMjOIJQqfTuMQrpV_ANDiTWaeIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061915/PlayWithStreamer2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You can join a &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;em&gt; game right from a livestream.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="63XkZy"&gt;You won’t just be working through the familiar &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; maze, though. Players will be able to make their own levels, which could lead to some &lt;em&gt;Mario Maker&lt;/em&gt;-style delights or deviousness once people get their hands on the level creator tools. (If you want to play the entire classic version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man, &lt;/em&gt;that’s an option, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utBOPL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; also features the first of what Facebook is calling Facebook Interactives with its “Watch” mode, which is launching in beta. In Watch mode, 2D mazes are converted to an isometric 3D view, and viewers can power up Pac-Man or the ghosts. User-created maps can appear in Watch mode, too, meaning players might be able to create some interesting tests for the AI-driven characters. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TS3JJ2uuas8SADKFtjV2qKmQL5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061922/Watch1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;em&gt;’s Watch mode.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ITqcqk"&gt;If you’re interested in trying &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt;, it’ll be available for free beginning Monday on desktop and the mobile versions of the Facebook app. It will be exclusive to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbN4Ii"&gt;The game — which was developed by &lt;a href="https://www.genvidtech.com/"&gt;Genvid&lt;/a&gt;, a company that specializes in interactive livestreamed experiences — could be a signal of how Meta wants to expand Facebook’s gaming offerings to let streamers play games directly with their audiences. Facebook already offers Twitch-like livestreaming as well as games you can play right inside the app (and some that even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21528438/facebook-cloud-gaming-beta-android-web-jason-rubin-interview"&gt;stream from the cloud&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;twist on a familiar formula seems like it could be a smart first step into interactive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aYhUOE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Pac-Man Community’ has shades of ‘Pac-Man Live Studio’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhe11V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; seems similar to &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;, a multiplayer &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; game with a level editor designed to be played on Amazon-owned Twitch that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440891/amazon-games-pac-man-live-studio-twitch-bandai-namco"&gt;still hasn’t been released&lt;/a&gt; despite being announced in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;May 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Bandai Namco assures &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they’re different games, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPksgE"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt; is a brand new Facebook instant game from Bandai Namco Entertainment and Genvid that will be available in December,” a Bandai Namco spokesperson said in a statement. “We don’t have any specific news to share about &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; today, but we will communicate updates and more &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; news in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vns36n"&gt;The future of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t seem bright. Its official Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/"&gt;no longer exists&lt;/a&gt;, a previously functioning URL about the game on &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;Amazon Games’ website shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, and a previously functioning URL on Bandai Namco’s website &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;now redirects&lt;/a&gt; to a directory of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; games. But if &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio &lt;/em&gt;never sees the light of day, at least there’s &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Community&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can attend the Game Awards red carpet in the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDLm3FvBwzOFoORiU5o7OouCanM=/92x0:1057x643/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235767/axialtlt_core_16d_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jdgUDL"&gt;The Game Awards is the latest institution to try its hand at virtual worlds. The awards show, which takes place on December 9th, will be available to watch through the usual platforms like YouTube and Twitch. But viewers can also check it out via what’s described as a “metaverse experience” built with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21158189/core-free-game-creation-tool-pc-youtube-twitch"&gt;the creation tool Core&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGjvva"&gt;Players will not only be able to watch the event within the Core experience, but also do things like attend a virtual version of the red carpet, along with “several unique interactive experiences that are only available during the broadcast.” There will also be an afterparty with a currently unnamed DJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLs1ef"&gt;The move is just part of a growing trend of virtual worlds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;all banded together under the metaverse label&lt;/a&gt;, being used by everyone from Facebook to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. In the case of the Game Awards, the expansion makes a lot of sense, given that the show is already broadcast on a huge range of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICvyY4"&gt;The Game Awards kicks off at 9PM ET on December 9th, and the show has historically been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166109/the-game-awards-2020-announcements-trailers-fortnite-smash-bros-among-us-mass-effect"&gt;a place full of game reveals and big trailers&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month host Geoff Keighley confirmed that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;given the ongoing revelations of abuse at Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817651/activision-blizzard-the-game-awards-harassment"&gt;the publisher would not be involved with the show outside of its nominations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel’s lock screen Snapchat shortcut is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mA9FXslofqpqtWjA9DSdVjP8ZDY=/0x0:2512x1675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235787/image3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel’s new Quick Tap to Snap feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zo2E1H"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap, a Google Pixel feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that lets you open Snapchat directly from your lock screen by tapping twice on the rear of the phone, is arriving as part of the Pixel’s latest feature drop. The functionality will be available on the Pixel 4A 5G and newer devices, and Google says there’s also a new Pixel-exclusive Snapchat filter called “Pixel Face” on the way this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQ88uj"&gt;The Quick Tap to Snap feature is one of a handful of updates coming as part of the Google Pixel’s feature drop this month. Other features include new ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on the Pixel 6 Pro, a new “conversation mode” accessibility feature in the Sound Amplifier app, and the expansion of car crash detection and automatic transcriptions to more countries and languages, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3die9m"&gt;We’ve known since its launch that the Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;includes an ultra-wideband chip&lt;/a&gt;, but until now it’s not been used for much. However, with this latest update, Google says the 6 Pro’s UWB chip will be used to improve its Nearby Share feature when sending files to other ultra-wideband devices, including compatible Samsung phones. UWB chips found in Samsung and Apple’s recent phones have used the technology to accurately pinpoint their respective &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373410/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-plus-uwb-ar-bluetooth-price-release-date"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;trackers&lt;/a&gt;, but similar functionality has yet to make an appearance on Google’s latest phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WygfKEcLEX0kpULp-3i8m-OyUCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067299/ezgif.com_gif_maker__6_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound Amplifier feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jKgDGX"&gt;Google is characterizing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708608/google-sound-amplifier-accessibilities-android-6-marshmallow-support-expansion-how-to"&gt;Sound Amplifier’s&lt;/a&gt; “conversation mode” as an “early-stage accessibility feature.” It’s designed to tune out distracting background noise when you’re trying to listen to someone, with an interface that’s as simple as pointing your phone at the person to whom you want to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djVGbF"&gt;A couple of previously launched features are also expanding. The Pixel’s Recorder app, which allows you to automatically transcribe speech, now supports more languages like Japanese, French, and German on the Pixel 3 and up. These languages were previously exclusive to Pixel 6 devices, according to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9516618?hl=en"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;. Car crash detection, which originally launched with the Pixel 4 in 2019, is also expanding to more countries. It’s coming to Taiwan, Italy, and France, after having previously been available in Spain, Ireland, Japan, the UK, Australia, Singapore, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxGiwg"&gt;There are a couple of customization tweaks coming to select Pixel devices and accessories. If you’re using a Pixel phone with the A-series Pixel Buds you now get more control over bass response, and the Pixel 3 and newer can now customize how long you need to hold the power button before the Google Assistant activates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQvRe9"&gt;Google says these features are rolling out “in the next few weeks.” The exact availability of features varies by Pixel model. They join a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811617/google-android-auto-widgets-assistant-family-bell-updates-december-2021"&gt;collection of new features&lt;/a&gt; that were announced for the Android platform more generally last week, which included the ability to unlock select 2020–2022 BMW cars in certain countries by tapping Pixel 6 phones on the door handle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV adds more than 300 free channels to its live tab with Pluto TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B7AKCntewHTHlekPEASKUM18xMw=/74x0:865x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235770/image002__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WIyeVJ"&gt;Google TV is adding yet another cord-cutting option to its live TV tab. With the addition of Pluto TV, Google TV users now have even more live TV channels to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6frkJ"&gt;Beginning today, Google TV will now support Pluto TV within the live TV tab, meaning users can easily access more than 300 free channels from the platform’s primary live TV hub. Pluto TV is the fourth streaming service to grab a spot on Google TV’s tab. Previously, Google TV supported YouTube TV, Philo, and Sling — all of which require paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uTdrA"&gt;Technically Google TV already offers plenty of free live TV services through its apps, but baking an ad-supported service directly into the live tab is a much easier way to find live and linear coverage. Plus, rival streamer Roku already supports free live TV through its Roku Channel experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Z0rZn"&gt;In addition to adding Pluto TV to its live tab, new Google TV users can also &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/peacock-promo-terms/"&gt;claim six months&lt;/a&gt; of Peacock Premium for free (after which time, it’ll cost $5 a month). Peacock Premium gives users access to originals, live sports, on-demand movies, and series, as well as WWE programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFDfUT"&gt;Google said in a blog post that the new Pluto TV integration will be supported on all Google TV devices within the coming weeks, with more free streaming options on the way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC investigating Trump SPAC deal to take his social media platform public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Departs The White House En Route To Army v Navy Football Game" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N4QzJIZtRD3W3BLVUOqE5sVaHbQ=/0x0:4158x2772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235740/1230086816.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The SEC is investigating a SPAC deal involving former President Trump’s nascent social media company. | Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DsbNj7"&gt;Two US regulatory agencies are investigating the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that plans to take former President Trump’s nascent social media company public. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348598/d242442d425.htm"&gt;Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that it has received inquiries for information from the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcPUHq"&gt;The SEC is interested in documents related to communications between the SPAC and Trump’s social media venture, including “documents relating to meetings of DWAC’s Board of Directors, policies and procedures relating to trading, the identification of banking, telephone, and email addresses, the identities of certain investors, and certain documents and communications between DWAC” and the Trump Media and Technology Group, (TMTG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xmqEm"&gt;FINRA, meanwhile, is seeking details about a review of trading that happened prior to the October 20th announcement that &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2660/rl104194.pdf"&gt;DWAC was merging with TMTG.&lt;/a&gt; According to DWAC’s Monday regulatory filing, the inquiries occurred in late October and early November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAIQAv"&gt;If either agency finds evidence of improper financial dealings in the SPAC’s inception, it could derail the project, leaving the fate of Trump’s media company in jeopardy. And SPAC shareholders can withdraw their investment at any time before going public. While 2020 was a big year for SPAC deals, in recent months, investors’ excitement about the deals has cooled. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported last week that since July, the average SPAC deal has lost more than half its money before the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k88V83"&gt;If approved, the SPAC deal would give Trump’s company nearly $300 million to get Truth Social, which is essentially a Twitter clone, up and running. It would also bring the company public, with a listing on the Nasdaq exchange. &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2660/rl104343.pdf"&gt;TMTG said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that it had agreements with a “diverse group of institutional investors” — whom it did not identify — to raise about $1 billion as part of a concurrent private funding round. According to the release, DWAC projects Truth Social to reach 40 million subscribers and 81 million total users by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f7SMMi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fNPLJh"&gt;DWAC said it was cooperating with the information requests and noted in its SEC filing that “the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.” It made a similar note about FINRA’s request that its inquiry “should not be construed as an indication that FINRA has determined that any violations of Nasdaq rules or federal securities laws have occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tCqB8"&gt;Trump first registered TMTG in February and, in its initial investor presentation, said it planned to build a “media powerhouse ... to fight back against the ‘Big Tech’ companies of Silicon Valley who have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.” The former president was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;barred from Twitter, Facebook, and other social platforms&lt;/a&gt; in January after his supporters carried out an insurrection on the US Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CcvpB"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-urges-sec-to-investigate-potential-violations-of-securities-laws-during-spac-merger-with-trump-company"&gt;November letter to SEC chair Gary Gensler&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) asked the SEC to investigate the Trump SPAC deal, saying that DWAC and TMTG had “brazenly flouted” securities rules. Warren cited an October 29th &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/business/trump-spac-digital-world.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that reported that DWAC head Patrick Orlando had been in discussions for a deal with Trump since at least March. Warren pointed out that SPACs “are required to disclose any direct or indirect conversations with potential target companies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP45dX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is now available at Best Buy (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PEdX6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 6th, 1:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of PlayStation 5 consoles for now. This one came up very suddenly, and sold out just as quickly. We are continuing to monitor further console restocks from Best Buy and other retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNr7QK"&gt;If you still haven’t been able to land one of Sony’s next-gen consoles, Best Buy is giving you another shot. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9qIWV8zie" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$500 PlayStation 5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt; is available right now, though, we’ve seen no indication the retailer will restock the PS5 Digital Edition, the $400 configuration of the console that lacks an optical drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUL1fG"&gt;Unlike some of Best Buy’s console restocks, this one is available to the general public online and not just for its TotalTech subscribers, despite an “exclusive access event” flag. Still, we recommend heading to the link of your choice as quickly as possible to hop in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SacwVZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="mhH6xx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rlMz0K"&gt;A few must-haves for PS5 owners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mSaDm8"&gt;If you are lucky enough to land a PS5, there are a few additional accessories and titles we recommend picking up alongside the console, some of which are currently on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AcAFUa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Neo still knows kung fu in the latest trailer for The Matrix Resurrections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mepn6Qepa1U2A_2fDT49unFNzu8=/471x0:1950x986/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235628/Screen_Shot_2021_12_06_at_12.22.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9HFIMZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNpvWBuTfrc"&gt;The latest trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is here, and it’s more mysterious than ever, hinting at a repeating loop of ideas, scenes, and moments from the original trilogy of films. But one thing is made clear, amidst all the confusion: Neo (Keanu Reeves) definitely still knows kung fu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPCgGQ"&gt;The new trailer’s action bounces between the digital world of the Matrix and the post-apocalyptic world outside of it, intermixed with clips from the first three &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;movies. And while it’s not very clear what’s actually going on, it seems that a main focus of the film will be Neo working to reunite with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) — something that will presumably be difficult, given that both characters appeared to die at the end of 2003’s &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Revolutions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="227nNb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like déjà vu all over again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrvbMo"&gt;That said, the movie’s marketing has definitely been building heavily on the idea of a repeating cycle: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812697/new-matrix-resurrections-trailer-warner-bros-keanu-reeves"&gt;an earlier trailer from last week&lt;/a&gt; (titled “Déjà Vu”) also heavily emphasized the echoes between the prior films and &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; while similarly emphasizing that “this isn’t the story we think it is.” And with &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s world literally built on the idea that reality can be created and manipulated, it’s entirely possible that director Lana Wachowski intends to uproot the audience’s expectations again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPq12q"&gt;Fortunately, there won’t be too long to wait to figure out just what on earth is going on in the upcoming sequel: &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; debuts on HBO Max and in theaters in just a few weeks on December 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is down to $100 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z9eZCOFbtVB7q5QMXCDPVzr-Rj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235583/dbohn_201109_4283_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo can charge a Qi-equipped iPhone alongside an Apple Watch.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Kfo3E"&gt;Another week, another round of deals worthy of your consideration to save your hard-earned money. Last week, we saw Apple’s MagSafe Battery pack fall to a new all-time low, and now its premium dual-wireless charger is following suit, with more deals in tow if you read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKVuVq"&gt;While the iPhone’s MagSafe charging ecosystem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;remains a bit of a mess&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been with us long enough to see sizable discounts hitting its upper crust of accessories. The MagSafe Duo charger may not be everyone’s favorite — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we flagged some quibbles we had with its design and asking price — but it remains one of the fastest ways to wirelessly charge an iPhone and Apple Watch from a single source. It also folds up for easy travel and storage. At a new low price of $100 ($29 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nEXnt5Mz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, it’s definitely worth considering. Just be sure to budget for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C power adapter&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t already have one, as the MagSafe Duo does not include it and you’ll need at least a 20W model to fast-charge your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RVSQM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oRocMb"&gt;On the topic of tech we can appreciate a little more once the price drops, the Fitbit Charge 5 is still $50 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nl8R6oaf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BXQ4HMB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The Charge 5 is the latest model of Fitbit’s popular line of fitness trackers, however, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Jay Peters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;felt that the wearable’s reliance on a touchscreen really hampered the experience&lt;/a&gt;. The shortcomings of the Charge 5 are easier to overlook now that it costs 28 percent less, especially since it packs a bright, color screen and stress management features. The $130 price point matches the Charge 5 price we saw on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so you are getting the best price around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JwJ89n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fitbit is rolling out an ECG app to the Charge 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22765408/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-electrocardiogram-app-daily-readiness-score"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RwOBpw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905023"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DyUvyC"&gt;Shifting over to a different kind of wearable, one that’s also helpful for your fitness routine, the Bose Sport Open earbuds are $30 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VRLZGMF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nDQEkc7Z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. These are some unique earbuds from Bose, offering an open design that helps keep you aware of what’s around you. Our own Dieter Bohn tested these Bose, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alongside several other open-design listening options&lt;/a&gt;, and found them to have very good sound quality, though they may not be ideal if you wear eyeglasses while you run or bike, as the earbuds’ hook may get in the way. Still, for just $169, you can have great sound while maintaining a high level of situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wv7h2D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLjDFE"&gt;If you’re in the market for a future-proof tablet, the current discount on the 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor and 512GB of storage offers a lot of headroom for an excellent value. This configuration of iPad Pro can be had from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0931YYPNN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $979&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $120. The M1 chip ensures that this iPad Pro will stay quick and snappy years into the future, and with four times the amount of storage as the base model, you can be a little less reliant on iCloud and other cloud-based storage solutions. The iPad Pro also sports Apple’s new Center Stage feature, which allows the front-facing camera to automatically track you during video calls. Just add a keyboard and you have yourself a serviceable laptop alternative. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nlRX0x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Brydge’s 11-inch Max Plus iPad keyboard is now available","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759698/brydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="SXHsJw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905041"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ndq1JX"&gt;Some more deals on tech, accessories, and gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0vVmvx"&gt;Twelve months of Xbox Live Gold is just &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal120621&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-12-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832011522" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 at Newegg&lt;/a&gt; with promo code &lt;strong&gt;SSAZZ624&lt;/strong&gt;. This can be a cost-effective way to get into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, if you’re not already subscribed. Add it to your account, buy one month of Game Pass, and the 12 months of Xbox Live will be converted. If you already have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, this can extend your membership by an additional four months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nD8nEH"&gt;Apple’s official Leather Case with MagSafe for the iPhone 12 Mini is just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5PWGZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$24 in black at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, instead of the usual $59. That is a great value if you have the diminutive-sized iPhone from last year and want some premium leather without the premium cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NAt4eI"&gt;The Acer Nitro XF273 IPS 1080p monitor is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nZrJOpoF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$210 ($90 off) at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now. It may not be the highest resolution for a monitor of this size, but the 27-inch display offers a fast response rate and up to 165Hz refresh for a low cost. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2ap1uk"&gt;The Beats Flex are $20 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9nHQVA7QG" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $50. Sadly, this used to be the full price of the Flex earbuds, before Apple increased the price to $70 in September. That said, they are still very worthwhile neckbuds at $50. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VEdc1H"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY86472?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt; versions of the 8BitDo Pro 2 Bluetooth controller for the Nintendo Switch, PC, and Mac are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$5 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; when you clip the coupon. That brings this excellent controller down to $45, matching its historical low price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7i3YJT"&gt;Apple’s base model Mac Mini with the M1 processor is down to just &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$570 at Costco&lt;/a&gt;. This member-exclusive price is on the 256GB model, the cheapest option for the tiny Mac that punches well above its weight class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty workers are walking out to protest layoffs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzmFEBER0HQRFRb3DjDRZmozEnM=/17x0:1619x1068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70235548/WZ_OP_FLASHBACK_002.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyfaRn"&gt;Staff at Raven Software, known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, are walking out in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;layoffs of a dozen QA employees on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, as reported by outlets including &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/activision-s-call-of-duty-warzone-qa-team-to-strike-at-raven-software"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-warzone-devs-stage-walkout-over-layoffs-1848165716"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22820273/raven-software-layoffs-walk-out-protest-activision"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Workers are demanding &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRR7-VsS2r-DPqkAgEiAqYwSSlAqC0hc4Se5pjd2c13qJUKkrD4AKTwFgx4IOrrV84aADHW7c6HM7pc/pub"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “every member of the QA team, including those terminated on Friday, must be offered full time positions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPgq2m"&gt;The individuals informed that their contracts would end on January 28th were in “good standing,” the statement says, and many who weren’t laid off are “still unsure about the status of their employment.” The statement also underscores the QA team’s importance to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, Activision’s hugely popular battle royale shooter, which the workers say earns an astounding $5.2 million &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;. “Terminating the contracts of high performing testers in a time of consistent work and profit puts the health of the studio at risk,” the statement says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w92Nq0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today Raven QA, as a department, is demonstrating in protest of the layoffs on Friday. Raven QA's team is essential to the studio's day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1467880080919732227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XeygH"&gt;An Activision Blizzard spokesperson confirmed it has notified 20 “temporary workers” across its studios that their contracts won’t be extended. They declined to break out the numbers by studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7JlUj"&gt;Activision Blizzard has been under intense scrutiny following the state of California’s lawsuit against the company alleging it fostered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;a culture of “constant sexual harassment.”&lt;/a&gt; That scrutiny has only increased following a bombshell &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;has been aware&lt;/a&gt; of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has had his own history of abusive behavior. Employees walked out in protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;following the lawsuit in July&lt;/a&gt; and again after &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; report in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TnLd0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 6th, 12:34PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Activision Blizzard declined to break out how many workers won’t have their contracts extended by studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oSzZdP"&gt;Firefox 95, the latest version of Mozilla’s browser that’s rolling out starting today, introduces a new security feature that’s designed to limit the damage that bugs and security vulnerabilities in its code can cause, &lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/"&gt;Mozilla announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The feature, called &lt;a href="https://plsyssec.github.io/rlbox_sandboxing_api/sphinx/"&gt;RLBox&lt;/a&gt;, was developed with help from researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas, and it was originally released &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-for-mac-and-linux-to-get-a-new-security-sandbox-system/"&gt;as a prototype last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s coming to both the desktop and mobile versions of Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iYa4Yt"&gt;At its core, RLBox is a sandboxing technology, which means that it’s effectively able to isolate code so that any security vulnerabilities it might contain can’t harm the overall system. Sandboxing is a widely used security method across the industry, and browsers already run web content in sandboxed processes to try to stop malicious or buggy sites from compromising the overall browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXouSa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mozilla hopes other programs and browsers adopt the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWksHB"&gt;RLBox differs from this traditional approach, however, and doesn’t have the same costs to performance and memory usage. This makes it possible to sandbox critical browser subcomponents like its spell checker, effectively allowing it to treat them as untrusted code while still running in the same process. This places limits on how code can run or which memory it can access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jB0PO3"&gt;As of today’s release, Firefox is isolating five modules: its Graphite font rendering engine, Hunspell spell checker, Ogg multimedia container format, Expat XML parser, and Woff2 web font compression format. Mozilla says this means if bugs or vulnerabilities are discovered in one of these subcomponents, the Firefox team won’t need to scramble to stop them from compromising the entire browser. “Even a zero-day vulnerability in any of them should pose no threat to Firefox,” Mozilla says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYrnQy"&gt;Mozilla admits that it’s not a catch-all solution and that the approach won’t work everywhere, such as particularly performance-sensitive browser components. But the developer says it hopes to see other browsers and software projects implement the technology and that it intends to use it with more of Firefox’s components in the future. Mozilla has also updated its bug bounty program and will now pay researchers if they’re able to bypass the new sandboxes.&lt;/p&gt;
