    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro could feature Hasselblad-branded cameras  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsINoC9CbBm3zNf2FUSeTF4R3BM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785766/Etj1c86XYAAlZz8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"&gt;Dave2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sY0ow9"&gt;Leaked images of the unannounced OnePlus 9 Pro suggest the flagship smartphone will include a Hasselblad-branded camera array. The images shared in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo"&gt;Dave Lee YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; show four cameras on the rear of the phone. These include wide-angle, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses, the latter of which appears to offer up to a 3.3x optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpmVKw"&gt;At this point it’s unclear exactly what this Hasselblad branding could mean for the OnePlus 9 Pro’s cameras. The Swedish manufacturer, which is majority owned by Chinese company DJI, is best known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977522/hasselblad-camera-factory-tour"&gt;expensive medium format cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and has previously worked with Lenovo on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/31/12729838/hasselblad-true-zoom-announced-moto-z"&gt;modular camera accessory&lt;/a&gt; for Moto Z devices, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1834074858/vertu-signature-touch-comes-with-hasselblad-certified-camera"&gt;Vertu for its Signature Touch&lt;/a&gt; smartphone. Hopefully the presence of its logo means Hasselblad has provided some real camera expertise to OnePlus beyond just brand cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KebC9YVQFq7xAzJJeB1Vxo8e1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288892/Etj1c86XYAAlZz8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"&gt;Dave2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone appears to show four sensors with Hasselblad branding. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaPi35-N0f0we8x1RHW5WKQUW1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288895/msedge_l12Zzj4gLq.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"&gt;Dave2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If accurate, the images show the phone will have a curved display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IcVLnQ"&gt;While Dave Lee outlines three of the phone’s four rear cameras, it’s not obvious what the last sensor might be. Previous OnePlus phones have offered novelties like a &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-8-pro-color-camera-1105842/"&gt;color-filter camera&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-8t-monochrome-camera/"&gt;black-and-while monochrome sensor&lt;/a&gt;. Dave Lee’s video mentions that the phone could have a built-in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography"&gt;tilt-shift photography mode&lt;/a&gt; that could relate to the fourth sensor, but it could equally just be a depth-sensing or macro camera based on OnePlus’ previous phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQRTXL"&gt;Beyond the camera array, the photos shared on the Dave2D channel corroborate a previous leak &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-specs-1195130/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that said the phone will include a curved 1440p 120Hz display. The device shown by Dave Lee appears to have an unusual 11GB of RAM (most other phones have 12GB or 8GB), and 256GB of internal storage. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;separate report&lt;/a&gt; previously claimed the phone will be able to fast-charge at 45W wirelessly, up from the OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless fast-charging speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0uHKC"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is expected to be one of two or even three phones announced by the company next month, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-pro-leak-reveals-huge-camera-upgrade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, we could see the OnePlus 9 (which itself was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;leaked in a series of photos&lt;/a&gt; last December), as well as a more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;OnePlus 9 Lite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel responds to Apple’s M1 chips with cherry-picked benchmarks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfHebaKEb_7gnbvLtZ7nMN8jS_c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785675/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPwR1N"&gt;The PC industry response to Apple’s new M1 chips has been rather quiet, until now. Intel is hitting back at Apple’s new M1 MacBooks with some benchmarks of its own, after early reviews showed impressive performance and battery life from Apple’s ARM-based chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0wO3H"&gt;In benchmarks &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-fires-back-at-apple-m1-processors-with-benchmarks"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Intel compares its 11th Gen Core i7 processor with the M1 CPU found in the latest MacBook Pro. Intel claims its latest chips beat Apple’s M1 performance by 30 percent in overall Chrome browsing tasks, and every one of its carefully selected Office 365 tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GtJ82NGhcpKKS9WA9AGG41A2Ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288889/iqo4nY26fUteofun3KTLv9_2048_80.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s productivity benchmarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1RXp7E"&gt;Intel’s benchmarks also include comparisons between HandBrake transcoding, Adobe Premiere Pro exports, and tasks in both Photoshop and Lightroom Classic. Intel’s 11th Gen chips beat Apple’s M1 in all of these tasks, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gHhsF"&gt;Intel also tested gaming across both chips, mainly to point out that most games aren’t available on macOS. Out of the games tested, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; all run at higher average framerates on the M1, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WuDfu"&gt;This range of benchmarks are clearly cherry picked to favor Intel’s chips, especially as some make use of Intel’s hardware acceleration. Most of the tests aren’t industry standard benchmarks, and Intel even swapped out the MacBook Pro it was testing with a MacBook Air specifically for the battery life tests. Reviewers have regularly found the MacBook Pro battery life to be superior to the MacBook Air and similar Windows laptops, but Intel used the Air for its comparisons to show it only beat PCs by six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6DxaWnAD-mOZWNIx9vfnV6O0fM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288891/ruthcvQsRsqAKfARL9kWV4_2048_80.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s gaming performance benchmarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kq7YNZ"&gt;Intel also argues that PCs offer more choice, better peripheral compatibility, and multi-monitor support. These are particularly valid points, especially when you consider that the M1 MacBook Pro and Air only support a single external display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfHiC4"&gt;What Intel’s hand-picked benchmarks don’t really cover is the experience of using an M1 device compared to existing Intel-based MacBooks. Apple’s latest laptops are silent during most operations, with no loud fans spinning up, impressive battery life, and solid software compatibility. Apple’s processor transition to its own silicon has been surprisingly smooth, and this is just the first generation of chips to make it to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaNCXX"&gt;Intel is clearly concerned by Apple’s first chips, and we’re now waiting for the company to respond with its own processors instead of benchmarks. The entire PC industry will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;need to respond to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;laptop sales are growing&lt;/a&gt;. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, looks set to battle Apple’s M1 chips in the years ahead, and he’s already made it clear that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;Intel has to beat Apple in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk pledges $100 million for new X Prize carbon removal competition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Visits Germany" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tX2eU7YJauD2YQTQaW56ulvzE_o=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785621/1288829858.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBaBOq"&gt;Elon Musk is putting up $100 million as part of a new X Prize Foundation competition focused on carbon removal technology. The contest, announced Monday morning, will run for four years and is open to teams around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlIy8k"&gt;Fifteen teams will be selected for the competition within 18 months. They will each get $1 million, and 25 separate $200,000 scholarships will be given to student teams who enter. The grand prize winner will be awarded $50 million, second place will receive $20 million, and third place will get $10 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP4Wok"&gt;Winners will have to “demonstrate a solution that can pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans and lock it away permanently in an environmentally benign way,” according to the X Prize Foundation. Judges will be looking for solutions that could remove one ton of CO2 per day that can scale to gigaton levels. Full competition guidelines will be published on April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCSyxr"&gt;“We want to make a truly meaningful impact. Carbon negativity, not neutrality,” Musk says in a statement. “This is not a theoretical competition; we want teams that will build real systems that can make a measurable impact and scale to a gigaton level. Whatever it takes. Time is of the essence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IhysU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Time is of the essence.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snjdCh"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1352392678177034242"&gt;first announced that he was donating money towards a prize in January&lt;/a&gt;, not long after he passed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;to become the richest person in the world&lt;/a&gt;. When that happened, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO asked his millions of Twitter followers for “ways to donate money that really make a difference.” The $100 million is coming from Musk’s own foundation. This donation &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221173/elon-musk-tesla-foundation-philanthropy-wealthiest-person"&gt;roughly doubles the amount he has publicly given away&lt;/a&gt; to date through the Musk Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crFJLk"&gt;Carbon removal technology is an expensive idea that’s still unproven at scale, with options ranging from funding reforestation projects to physically pulling the greenhouse gas out of the air. But it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/19/9174589/climate-change-carbon-removal-capture-air"&gt;become fashionable&lt;/a&gt; as the world heats up. It’s especially popular among major corporations. Last year, Stripe made it possible for businesses that use its payment processing platform to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537247/stripe-customers-carbon-capture-projects-climate-change"&gt;funnel portions of their proceeds towards the development of carbon removal&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlPy6a"&gt;Perhaps most notably, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it wanted to capture the equivalent of all the carbon dioxide it’s ever emitted. The company pledged $1 billion toward the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfhIE7"&gt;Last month, we got the first glimpse at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;the slight progress Microsoft has made toward that goal&lt;/a&gt;. The company purchased contracts to capture 1.3 million metric tons of CO2, or just 11 percent of its total emissions for 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit bought a five-second Super Bowl spot celebrating GameStock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3cI8lD_kaSkdQef9dnRNt9XcU_0=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785053/reddit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jfgv5h"&gt;You could have been forgiven for missing Reddit’s Super Bowl ad tonight — it was only five seconds long. The ad mostly consisted of a text message that would’ve been pretty difficult to read in the moment, claiming that the company spent its “entire marketing budget on five seconds of airtime.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgoZcs"&gt;“One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish anything when they come together around a common idea,” Reddit says by way of explanation, in a clear nod to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;GameStop stocks saga&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;driven by posters on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. “Who knows, maybe you’ll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on ‘tendies.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vWCwFh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What just happened? &lt;a href="https://t.co/DypRp6DeQt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DypRp6DeQt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Reddit (@reddit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1358572629729320960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jmIYxG"&gt;You can watch the ad above, but here’s the full text in case it’s too small on your phone screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLBk2"&gt;Wow, this actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVeHPq"&gt;If you’re reading this, it means our bet paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyTNIm"&gt;Big game spots are expensive, so we couldn’t buy a full one. But we were inspired and decided to spend our entire marketing budget on 5 seconds of airtime. One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish anything when they come together around a common idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIRa32"&gt;Who knows, maybe you’ll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on “tendies.” Maybe you’ll help r/SuperbOwl teach the world about the majesty of owls. Maybe you’ll even pause this 5-second ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzdkGw"&gt;Powerful things happen when people rally around something they really care about. And there’s a place for that. It’s called Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Hyundai and Kia downplay Apple car rumors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtyJah8ZmEBm-GjkmgmDzgzEYiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784985/akrales_180329_2351_1103.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E24ucx"&gt;After weeks of speculation, Hyundai and subsidiary Kia have again sought to downplay rumors and reporting that they are working with Apple on an autonomous electric car project. The companies say they are no longer in talks, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-tech-apple-hyundai-motor/hyundai-motor-kia-say-they-are-not-in-talks-with-apple-on-autonomous-car-development-idUSS6N2J9020"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/apple-talks-with-hyundai-kia-on-electric-car-paused-recently"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, though that doesn’t mean the discussions won’t reopen later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjjot"&gt;Hyundai’s comments as reported by Bloomberg are essentially the same as what the company said last month in a statement that mentioned Apple before being confusingly walked back. The carmaker says it’s been discussing potential autonomous electric car projects with various partners but is yet to reach a decision. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/apple-talks-with-hyundai-kia-on-electric-car-paused-recently"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that the talks with Apple had “paused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJdq1t"&gt;Renowned Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; that the company does indeed plan to use Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for its first electric vehicle and use Kia for US-based manufacturing, though even then he doesn’t expect the car to hit the market before 2025. Whatever the state of Apple and Hyundai’s negotiations, then, the project is unlikely to be unveiled any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CBS All Access app had technical difficulties at the start of the Super Bowl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CBS logo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8AshmSXYwzy46uGHB5vHO14ZzA=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784702/cbs-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6e8Wv"&gt;CBS All Access app appeared to be having problems as users tried to watch Super Bowl LV on Sunday. Users reported seeing an error message that read the app was “experiencing technical difficulties” and that “an error has occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHGKjL"&gt;Down Detector showed a &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/cbs_all_access/"&gt;spike in complaints&lt;/a&gt; for CBS All Access at around 6PM ET Sunday. Numerous users were complaining on Twitter that they could not see the game at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHXL3D"&gt;Todd Spangler of &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reported shortly after 7PM ET that CBS was telling subscribers the issues were resolved and to restart the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL4JNH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GBQT2C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CBS All Access crashed right around &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperBowl?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperBowl&lt;/a&gt; kickoff time, it's now telling subscribers "The reported technical issues with the service have been resolved, please restart your CBS All Access app and you can now return to streaming."&lt;/p&gt;— Todd Spangler (@xpangler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xpangler/status/1358568845867376640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TG58gh"&gt;It was the worst possible timing for the app to be unavailable as the Super Bowl between Kansas City and Tampa Bay was getting underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovbIa2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: February 7th, 7:18PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that the app should be working for most users. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailer for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier premieres during Super Bowl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZOOxnWu06snDWjJF5z2y_DnTVCU=/95x0:664x379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784750/falcon.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel/Disney Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LJzmNA"&gt;We had an inkling that there might be big movie news during the Super Bowl and there was: Marvel released a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, a six-episode series that debuts on Disney Plus March 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGSxoB"&gt;The show takes place after the events of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Rogers has retired from as Captain America, in an attempt to live a simple life in an alternate reality with his love, Peggy Carter. Sam Wilson (Falcon) has picked up the Captain’s shield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3DUNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KL1OHB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWBsDaFWyTE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dywdhq"&gt;The show had been delayed a few times, and fans have only been able to see a brief, 30-second teaser before now. Filming shut down in March because of the pandemic, Disney said at the time, and was forced to remain shut down until a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRfEUQ"&gt;The trailer opens with our heroes being interviewed in what looks like a jail cell, and a therapist (?) asking “Mr. Barnes, why does Sam aggravate you?” Ha. Much jumping out of planes and flying around, shield-throwing and kicking of bad guys ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JlQp"&gt;Check out the trailer above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHdA6o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZW1qm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Nevers, Pacific Rim: The Black, Moxie, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H3EljnMQtoOnO1h-V8pIJKUu4yc=/174x0:1427x835/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784167/pacific_rim_dark.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umtOGzti-XQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mbTCdY"&gt;So I watched the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;Servant&lt;/em&gt; and can’t decide whether it’s the slow pacing or the suspension of disbelief (how long can Julian and Sean keep up the plot’s central ruse before they do real damage to Dorothy?) keeping it from being genuinely frightening. I won’t spoil the latest episode, but it feels like for all the disconcerting camera angles and Dorothy’s bizarre behavior, this week’s episode didn’t move the needle all that much. I’m hanging in there, but I think the show needs M. Night Shyamalan to ramp up the scary a li’l bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psLsji"&gt;This week’s trailers include a little sci-fi, some teen empowerment, and the third in the &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; franchise, this time an anime flick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yT3gBC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWdpBQFgdxQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u6bpwU"&gt;The Nevers &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DswgeF"&gt;A group of women in Victorian-era London develop special powers and fight the forces of— yes, OK, yes, got it. In the language of the show, the women are called Touched and regarded as weirdos. Joss Whedon, creator of the &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer &lt;/em&gt;series, is still credited as creator and executive producer even though he departed the production and HBO in November amid an &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/warner-bros-ray-fisher-declined-to-speak-to-investigator.html"&gt;investigation into his conduct&lt;/a&gt; as director of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;. Laura Donnelly, Olivia Williams, and Ann Skelly star in &lt;em&gt;The Nevers&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts on HBO Max in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OS0cTs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umtOGzti-XQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RCVwOx"&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wes9b9"&gt;I’m trying to think of another movie franchise where the first two were live action and the third is anime (I don’t think &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-vers&lt;/em&gt;e quite meets that description but man did I love that movie. Anyway!). The world of &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt;— Jaegers and Kaiju— returns with the story of two siblings left behind after Australia is overrun by Kaiju, as the two search for their missing parents. &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black&lt;/em&gt; is a series of seven 30-minute episodes, which arrives on Netflix March 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="empvAp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ezhm_9ehXU4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wWG4ev"&gt;Punky Brewster &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uXPezH"&gt;The original iteration of this show was about a spunky orphan who gets taken in by a crusty older dude who needs some cheer in his life. In other words, a very 1980s sitcom with a very cute kid. The new version of the show has Soleil Moon Frye reprising the role of Punky, this time as a divorced mother of three who meets a foster child who— sitcom plot twist— reminds Punky of herself as a kid. Sure, why not. Cherie Johnson reprises her role as Punky’s best friend Cherie, and Freddie Prinze, Jr. stars as Punky’s ex-husband. &lt;em&gt;Punky Brewster&lt;/em&gt; comes to Peacock February 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FOBRKk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sf34qI1hjKU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kEAMGv"&gt;Moxie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CunrLX"&gt;Based on the novel by Jennifer Mathieu, &lt;em&gt;Moxie&lt;/em&gt; about shy high school student Vivian (Hadley Robinson) whose mom (Amy Poehler) was a rebel back in the day (“When I was 16, all I cared about was smashing the patriarchy”). The boys at Vivian’s high school are rude jerks who rate the girls based on their looks. She and the other girls at the school finally get fed up, and Vivian publishes a zine called Moxie to expose the bad behavior. Right on. Poehler also directed &lt;em&gt;Moxie, &lt;/em&gt;which hits Netflix on March 3rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOdv33"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction February 7th, 4:01PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; This story originally published with an incorrect title for “Pacific Rim: The Black.” We regret the error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAndL1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCVXlb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Police in Minneapolis reportedly used a geofence warrant at Floyd protest last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kqg_9HeYZ9fqYc07hvx9q1UAbIQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68783183/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Police in Minneapolis got a search warrant that ordered Google to provide account data on people who were near a protest that turned violent two days after the killing of George Floyd last year, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4mjNd"&gt;The search warrant required Google to provide account data for anyone “within the geographical region” of an AutoZone store on May 27th, 2020, to police, according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. Photos of a protest outside that store two days after Floyd’s death showed a man in a mask smashing the store windows with an umbrella. The &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/police-umbrella-man-was-a-white-supremacist-trying-to-incite-floyd-rioting/571932272/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minneapolis Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported at the time&lt;/a&gt; that police believed the so-called “Umbrella Man” was actually a white supremacist trying to spark violence at the protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GiFf2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, a police affidavit showed Minneapolis police were seeking information about the identity of “Umbrella Man,” who they considered responsible for sparking violence at what had been peaceful protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9NP58"&gt;Geofence warrants, also known as reverse-location warrants, allow authorities to sweep up location data from GPS, Bluetooth, and wi-fi from devices near a crime scene. They often pull in information from people who had nothing to do with the crime, and have&lt;a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/publications/letter-google-geofence-and-keyword-warrants"&gt; raised privacy concerns&lt;/a&gt;. A Florida man who used a fitness app to track his bike rides briefly found himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/7/21169533/florida-google-runkeeper-geofence-police-privacy"&gt;a suspect in a 2019 burglary,&lt;/a&gt; when police used a geofence warrant. The man had unknowingly provided information about his location to Google, which placed him near the scene of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NK0sk6"&gt;The use of geofence warrants has increased in the past several years; in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-chatrie-google-amicus-brief-geofence-warrant"&gt;Google reported&lt;/a&gt; the number of such warrants it had received was up 1,500 percent between 2017 and 2018, but did not provide specific numbers. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that Google received &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html"&gt;as many as 180 geofence warrants&lt;/a&gt; in one week in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jwWBX"&gt;A Minneapolis resident told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; he had received an email from Google informing him that information from his account was subject to the warrant and was being given to police. The man said he was filming the protest, not participating in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkqE69"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Sony’s PS5 designers turned PlayStation into something you can feel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fl4IdCrIk0Cd9SITGXByb2QjZkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68782941/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Every DualSense controller has 40,000 tiny PlayStation symbols&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="PVXqbD"&gt;When my colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;reviewed the PlayStation 5,&lt;/a&gt; he explained how Sony’s next-generation of video games is something you can’t see — you have to &lt;em&gt;touch&lt;/em&gt;. Part of that is how the amazing DualSense controller’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21547303/sony-ps5-dualsense-adaptive-triggers-haptics-teardown-features"&gt;clever motorized triggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;intensely precise vibrations&lt;/a&gt; can recreate the crunching sensation of strutting across a sandy beach or the pitter-patter of rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWEUsW"&gt;Another part: the &lt;em&gt;40,000 tiny PlayStation symbols &lt;/em&gt;you’ll feel when you pick up the PS5’s new gamepad. As an Easter egg for its fans, the company decided to apply a microtexture to the DualSense controller’s entire lower shell that makes it Sony’s most grippable gamepad yet, because of the thousands upon thousands of tiny squares, triangles, circles and crosses literally at your fingertips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="wsWpqO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10324032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UW4RzF"&gt;Sony hasn’t previously spoken about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it did this, how many there are, or how large the symbols actually get, but we have those answers today — including behind-the-scenes photos and details from Sony’s Yujin Morisawa and Takeshi Igarashi, the chief designers behind the PS5 and the DualSense respectively. (We even borrowed a fancy industrial microscope so you can see how the symbols look up close.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzft5B"&gt;Perhaps the most striking part, as you’ll see in images above and below: these tiny symbols are stacked on top of each other, jutting out in three dimensions. They’re not a single, evenly-spaced layer at all, like the tiny dots you might remember on Sony’s DualShock 4 from 2013. They look random, almost organic — which might be because the entire design was sketched out by hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgqhNZH1vhwNBTBolstW18YN7oI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22286810/1.___________.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A study of various microtexture sketches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajtSQo"&gt;And not just one sketch. Morisawa, the Senior Art Director of Sony’s Design Center Product Design Group, explains that a variety of designs were hand-crafted, digitized, mocked up, applied to actual prototype gamepads, and tested over and over again until the teams found the balance they wanted: good-looking, textured enough to be comfortable and non-slip, but not so sandpaper-rough that it’d hurt your hands over a lengthy gaming session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDIbsT"&gt;While designers could easily place the digital version of the texture wherever they wanted in Sony’s CAD programs, Morisawa says that physically comparing and testing different prototypes was key: “While it takes a considerable amount of time to create a prototype, the ‘go/no-go’ judgment of a product is determined the moment you see it and touch it,” he told us by email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NW4FBVs1NYAHFbUTkB0I3qd02ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22286811/2.______________1.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wPm4kb"&gt;Figuring out the proper heights of the symbols was a lot of work all by itself, as you can see in some of Sony’s behind-the-scenes photos. In the end, they settled on two layers — one roughly 15 microns tall, and another 30 microns tall, according to measurements we made with a Nikon LV100 microscope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger symbols are roughly half a millimeter wide, and the upper layer are just 30 microns (three hundredths of a millimeter) tall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ALkfHmWH0dPrzP60b1lgWgiHphE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22286782/20210203_Sean_Hollister_Verge_6.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One downside of the texture: it picks up dirt extremely easily and doesn’t want to let go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8oJVjL"&gt;Actually applying the symbols to the DualSense gamepad was the easy part — because they’re not applied at all. Each and every one of those 40,000 symbols is part of the controller’s shell, created when beads of molten ABS plastic are squeezed into tiny laser-cut crevices during the standard injection-molding process. The design is optimized to keep the symbols intact as they're popped out of the mold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaTp08"&gt;The trick is having the right equipment to make that mold to start. To create such precise shapes across an entire three-dimensional curved surface, meant to fit into your palms, lasers came in handy. Specifically, a high-end, multi-axis laser engraving machine that Igarashi says is “hard to come by.” The upshot? Because it’s part of the mold, the texture you’ll feel on the PS5’s controller is the same exact one every other owner will. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OeMlC"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation controller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20978071/playstation-dualshock-controllers-modern-shape-design-ps5-25th-anniversary"&gt;has arguably defined decades of gamepads&lt;/a&gt;, so it was no surprise when, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;Google’s Stadia Controller&lt;/a&gt; came with the same kind of stippled texture that Sony introduced with the DualShock 4 in 2013. But this time around, Sony’s microtexture isn’t just for your hands; the barely-there PlayStation symbols are part of the PS5 experience wherever you’d think to look. You’ll find them on both of the PS5 console’s side panels, on the inner lip. They adorn the grips of the PS5’s optional media remote, the DualSense charging station, the PS5 camera, and Sony’s Pulse 3D wireless headset, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gE4dG"&gt;They even appear inside at least one game: &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;the must-play PS5 pack-in&lt;/a&gt;, prominently uses the texture on a number of floors and walls. It makes sense. Not only is &lt;em&gt;Astro&lt;/em&gt; a celebration of the company’s history in gaming, it’s chock-full of PlayStation easter eggs including a few that poke good-natured fun at Sony itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The “serial numbers” of Astro’s gadgets pay homage to key Sony figures like &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/16/11242372/playstation-vr-shuhei-yoshida-interview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shuhei Yoshida&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HVuOyt"&gt;In the PS3 era, Sony often felt arrogant, a little too sure fans would lap up whatever it had to offer — $599 consoles featuring &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/e3-sony-2006-giant-enemy-crab"&gt;giant enemy crabs&lt;/a&gt;, proprietary discs and memory sticks for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20991654/psp-vita-portable-playstation-console-sony-25-anniversary"&gt;its ambitious portables&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/4/27/2977903/playstation-all-star-battle-royale"&gt;Smash Bros. competitor&lt;/a&gt; without enough beloved video game franchises to back it up — but PlayStation has not only earned loads of goodwill since then,  it’s become more self-aware. If the company can stay that way throughout the PS5’s lifecycle (and, you know, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;let people actually buy one&lt;/a&gt;), I have little doubt it’ll be a winner. &lt;/p&gt;
