    <title>China censored social media posts about Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d4pHVL"&gt;The news of Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win for Best Director has been censored on social media and search engines in China at the direction of the country’s propaganda ministry, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-censors-nomadland-director-chloe-zhaos-oscar-win-11619440550?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Zhao, who was born in Beijing, is the first Chinese woman and first woman of color to take home the Academy Award for directing. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22403117/oscars-2021-winners-losers-nomadland-anthony-hopkins-chadwick-boseman-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; also won Best Picture&lt;/a&gt; at Sunday night’s awards ceremony, and the movie’s star, Frances McDormand, won Best Actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWIC4J"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, early messages congratulating Zhao had been scrubbed from Chinese social media sites by midday Monday, and searches on Chinese search engines Baidu and Sogou had few links to the Oscar news. There was no news about Zhao’s win on China Central Television, the &lt;em&gt;Xinhua News Agency&lt;/em&gt;, or the Chinese Communist Party’s &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported; according to a state media reporter, the country’s propaganda ministry told the outlets not to report the win due to “previous public opinion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vaaSu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Global Times&lt;/em&gt;, a news site owned by &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222108.shtml"&gt;posted an op-ed late Monday&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging Zhao’s win but criticizing &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; as “typically American and far from the real life of the Chinese people.” Of Zhao, the &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote: “We hope she can become more and more mature. In an era when the China-US confrontation is intensifying, she can play a mediating role in the two societies and avoid being a friction point. She cannot escape her special label, and she should actively use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T009IK"&gt;Another of the few news stories that did surface in China about Zhao’s win came from small news site 163.com, which called Zhao the “second Chinese filmmaker to win the best director Oscar, after Ang Lee,” &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chloe-zhaos-oscars-glory-met-with-media-silence-in-china"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lee, who won Best Director twice, for &lt;em&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/em&gt; in 2006 and for&lt;em&gt; Life of Pi&lt;/em&gt; in 2013, was born in Taiwan. China considers Taiwan to be part of China, a matter of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538"&gt;some contention internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8qtiX"&gt;It’s not the first time &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; and its director have been hidden by Chinese media; last month, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/beijing-media-social-media-asia-chloe-zhao-c7aa576fd66d66204ec37371196ea569"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that social media posts and other publicity about the movie were removed by China’s censors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJZTT4"&gt;The reason for China’s erasure of Zhao’s win likely stems from her comments in Western media outlets. She said in a 2013 interview with &lt;em&gt;Filmmaker&lt;/em&gt; magazine that China was a “place where there are lies everywhere,” a comment that was later removed from that article, according to the &lt;em&gt;AP, &lt;/em&gt;but not before it drew considerable backlash in China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku could lose YouTube TV in standoff with Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n9R174f6TvqgPwTqou31dtHyPU4=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187150/20151026-roku-4-tv-4k-14.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csNCoI"&gt;The YouTube TV app could disappear from Roku devices in the coming days, according to an email sent to subscribers on Monday. In a last-ditch effort, Roku is calling on subscribers to reach out to Google to “urge them” to reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cc4U7"&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Roku accused Google of attempting to control the platform’s user experience in a way that favors its own products as the two companies negotiate a contract renewal for YouTube TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3aPSr"&gt;“Google is attempting to use its YouTube monopoly position to force Roku into accepting predatory, anti-competitive and discriminatory terms that will directly harm Roku and our users,” a Roku spokesperson said in a statement Monday. “It should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms that harm Roku’s users.”​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CwJrNp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GePG1N"&gt;According to Roku, Google’s demands condition Roku’s access to host the YouTube TV app on providing preferential treatment for Google’s separate YouTube app. These demands include providing Google with special access to consumer data and for Roku to build a dedicated search result row for YouTube in the platform’s interface. In addition, Google has called for Roku to meet specific hardware specs, Roku said. Google has its own Chromecast device that competes directly with Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjxXiU"&gt;While smaller than Google as a company, Roku currently controls nearly 45 percent of set-top box viewing time and has significant leverage over apps as a result. When HBO Max failed to secure a deal with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280279/roku-hbo-max-dispute-streaming-connected-tvs-amazon-fire-apple-channels-warnermedia"&gt;for its launch last summer&lt;/a&gt;, the gap was seen as a significant hurdle for the new service — and a minor inconvenience for Roku itself. Still, Roku insists it is not seeking any additional money from the YouTube TV partnership and that its only goal is avoiding terms that favor Chromecast hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXDnGw"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v66pyC"&gt;Roku’s blistering allegations come amid a series of massive antitrust investigations into Google by the Justice Department, state attorneys general, and Congress. Last week, Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel regarding the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Play Store and the fees it charges&lt;/a&gt; to app developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scHXFP"&gt;“Google is already under fire from governments around the world for manipulating search results,” the Roku spokesperson said. “It is outrageous that Google would now try to insist on manipulating Roku’s search results as well.”​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ahw8A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa0EhF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at playing Steam PC games on Xbox with mouse and keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m74zKArdUICtsmKR6cxjh_0QuJY=/1x0:2058x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187147/steamxboxgames.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TMug4E"&gt;Microsoft’s new Chromium-based Edge browser is coming to Xbox soon, and the company has now added all-important mouse and keyboard support that will pave the way to stream PC games to Xbox consoles. Xbox testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring are now able to access this new version of Edge and try out a mouse in the console version of the browser for the first time. I’ve been testing this new support over the weekend, and I’ve even managed to play some Steam PC games on my Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9mLTv"&gt;Despite a few obvious bugs here and there — as this is very much an early beta browser — it works as expected. I’ve been able to write documents using Word online, type messages into Discord chats, and even play some &lt;a href="https://krunker.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.quakejs.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake JS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the browser with a mouse and keyboard. Basic mouse navigation, scrolling, and right-click all work here just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGq6rh3CtX55loi8vsUjO0WU6iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470549/krunkerxbox.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker on an Xbox with mouse and keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk2WaR"&gt;Where things really get interesting is when you consider what this will mean for the future of streaming games to an Xbox through a browser. Currently, I can stream Google Stadia games and use mouse and keyboard on the Xbox, but I’ve also been able to successfully stream PC games from Steam to an Xbox through the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWWVTV"&gt;I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DOTA 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a bunch of other PC games that simply aren’t available on Xbox right now. I’ve been able to do this using &lt;a href="https://parsec.app/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially a remote desktop app that lets you stream what’s on your PC to a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXqwQC"&gt;It’s not the most ideal experience on the Xbox right now, as the virtual keyboard appears when you click, and latency / connectivity isn’t always the best, but it’s a good example of what’s possible with this new mouse and keyboard support. Microsoft’s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1384154390630592521"&gt;recently committed&lt;/a&gt; to bringing full PC games to the Xbox through the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0WkIRmjt26mGzNnkM8_AqBvvmW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470553/F6JN32q.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remote-control a PC using Microsoft Edge on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wryiPu"&gt;We don’t know exactly when those PC games will arrive on xCloud, as right now, Microsoft is only currently publicly testing Xbox games via the browser using either a controller or touch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFIaPd"&gt;This new Edge browser with full mouse and keyboard support simply opens up a lot of opportunities for the Xbox to access games that aren’t typically available on the console. That even includes accessing Sony’s PC ports like &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;, and more if you stream them to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMrI7p"&gt;For now, we’re waiting on Microsoft to finalize this Edge browser and make it available to all Xbox owners, and for services like Nvidia’s GeForce Now to stop blocking Edge so the dream of playing PC games on Xbox consoles is a step closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days, and in iOS 14.5, which is starting to roll out to the public today, there are new privacy features that may make you feel happier but are not endearing Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;The new feature is aptly called App Tracking Transparency. Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The new version of iOS allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you won’t have to do anything; you’ll be automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track, and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q8mGj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA5RTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get the Microsoft Surface Headphones new for just $82 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmVo6lpvWKyH_cxTZtxfiBUnU-U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186658/jbareham_181114_3083_0085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqu74z"&gt;Microsoft’s first-gen Surface Headphones might not be the latest set of noise-canceling headphones, but they’re still a stellar value — especially today. They have good sound quality, USB-C charging, a comfy fit, and they can block out a considerable amount of noise. Today at Woot, you can get them new for just over $80. To get this price, you’ll need to download the Woot app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;), then find the deal there. Doing that alone will save 15 percent on the price it’ll cost everyone else, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13142085?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-headphones-10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $96&lt;/a&gt;. These headphones used to cost $250 (and most competitors cost more than that), so you’re getting a good deal either way. If you have Amazon Prime, you’ll get free shipping on this order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5Nl0g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10373885"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qXakuu"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra with 256GB of internal storage in the phantom black colorway is steeply discounted at Amazon. Normally $1,250, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,000 right now&lt;/a&gt;. The best part of this deal is that this model comes with upgraded storage, yet it’s no more expensive than the base configuration that has 128GB of storage. Most Samsung phones before this have had a microSD card slot to make adding space possible, but this generation of Galaxy phones doesn’t have one. So, you’re stuck with the amount of storage your S21 has, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fn8rAw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcdJsZYVwcnrPjY_HZu2WoF6GH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989891/dseifert_201025_4263_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sCXhYQ"&gt;Amazon’s latest Echo Dot smart speaker that’s more spherical than previous models (and better-sounding, too) is 40 percent off through Amazon, Target, and Best Buy. Normally $50, you can snag one for $30 in blue, white, or black. My colleague Dan Seifert noted in his review that these have “surprisingly good sound quality” and that it’s just as capable as other Alexa-powered smart speakers, but for a cheaper price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="clNmTB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;Beats Flex&lt;/a&gt; wireless earbuds are even easier to recommend when they’re $10 off, as they are now at Amazon. Normally $50, you can get either the all-black or the neon yellow colorways &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L6ZYW21?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $40&lt;/a&gt;. These are Beats’ first headphones that charge via USB-C, which makes them a great set of earbuds for Android users. Though, if you’re on an iPhone, these can quickly pair to your device with its W1 wireless chip.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is building its own in-app podcast player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X0sdRSYQLTpGioM_yK4VYPUHHfQ=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186904/fbpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QoKttN"&gt;Facebook is building its own in-app podcast player, the company confirmed today. This will be separate from its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399965/spotify-facebook-integration-mini-player-music-podcasts"&gt;in-app Spotify player&lt;/a&gt;. Podcasters will be able to distribute their shows through their Facebook page and will opt into doing so. The exact product details are still unclear. It’s possible this will operate through RSS or that creators will have a backend way to upload their content to Facebook. This functionality is expected to roll out within the next “few months,” according to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;a Facebook blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2pgkO"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the Spotify partnership as being primarily about “music” during a chat with &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; writer Casey Newton last week. But Spotify’s release about its Facebook miniplayer today &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-26/share-explore-and-discover-music-and-podcasts-via-spotify-in-the-facebook-app/"&gt;specifically calls out&lt;/a&gt; its use case for podcasts. People can share episodes and listen to them from within the Facebook app without actually navigating to Spotify. But Facebook apparently has other plans to be more ingrained in the podcasting ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENfjQG"&gt;The company’s interest in podcasts makes sense. It says more than 170 million people connect to podcast pages, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around shows. Plus, podcasts are still primarily an ad-based product, meaning Facebook could gather data about shows and listeners and target its own ads against them, possibly giving creators a cut. It could also offer creators a way to put them behind a subscription paywall, similarly to Apple’s forthcoming Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s formal entry into the podcast player space would mean nearly all the tech giants run their own podcast products, including Apple, Google, and Amazon, on top of Spotify and other smaller apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZ20rj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peter Thiel is spending $10 million to back a business partner’s Senate bid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Thiel Marks Palantirs Asia Push with $150 Million Japan Venture" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cHbuYajbCi7M44vRcc6u-NCEu2U=/0x0:3404x2269/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186798/1183198458.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LN6aum"&gt;Venture capitalist Peter Thiel has put $10 million into a newly formed PAC backing a business partner’s Senate bid, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/26/peter-thiel-arizona-senate-race-484585"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Formed on April 19th, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470235/202104199443809051.pdf"&gt;the Saving Arizona PAC&lt;/a&gt; is taking aim at the state’s 2022 Senate race, which will see former astronaut Mark Kelly defending his seat for the Democrats. According to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;, the PAC will support Thiel Capital executive Blake Masters in the Republican primary and general election, putting him at an immediate fundraising advantage in one of the most closely watched races of the cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIsocx"&gt;Masters came to prominence as the co-author of Thiel’s popular book, &lt;em&gt;Zero to One, &lt;/em&gt;and was hired shortly afterward as an executive at Thiel Capital. The book originated as Masters’ notes from a class Thiel taught at Stanford, &lt;a href="https://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup"&gt;published on Masters’ Tumblr-hosted blog in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. He has never held public office; his most significant government experience is a four-month stint clerking at a US Attorney’s office in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgyENY"&gt;Masters did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KOIgW"&gt;A longtime critic of liberal values, Thiel has been particularly aligned with the US Republican party since 2016, when he was an enthusiastic and public supporter of former President Trump and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUTnOQZOYv0"&gt;spoke in support of Trump&lt;/a&gt; at the Republican National Convention. Thiel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21312154/peter-thiel-trump-2020-election-campaign-shying-away-distancing"&gt;reportedly chose to distance himself&lt;/a&gt; from Trump after the COVID-19 crisis but has remained an active donor for Republican candidates. In a 2020 Kansas Senate race, Thiel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21331900/peter-thiel-kris-kobach-kansas-senate-primary-immigration-facebook"&gt;donated $850,000 in support of Kris Kobach&lt;/a&gt;, notorious for advocating a “Muslim registry” in the early days of the Trump administration. (Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21352787/kris-kobach-loss-kansas-primary-peter-thiel-backing-roger-marshall-immigration"&gt;the bid was unsuccessful&lt;/a&gt;.) In the 2022 cycle, Thiel also &lt;a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/03/15/super-pac-supporting-possible-ohio-senate-candidate-j-d-vance-gets-10-m-donation-peter-thiel/4700540001/"&gt;donated $10 million&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy &lt;/em&gt;author JD Vance’s push for a Senate seat in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Lsw5t"&gt;The Republican candidate in 2022 will be facing off against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), who joined the Senate after a special election in 2020. Husband of former US Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), Kelly has been outspoken on issues of climate and health care, pledging to bring a renewed focus on data and science to the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuhnIj"&gt;“When you are trying to make these hard decisions, it’s important to look at the data,” Kelly told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18299733/mark-kelly-nasa-astronaut-space-shuttle-senate-arizona-election"&gt;in an interview in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. “We sometimes elect people who have beliefs that are just not true and are not rooted in reality and facts.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUyYSgymDdoqMNr7dFj2B-0p0AY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186722/vpavic_4261_20201023_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The latest TVs can really showcase what these consoles are capable of&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="NztlxY"&gt;We’re several months into the next generation of console gaming with the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. And if you didn’t upgrade the TV that you’re playing on &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; buying a new console — first off, congrats on finding one — now is as good a time as any. The latest 2021 TV models from LG, Samsung, Sony, and other companies are now shipping, and many of them are optimized for HDMI 2.1 and gaming features like variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and buttery-smooth 120Hz action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAk1Ab"&gt;HDMI 2.1 was still experiencing early growing pains last year, with some TVs offering a mixed bag of features that omitted things like VRR or ALLM. But it seems like TV makers have done much better with their 2021 lineups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1BJFj"&gt;Our top picks for the best gaming TV for PS5 and best gaming TV for Xbox satisfy two main criteria: they stand out from the pack for their gaming chops and next-gen feature support, but they also put out a phenomenal picture for video entertainment like Netflix, Disney Plus, or whatever else you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEUMFNw11NJZPLYyPF6hopwqPoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470211/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_8.41.29_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s G1 OLED is the best gaming TV for the Xbox Series X / S and PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zMvIRP"&gt;1. LG G1 OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bI7dCv"&gt;The absolute best gaming TV for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xY5p0W"&gt;Thanks to its more efficient inner workings and panel advancements, the G1 can get brighter than any of LG’s past OLEDs. This results in brighter HDR highlights for movies, TV shows, and gaming. But it still retains the perfect blacks and phenomenal viewing angles that OLED is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw2yyP"&gt;In 2021, LG has also put a bigger focus on gamers in the TV’s settings menu. There’s a new “Game Optimizer” dashboard that provides quick access to settings like VRR — and you can pick between different game genres for the TV to automatically apply the ideal picture optimizations. Vincent Teoh at &lt;em&gt;HDTVtest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/05meraExYc4"&gt;did a great review of the G1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Olsl9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462536"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVXos2"&gt;The G1 is meant to be mounted on a wall; it doesn’t come with traditional stands by default. But it sits practically flush with the included specially designed wall mount that efficiently routes attached cables, so the mounting process is definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PW4LFD"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CY-qzhaX_QwRRse0Tvyuzi7oFy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22469171/DSCF3674.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG CX was ahead of its time in how well it showcased the next-gen consoles. And yes, I know I need to mount it and get the soundbar out of the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jUPAVQ"&gt;2. LG CX OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7GwAgu"&gt;Best deal on a gaming TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxVq1"&gt;Last year’s CX-series OLEDs from LG were the best bet for people who wanted a TV that could get the most from their new PS5 or Xbox on day one. The CX line has since been succeeded by 2021’s C1 models, but I think “settling” for the 2020 LG OLED is a much smarter move for the money. You get all the key gaming features: 120Hz, VRR (including G-Sync and FreeSync), and ALLM. And every HDMI port on the CX is HDMI 2.1, which still can’t be said for some of 2021’s best TVs. That means you can plug in both an Xbox Series X or S and PS5 without losing any next-gen enhancements on either machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmRlCu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5PFK2W"&gt;You’ll save a lot of money choosing the CX over something like the G1 or C1. And unless you’re a stickler for brightness, I think you’ll be very pleased with the fantastic OLED picture quality of last year’s mainstream LG set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="audHUQ"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s QN90A, the best LCD gaming TV, has a Game Bar that includes important features for PS5 and Xbox gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hOYel4"&gt;3. Samsung Neo QLED QN90A&lt;br&gt;The best LCD TV for next-gen PlayStation and Xbox gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRmKyc"&gt;Samsung’s new QN90A series is the company’s first TVs to use Mini LED technology, which swaps out the standard full-array backlighting system for a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; more smaller LEDs crammed into the same space. This results in dramatically better contrast, even higher brightness — and LCD TVs were already beating OLED here — and less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O5pdBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2yXzC"&gt;Like LG, Samsung is also paying special attention to gamers this year with a “Game Bar” that lets you quickly adjust the screen’s aspect ratio (for a wider, more encompassing view in supported games), monitor the TV’s incredibly low input lag, and check to make sure other settings like HDR and VRR are enabled to help get the most from your new console. Samsung supports all the crucial next-gen features, but unfortunately, despite the QN90A’s premium price, the HDMI situation isn’t as good as I’d like: only one of this TV’s four HDMI ports is HDMI 2.1. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/tv-reviews/samsung-qn90a-neo-qled-4k-hdr-tv-review/"&gt;reviews paint the QN90A&lt;/a&gt; as one of (if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) best LCD TVs on the market today. So if you’ll be gaming in a bright room and have the cash, it’s still a top recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="nRb9vy"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRdksmurtkGIFudd6F-n7wHydZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464910/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_11.42.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want excellent OLED picture quality for less than LG, Vizio offers the best cheap OLED gaming TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TEjc5v"&gt;4. Vizio OLED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QNTsw6"&gt;A cheaper OLED gaming TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m7h5BK"&gt;Vizio’s first OLED TV has needed some firmware updates to resolve bugs and get to where it should be in terms of performance, but the company has done a good job of keeping at it in the months since the TV shipped last year. It’s now a fully capable next-gen gaming set with several HDMI 2.1 ports and all the key features (120Hz, VRR) checked off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WbNdEv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bA8ssG"&gt;Its input lag is a bit higher than LG’s, but not enough to become a problem unless you’re the ultra-competitive gamer type — especially when you consider how much less expensive Vizio’s OLED is compared to those from Sony or LG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eOR6W7"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEXn_PVqUavOSR-ibiai7xqqWHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464931/TCL.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 6-Series TV offers a nice mix of next-gen gaming features at an attractive price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oCzSSZ"&gt;5. TCL 6-Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gk3TLQ"&gt;The best budget gaming TV for the Xbox Series X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="p9b52x"&gt;TCL’s 6-Series is the most affordable TV among our recommendations, but that comes with a trade-off: though this is a 4K TV, it doesn’t support 4K gaming at 120Hz. Instead, that fluidity tops out at a resolution of 1440p. (The Xbox consoles can take advantage of this resolution, but the PS5 currently cannot and falls back to 1080p for 120Hz gaming.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N80sV7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ousNRu"&gt;If you can live without 4K at 120Hz — and remember that many games reduce resolution to even hit 120 frames per second — you’re getting a terrific 4K HDR LCD TV with impressive local dimming, Roku’s intuitive software built in, and a price significantly lower than any of our other top picks for next-gen gaming TVs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s miniplayer for Facebook launches today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-Z3dM5JzR2DtIRSyYKmQS5Apvg=/319x0:1420x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69186325/Boombox_banner_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s miniplayer will allow people to stream music and podcasts from their Facebook News Feed. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PTzO1j"&gt;Facebook is making it easier to never leave its app. The company’s partnership with Spotify is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-26/share-explore-and-discover-music-and-podcasts-via-spotify-in-the-facebook-app/"&gt;coming to fruition today&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a miniplayer for the News Feed that’ll allow people to play music and podcasts from within Facebook. Audio content can be shared from Spotify to Facebook, and once on Facebook, listeners can press play and listen to it even as they scroll around. It’ll be available on both iOS and Android and in 27 markets, including the US, at first. More will follow in the coming months. Users will also see the miniplayer on shared videos that have music in the background. A play button will surface after the video finishes where people can play the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS3Sf8"&gt;Facebook listeners will hear the shared track, and once it ends, Spotify will continue to play music on shuffle, as it usually does. Free users will hear ads, too. The ads will come directly from Spotify, but Facebook will receive “limited data” about users trying the integration, including subscription type and metrics to assess the miniplayer’s performance. It won’t use this information to target ads, Spotify says, and listeners will have to consent to the data sharing when they first start the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UoZoe"&gt;This partnership comes along with a larger audio push from Facebook. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391551/facebook-audio-podcasts-clubhouse-competitor-spotify-live-rooms"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; multiple new features last week, including its Clubhouse competitor Live Audio Rooms as well as shareable, short sound clips called Soundbites. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also emphasized an interest in podcasts, and this partnership is one way people will be able to listen to shows without sacrificing any Facebook time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom’s Immersive View could make video calls feel a bit more in-person</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q8Bvsf"&gt;Zoom is rolling out a video background feature called Immersive View that could make video calls feel a bit more like an office meeting — or at least look a lot more like one. Zoom announced the feature last year at its &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/ucaas-platform-whats-new-for-meetings-phone-webinar-zoomtopia-2020/"&gt;Zoomtopia conference&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s actually available for Free and Pro accounts attending meetings and webinars with up to 25 participants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X50q5s"&gt;Immersive View builds on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173608/zoom-video-conference-how-to-virtual-background-greenscreen"&gt;virtual background features&lt;/a&gt; Zoom already has, but focuses on actually placing meeting attendees &lt;strong&gt;in&lt;/strong&gt; a realistic-looking location, rather than just switching out a flat background. Meeting hosts can enable Immersive View from the same menu where you can find Speaker View and Gallery View; from there, Zoom will automatically place attendees in a variety of built-in virtual scenes like a board room or auditorium, or the meeting host can manually place them themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HWPGjvTvRUr_zzw-JE3nJf98rA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466146/Screen_Shot_2021_04_23_at_4.11.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom includes some more out-there options for Immersive View backgrounds, including an art gallery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="18eQ9U"&gt;Zoom says hosts can also resize attendees, move them around the scene, and upload their own scenes if they get bored of Zoom’s options. Theoretically any image could be used as an Immersive View background, but Zoom says matching the &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503#h_01ED77TMFJXBJGY9KKJBC916FK"&gt;file type, aspect ratio, and resolution recommendations&lt;/a&gt; it has for virtual backgrounds will produce the best results. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXkCnrTLI2SrpGJZ_EDX5ZHgO5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466306/classroom_immersive.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom originally introduced Immersive View with an example featuring students in a virtual classroom scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w3c4lg"&gt;Immersive View also features some notable limitations. For calls larger than 25 people, the remaining participants will hangout in a strip of video thumbnails at the top of the scene.  Also, for anyone not running the latest version of Zoom on desktop or mobile, the background will default to whatever setting it was on before Immersive View was turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdwXio"&gt;So if you’re not using an updated Zoom client, your friends could be meeting in an art gallery, but all you’d see is the usual grid of boxes, with black backgrounds behind the other attendees. Recordings of Immersive View meetings run into a similar issue; they’ll be recorded in Zoom’s standard Speaker or Gallery View, rather than a fun virtual scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4noeqp"&gt;Zoom became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207053/zoom-video-conferencing-security-privacy-risk-popularity"&gt;the go-to video call service&lt;/a&gt; of the pandemic, but both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189010/skype-together-mode-microsoft-teams-feature"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; beat it to background options like Immersive View. Microsoft updated both Teams and Skype with a feature called Together Mode in 2020 that places meeting attendees in the same virtual scene together, using computer vision to cut out faces and shoulders for easier placement in a virtual scene.&lt;/p&gt;
