    <title>Judge orders Facebook to hand over Myanmar officials’ hate posts for genocide case</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hdlhGq"&gt;A District of Columbia judge &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.218820/gov.uscourts.dcd.218820.22.0_1.pdf"&gt;ordered Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to let the Gambia government access deleted posts where Myanmar officials promoted hate against the Rohingya people. The order comes &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-facebook/facebook-rejects-request-to-release-myanmar-officials-data-for-genocide-case-idUSKCN2521PI"&gt;more than a year&lt;/a&gt; after Facebook rejected a request for the data — which Gambia seeks to use in a genocide case before the International Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMWAYx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;Facebook has acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that Myanmar’s military used its app — the country’s &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; portal to the internet — to portray the Rohingya Muslim minority as a terrorist group. Their now-deleted posts encouraged mass murder, displacement, and other human rights abuses. Facebook has provided information separately to the United Nations Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, but it called Gambian prosecutors’ requests “extraordinarily broad” and invasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xcj5hA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Myanmar officials intended their reach to be public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lLOj3R"&gt;Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui found that the relevant Facebook posts weren’t meant as private communications that might get extra legal protection. “Although some of the pages were nominally private, the Myanmar officials intended their reach to be public, and in fact they reached an audience of nearly 12 million followers,” the order says. “Making their accounts and pages private would have defeated their goal of inflaming hate in the widest possible audience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yktvyq"&gt;The order doesn’t criticize Facebook for deleting the content from public view, but it says Facebook hasn’t shown that handing over private backups of it now would be burdensome or violate the users’ privacy. “Facebook taking up the mantle of privacy rights is rich with irony. News sites have entire sections dedicated to Facebook’s sordid history of privacy scandals,” Faruqui wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UA5fyz"&gt;Facebook must also produce any non-legally privileged records from its investigation into the role Facebook played in the genocide. The records could help prosecutors understand how Facebook connected “seemingly unrelated” accounts to Myanmar government officials, including which accounts were operated out of the same locations. The judge rejected Gambia’s request for a deposition where Facebook would explain the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maO1jp"&gt;Judge Faruqui said in the order that he “came to praise Facebook, not to bury it.” But he criticized the company for failing to cooperate with the Gambian government. “Facebook can act now. It took the first step by deleting the content that fueled a genocide. Yet it has stumbled at the next step, sharing that content,” he wrote. “Failing to do so here would compound the tragedy that has befallen the Rohingya.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consumer Reports isn’t impressed by Tesla’s reinvention of the (steering) wheel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqkNmn44Uzxwfj9piIW7cdbQ_yA=/0x0:1201x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898054/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s84wY3"&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681470/teslas-consumer-reports-autopilot"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;, the recommendations and ratings &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; assigns to Tesla vehicles have yo-yoed between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234740/consumer-reports-tesla-model-3-recommend-remove"&gt;unacceptable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555745/consumer-reports-tesla-vision-model-3-top-pick-iihs"&gt;incredible&lt;/a&gt;, usually due to the electric car maker’s unorthodox design and packaging decisions. When Tesla revealed its redesign of the Model S and Model X interiors this spring, future unpleasantness loomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGij1l"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; lauds consistency and stability, especially for safety and usability, Tesla’s designers ditched the steering wheel and gear selector that drivers are familiar with. Now, drivers steer with a yoke that resembles what you’d find in a race car, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256504/teslas-model-s-x-redesign-automatic-shifting-prnd-gears"&gt;the car itself can make decisions about going forward or backward&lt;/a&gt; when you press the gas pedal unless the driver specifically selects a gear on its touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KE8AXS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Elon: “Yet another round wheel is boring &amp;amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LecgY9"&gt;Ahead of more in-depth reviews based on multiple months of testing, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars-driving/tesla-steering-yoke-little-benefit-potential-safety-pitfalls-a1034204120/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; dedicated an article to just the yoke&lt;/a&gt; and found that it’s not all bad. Its design does give a better view of the sedan’s gauge cluster, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1435917094751768582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1435917094751768582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.consumerreports.org%2Fcars-driving%2Ftesla-steering-yoke-little-benefit-potential-safety-pitfalls-a1034204120%2F"&gt;Elon Musk promised&lt;/a&gt;. However, that might not be worth giving up the existence of something to grab if the driver loses their grip while taking a turn at high speeds and a decided lack of padding to ease pressure during long drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l0fcz"&gt;The sharper criticism is reserved for the other element Tesla removed from its cars — the turn signal stalk. One driver said it “actually bothers me even more than the steering wheel,” with all the functionality — lights, window washers, etc. — shifted to touch-sensitive buttons mounted on the yoke itself. That means they change position as it turns and can be hard to interpret without the physical feedback of a button. The yoke can vibrate once or twice to indicate which mode you’re in, but on bumpy roads, like the ones we have here in Michigan, that might be hard to distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0tBNr"&gt;What Tesla buyers are willing to live with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/repkord/status/1440908464625106946"&gt;to experience life on the bleeding edge&lt;/a&gt; should more than cover any awkward grips while steering, but reading these first impressions can help you understand whether different is better in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Halo-themed Xbox Series X and PS5 will be available through Walmart today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t6etFJjv5JSjBEKdsBpJGRqCC-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69898014/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vBOobq"&gt;Walmart is hosting a big console restock event today, September 23rd, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT.  It’s going to have the PS5 consoles, along with the standard Xbox Series X and the limited edition &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;-themed Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbMpfd"&gt;In case you’re after that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed console, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Halo-Infinite-Limited-Edition-Bundle%2F288604110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll be able to try your luck at getting one through this link&lt;/a&gt;. Spec-wise, it’s no different than the standard model, but it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"&gt;a more alluring design&lt;/a&gt;, both on the console and the included wireless controller. Two things to note: it’s $549.99, costing $50 more than the regular Series X. Another thing is that you won’t receive this until the game launches on November 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6F44Hm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10718933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mfv5Ml"&gt;Or, you can try to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F141335186&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get the $499.99 Xbox Series X console&lt;/a&gt;, which has a Blu-ray disc drive, around 800GB of useable (but expandable) storage, and includes a wireless controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1LmOSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="HhIaF6"&gt;For people who are eager to get a PlayStation 5, Walmart has both editions of the console available today. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F994712501&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You’ll be able to get the $499.99 version&lt;/a&gt; that has a built-in Blu-ray disc drive and a DualSense controller. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F979738052&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s also going to sell the digital version&lt;/a&gt; that lacks a disc drive for $399.99. Both consoles have around 660GB of useable storage, but they’re expandable via their NVMe M.2 slot. If you just plan on playing PS4 games, you can use a cheaper external USB hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 stacks up to the Surface Laptop Studio, Go 3, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhR6nf3Uxt3jsIG5S2vARwFZi5g=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897980/Surface_Pro_X___Modes_under_embargo_until_September_22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i0aKwb"&gt;At its recent hardware event, Microsoft refreshed almost its entire lineup of Surface products (sorry, Surface Book, but you’re sitting this one out). The company showed off the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Go 3&lt;/a&gt;, and it capped off the proceedings with details about its interesting and transforming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686706/microsoft-surface-studio-laptop-design-specs-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;. There was more at the event, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679573/microsoft-surface-pro-x-display-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Wi-Fi version of the Pro X&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-design-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; folding phone. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;Here are all of the biggest announcements&lt;/a&gt; if you wanted to see them in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="belu8g"&gt;If you’re trying to figure out which of these new Windows 11-equipped machines you should buy, knowing their specs might help you make a decision. But given that they’re different sizes and marketed to different kinds of people, professions, and hobbies, this isn’t exactly a level playing field. And we won’t know exactly how they perform until we review, which will likely happen sometime in October. To give you a little more context, we’ve added the Surface Laptop 4 into the table below since it’s a relatively new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IICn8"&gt;Until then, here are all of the specs that matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6UV4Dx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder all of the new Surface hardware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683783/microsoft-surface-pro-x-8-3-go-laptop-studio-preorder-price-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="kNXo4A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10767940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Je9jOC"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UvHc0a"&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wtf9WL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/tiger-king-2-leads-pack-of-upcoming-documentaries-exploring-crimes-cons-and"&gt;Netflix has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202720/tiger-king-documentary-review-netflix-joe-exotic"&gt;hit documentary &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be returning for a second season later in 2021, following the success of the first season — which hit streaming just as the COVID-19 pandemic began and is indelibly associated with the early days of COVID lockdown culture, a mix of heady escapism at a time when leaving home seemed impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="knuuH6"&gt;
&lt;p id="eqdEsY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s March 2020. Everyone is stuck at home due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bored with nowhere to go, no one to see, and nothing to do, you — along with millions of others, boot up Netflix and find a new documentary series called Tiger King, a salacious, practically unbelievable story of the rise and fall of self-made tiger zoo magnate Joe Exotic (and his rivalry with fellow tiger aficionado Carol Baskin). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cBWko"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hit play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gzeFKo"&gt;
&lt;p id="S0dmEC"&gt;There isn’t too much information about the upcoming second season — only that it will bring “just as much mayhem and madness as Season 1,” which seems like a high bar to clear. Netflix hasn’t even announced a hard release date or debuted a trailer yet, either; the announcement came as part of the company’s reveal of its upcoming true crime documentary slate, which also includes &lt;em&gt;The Puppet Master: Hunting the Ultimate Conman, The Tinder Swindler, Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bad Vegan (&lt;/em&gt;all of which are A.) real shows and movies, and B.) all debuting in 2022). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rrNk3m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tiger King is coming back this year — and Season 2 promises just as much mayhem and madness as Season 1! &lt;a href="https://t.co/mFBUxtAl6i"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mFBUxtAl6i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1441039660415795201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="cHgbRz"&gt;
&lt;p id="7YVZoA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s sometime in 2021. Everyone is still stuck at home because of the still raging Delta variant of COVID-19. Bored with nowhere to go, no one to see, and nothing to do, you — along with millions of others, boot up Netflix and watch the newly announced season two of Tiger King, which delves deeper into the strange tale of Joe Exotic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xncVbu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hit play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YLrZ1b"&gt;
&lt;p id="W8O58d"&gt;Given that Exotic himself is currently in federal prison, it’ll be interesting to see what parts of the story Netflix is focusing on in the upcoming second season. That said, with how popular the show was when it first debuted (even if some of that &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/nicolas-cage-joe-exotic-amazon-tiger-king-series-scrapped/"&gt;attention has since waned&lt;/a&gt;), it’s obvious that Netflix would want to try and capture the magic a second time with a sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="geFYe8"&gt;
&lt;p id="ff9bio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s sometime in 202X. Everyone is still stuck at home because of the still raging Omega variant of COVID-19. Bored with nowhere to go, no one to see, and nothing to do, you — along with millions of others, crank up your hand generator and boot up Netflix and watch the newly announced season six of Tiger King, detailing the rise of the Tiger King Joe Exotic, Ruler of the Middle United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vF3hc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You sigh and press play. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RRAINg"&gt;
&lt;p id="vOaV9v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; season 2 will arrive on Netflix later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPadOS 15 ruined my iPad’s homescreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ediFrrEth4WP4a4mUR1Txvld0dw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897795/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDjasA"&gt;There’s a lot of promise and potential in iPadOS 15. Even with some features like SharePlay missing from the initial release, others like Quick Note and a dramatically simpler approach to multitasking already improve the day-to-day experience of using Apple’s tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNeARK"&gt;But Apple sure did manage to bungle the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Us0h3"&gt;As my colleague Chaim mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in his review of iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, the homescreen layout is no longer consistent between vertical and horizontal orientations. I’ve been using the 12.9-inch iPad Pro since 2018, and as of iPadOS 14, the homescreen grid was always 6 x 5 no matter how the iPad was being held. This allowed me to set up dedicated rows for things like photo editing (I edit many of my review photos on the iPad), audio apps, video apps, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Y7qdEYsDxwihGVkkhPjVAB1B28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871871/iPadOS14Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See how icon positioning stayed the same on iPadOS 14? That was nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LvsNsI"&gt;But with iPadOS 15, Apple threw a wrench into all that. When the iPad is in landscape mode, I still get the 6 x 5 layout. But now, as soon as I switch to vertical / portrait, the grid inexplicably changes to 5 x 6, with icons flowing down into the row below them. So much for my attempts at organization and keeping things tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgylnT"&gt;It’s a frustrating change, and it results in a very obvious amount of wasted space at the sides of the screen. The icon spacing in vertical orientation gets almost comical on this large, pixel-rich display if you do drop in some widgets, as you’ll see later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89h7yM"&gt;The best explanation I’ve seen for this reduction in icon density is that it was necessary to support the more flexible widget placement and still keep everything looking somewhat uniform and aesthetically pleasing. It also has to do with how Apple maps out widgets on the homescreen. In his review of iOS and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Federico Viticci surmised that Apple chose to “return to a non-dense grid that allows for both widgets and icons at the same time.” But I’m just not on board. Particularly on iPads, we’re at the point where at least having the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; for a more tightly-packed grid would unlock new promise and creativity. Apple still doesn’t even permit empty gaps between icons or widgets. Instead, the company remains weirdly dedicated to its restrictive, always-from-the-top-left placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYVlXj"&gt;I’m sure there are many fantastic widgets out there at this point, and the new XL size — exclusive to the iPad — does open up more possibilities for calendar widgets and other productivity tools. But personally, I just don’t find myself using them often, and I was perfectly okay with the old style of keeping widgets anchored to the left of the main homescreen, where they could be pulled into view when needed and then easily dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7Bo9TghTSuk_fKEwrSbEuWyUSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871872/iPadOS14widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPadOS 14 only supported widgets in the “today view.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ujVpY6"&gt;But then we move on to iPadOS 15. And my first criticism comes right at the start. For some reason, Apple finds it appropriate to plop several widgets onto your iPad’s homescreen immediately after the update, which will throw whatever ordering you had before into disarray. It looks quite bad. Here’s mine on first boot following the iPadOS 15 upgrade, where in portrait we drop from five columns to four... on a 12.9-inch screen… all for the purpose of showcasing widgets:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pgAcDmSv2KTwqXYcaRkjgbuodA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871875/iPadOS15firstboot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homescreen chaos. What a wonderful introduction to a new software update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zhuJxE"&gt;Yikes. What a ham-fisted way of introducing a new feature to customers. Why not just &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; these more flexible, put-them-where-you-want widgets in a post-update video instead of wrecking actual homescreens? I’d be irked if some macOS update dumped a bunch of random junk onto my desktop, and I’m similarly annoyed by what Apple’s done here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RdruIX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I can’t be the only iPad user to install iPadOS 15 and frown at seeing how its home screen widgets broke up a painstakingly-organized app icon grid.&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Pegoraro (@robpegoraro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robpegoraro/status/1440091473496707072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tRFFgE"&gt;It also illustrates the significant tradeoff that comes with widgets: as soon as you add even one, no matter the size, you’re down to just four columns for that homescreen in portrait mode. On a display as expansive as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, that’s brutal. And again, it’s all because of Apple’s fixation with the grid. This is a problem of the company’s own making. At least you can cram a ton of apps into the dock, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="af2GHX"&gt;With a little rearranging, I was able to get back to where things were before — but only in the landscape orientation. As I mentioned earlier, portrait is now limited to a 5 x 6 grid (even when no widgets are present), and there’s no setting to change this back to the old layout. All that wasted space. And for what? This is even noticeable on smaller iPads; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/T-UhbAcZd3I"&gt;in his review of the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, Marques Brownlee couldn’t help but notice the padding on both sides of the homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYtdK61eQa2zjm3-9dsMUBgOjhM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871888/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_8.58.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-UhbAcZd3I" target="_blank"&gt;MKBHD (YouTube)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the new iPad Mini has wasted homescreen potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9VXBK"&gt;It’s fair to point out that in iPadOS 14, there was wasted screen real estate at the top and bottom of the icon grid when in vertical orientation. But I think it’s far better for familiarity and muscle memory to maintain the same app positioning and layout in both scenarios, so I found that acceptable. This? Not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lYkfB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iPadOS15?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#iPadOS15&lt;/a&gt; widget and icon placement is absolute madness, especially when changing orientation &lt;a href="https://t.co/wQrFZ7rXYK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wQrFZ7rXYK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Finnen (@danfinnen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danfinnen/status/1440039844349034499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rz5IAj"&gt;What frustrates me most about the new homescreen is that it’s impossible to make rows for specific purposes, since one icon will always reflow into the next row when you hold the iPad in portrait. Sure, folders exist, but that’s an extra tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIUoB3"&gt;Some have pointed out that iPadOS 15 now allows you to customize totally separate layouts for the homescreen when in portrait and landscape, and it will remember what goes where as you switch between them. So you can create a different look for each orientation. That’s neat! But the initial jumbled mess when changing orientations is jarring, and having separate layouts doesn’t fix the issue of icons jumping around. Currently, you can’t delete an icon or widget from one layout and keep it in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0GIR-UTJDerc9Xq59_BdkVltJdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871876/iPadOS15Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With iPadOS 15, the homescreen is 6 x 5 in landscape and 5 x 6 in portrait. (Total icons vary by iPad type and screen size.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="38hdG4"&gt;As of the new update, Apple has also ditched the convenient landscape “today view” that displayed the date and time with widgets underneath — all while keeping your apps in easy reach. Your choices now are to put widgets directly on the homescreen or, if you prefer to keep them off, you can swipe right for this blurred slide-over version, which is &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;, but less elegant:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1C_itHJ5DiQ7TDYRbxGyelyOhc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871878/iPadOS15widgets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The nice homescreen today view is gone, but you can still slide in widgets from the left if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5lKba"&gt;Some will see this as a very minor inconvenience and carry on with updating to iPadOS 15 for all of the other benefits. Since the App Library is now there, you can even go in the complete &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; direction and load your homescreens up with widgets everywhere and only a few app icons. If that’s you, don’t let me stop you. On the whole, it’s a very good release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5qRVB"&gt;But I’m really hoping in a future software update, Apple will add a setting to restore the old layout that kept everything more consistent. It’d be even better if the company made the grid more customizable on the whole. If we’re letting people choose between new and old Safari designs, why not offer a choice between having more things on-screen or a less dense grid that’s better optimized for widgets? There’s already a “Home Screen and Dock” section in settings, after all. Letting you adjust the grid to your liking is something that Android phones and tablets already get right. It’s not a huge ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2xBhv"&gt;For me, widgets aren’t worth the homescreen looking different based on how I’m holding my iPad. And I’m not alone, with other iPad owners on &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-15-we-are-stuck-with-6x5-apps-on-home-screen-now.2299988/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadPro/comments/pskv7t/ios_15_only_5_icons_per_row/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere venting about these changes. Some of them have downgraded back to iPadOS 14.8 until there’s a solution. I’ve now done so for the second time (I needed those screenshots) even if I’ll miss Quick Note, the much-improved multitasking, and other refinements of iPadOS 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7OWzt"&gt;I don’t know how long I’ll stay on the older software. Once iPadOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/psplhz/i_dont_want_them_to_fix_this_ipados_15/"&gt;a little more polished&lt;/a&gt; or adds SharePlay back in, I might update. But a familiar homescreen that works the way I expect counts for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqbGbSGmH85GkDjjYs0cJoIf2Gs=/244x0:2545x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897757/Screen_Shot_2017_09_14_at_11.51.30_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OBqCUT"&gt;The European Commission has announced plans to force smartphone and other electronics manufacturers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;fit a common USB-C charging port&lt;/a&gt; on their devices. Given that most Android-powered smartphones now ship with a USB-C port, the proposals could see Apple finally be forced to move to USB-C on the iPhone. Or they might not, as they could instead force Apple to deliver a portless iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSAFOc"&gt;Today’s proposals from the EU only cover wired charging and don’t seek to enforce rules on wireless charging just yet. A spokesperson for the Commission has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that if a device charges only wirelessly, then there is no requirement to integrate a USB-C charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsiayr"&gt;If the European Parliament adopts the proposals, manufacturers will have 24 months to comply with the new rules. That gives Apple a lot of time to create a portless iPhone if it wants to avoid USB-C altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Lightning connector stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgBlGYJBs257ZkkwLiaYzRGZVP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1362261/lightningapple.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Lightning connector has existed for nearly 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYjoXg"&gt;Apple has notoriously avoided USB-C on the iPhone, despite adopting it on many iPad and MacBook models. While the EU says its proposals are driven by environmental incentives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;Apple has argued&lt;/a&gt; that a switch to USB-C would actually be worse for the environment because it renders hundreds of millions of Lightning accessories obsolete. These arguments might be irrelevant if Apple goes portless, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZOLVj"&gt;Rumors of an iPhone without any ports have circulated for years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12838024/apple-iphone-7-plus-headphone-jack-removal-courage"&gt;Apple had the “courage”&lt;/a&gt; to kill off the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and make it clear wireless was the future for headphones. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/5/20997166/apple-iphone-no-ports-2021-oled-rumors-2020-se-kuo-research"&gt;analysts originally predicted&lt;/a&gt; that this year’s iPhone would ship without any ports, ditching the Lightning port in favor of wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojIaWa"&gt;That clearly hasn’t happened with the iPhone 13, but it doesn’t mean it’s not far off. The world of wireless charging is increasingly complicated, and interoperability isn’t always guaranteed, but things are moving quickly. The OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging, meaning the phone will fully charge in 43 minutes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;Xiaomi also announced&lt;/a&gt; its next salvo in the wireless charging wars last year, thanks to an 80W wireless charger. Xiaomi claims it can charge a 4,000mAh battery fully in just 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LOzlCNU7jLmQ2z3t-6SttSCcSNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9241503/airpower.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirPower didn’t work out for Apple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U7SEIJ"&gt;Apple’s experiences with wireless charging haven’t been as impressive, though. Apple’s AirPower wireless charger was supposed to arrive with the unique ability to charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/29/18287383/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-cancelled"&gt;Apple canceled AirPower in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, citing difficulties in bringing the product to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJaFRk"&gt;The new iPhone 13 Pro supports wireless charging over the Qi standard at up to 7.5 watts and up to 15 watts using MagSafe wireless charging. Both of these are still slower than the fast-charge capable cables you can use to charge an iPhone with. Like anything Apple, the company is probably prototyping better wireless charging methods that will follow years after the Android competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJpOT8"&gt;Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that Apple has no plans to ditch the Lightning port on the iPhone in “the foreseeable future” and could move straight to a portless iPhone that relies exclusively on its MagSafe wireless charging standard instead. “If the ‌iPhone‌ abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt a portless design with ‌MagSafe‌ support instead of using a USB-C port,“ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;said Kuo earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro ships with a Lightning port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gGULFs"&gt;Such a move could be driven by Apple’s desire to protect its MFi licensing business instead of moving to USB-C. Apple makes money off of every Lightning cable and accessory sold by way of licensing fees from the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/"&gt;MFi accessory program&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also controls the MagSafe standard through its MFi program, ensuring it captures licensing fees on some wireless charging accessories for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHV8aM"&gt;If Apple is able to move to a portless iPhone before the two-year grace period from the European Commission, it could still be on a collision course for future clashes over charging standards, though. While the EU admits wireless charging is “not seen as a replacement for wired charging at the moment because of the efficiency rates of such chargers,” it does leave the door open to look at this technology at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1G4PP"&gt;“It is also necessary to provide the basis for adaption to any future technological progress by introducing a harmonization of the charging interfaces and the charging communication protocols with respect to radio equipment that may be charged via any means other than wired charging, including charging via radio waves (wireless charging),” says the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATH9yl"&gt;If Apple continues to support the Qi wireless charging standard, then it could avoid further scrutiny if it does move to a portless iPhone in the future. But if MagSafe comes to dominate, we could be back in an EU battle over charging standards once again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jake Gyllenhaal on the challenges of acting over Zoom in Netflix’s thriller The Guilty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="the guilty" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wtb68jNLwqHj_j2kDIKQTQSplxI=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897659/Guilty_20201120_2367_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Glen Wilson / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x293Ad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; was always going to be a challenging project. The movie, which is a remake of a Danish film from 2018, follows a 911 dispatcher in Los Angeles, who receives a troubling call that appears to be from a woman who has been abducted. The result is a tense thriller, but one you see almost none of — the entire movie is centered on LAPD officer Joe Baylor, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he fields phone calls in an office over the course of a single evening. Because of this, the movie hinges on Gyllenhaal’s performance, as he slowly unravels while the story twists and turns in disturbing ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq0Hlw"&gt;But it became even more challenging thanks to pandemic-related restrictions on filming. While the actors were on set, director Antoine Fuqua, who previously worked with Gyllenhaal on the boxing drama &lt;em&gt;Southpaw&lt;/em&gt;, was in a van a block away, directing remotely. Meanwhile, everyone on the other end of the phone — which includes the likes of Peter Sarsgaard and Ethan Hawke — was working from home. Production on &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; ended up relying on a mishmash of various forms of communication, from FaceTime to Zoom to plain old walkie-talkies. “We had to discover, and were constantly trying to learn as we went,” Gyllenhaal tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think we got a system down on day 11 — and then we were done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="32b1z1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaB_ERMAZu4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sXmCaz"&gt;The filming setup was complicated. Because someone close to Fuqua tested positive, he was forced to sit in a van that was hardwired to the set and outfitted with all of the gadgets he’d need to direct. “I had monitors and computers and walkie-talkies and spycams,” he says. From here he had a bird’s-eye view of the set and was able to talk to his first assistant director and other staff via a walkie. Meanwhile, all of the actors who were calling in remotely would be on Zoom in the background so they could hear everything going on and communicate in real time. In moments where more personal or intimate notes were required, Fuqua and Gyllenhaal would hop on FaceTime to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T4Nsn"&gt;The closest the actor and director ever got to face-to-face communication was, well, a little unorthodox. “When we were in a setup change — a lighting change that would take more than 20 minutes or something — I’d go outside and I’d climb this ladder that was on the wall, and Antoine would open the door to his van, and like Romeo and Juliet we would talk from afar; me on the top of this wall on a ladder and him on the street,” says Gyllenhaal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2mZoDZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It leaves less room for something feeling alive.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGKt0w"&gt;Beyond the logistical challenges, all of these different ways of communicating — in particular Zoom — had an impact on the actual performances. “We were a slave to a particular technology, which was Zoom,” Gyllenhaal explains. “And that creates a rhythm. Even in our introductions, we would come on, and you don’t want to interrupt someone. That’s the essence of acting: rhythm. When your rhythm is dictated to you by a technological thing, it leaves less room for something feeling alive. And we had to navigate that for the first four or five days. It was like someone took a quarter of a second out of my instinct. And if you’re a professional at whatever you do, acting in particular, rhythm is everything. Ask a quarterback, you take a quarter of a second away from their throw, that means the difference between missing or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuJWDB"&gt;Midway through &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a seemingly minor location change, when Gyllenhaal’s character moves from a busy office full of other dispatchers to an empty room across the hall so he could be alone. From the viewer’s perspective, the change doesn’t seem like a big deal. It’s just a man walking from one desk to another. But given all of the restrictions on set, the shift in location made a huge difference for the actors and production team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sXg3lR7b0jZpROlkxAr0SmZcapU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870501/Guilty_20201121_2642_R.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N7uLvb"&gt;“We were all racing towards that small room,” says Gyllenhaal. “We were all desperate to get the character in that small room where he was alone because it meant we could move away from having everyone together in a big room with extras moving about. It was almost like, can we get through the first two days safe, and then we don’t have everyone interacting as much. We have people in the background through glass walls. I remember that very specifically. Let’s get through those first two days and we can feel a little safer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnmlda"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Let’s get through those first two days and we can feel a little safer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sh1DR3"&gt;(One of the few silver linings was that it was relatively easy to get other actors on board. “Everyone was at home and everyone wanted to work,” says Gyllenhaal. “So we made all of these phone calls and got incredible actors.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSc0FR"&gt;For the most part, these COVID-related challenges aren’t noticeable in the final product, aside from the fact that no one ever seems to get close to each other, even in such close quarters. &lt;em&gt;The Guilty&lt;/em&gt; is incredibly tense despite the fact that you’re mostly just watching a man talk on the phone. Part of that has to do with the story, which goes in all sorts of wild, often uncomfortable, directions. But it also comes down to Gyllenhaal’s performance. For him, one of the biggest obstacles in this role was something that a lot of us have had to deal with during the pandemic. “I did have a hard time sitting still,” he says. “It’s hard to create intensity, to generate energy, after 10 hours of sitting in a chair listening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXkRME"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Guilty &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is coming to select theaters on September 24th and will stream on Netflix on October 1st.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I wish Microsoft made an Xbox or Surface gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRiPlDNiiZYsygMeB2MxrPFk2zo=/0x96:2276x1613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897565/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Gaming.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOIk3U"&gt;I’ve been waiting years for Microsoft to make a gaming laptop, and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt; still misses the mark. Whether it would be an Xbox laptop or a Surface one, Microsoft has never really come close to building something truly designed for gaming on the go. The Surface Book, Surface Pro, and Surface Laptop all serve different creator types, but none really cater to gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpvPgR"&gt;It feels like a missed opportunity, particularly when Microsoft calls Windows 11 “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fKjd_pmQpQM"&gt;the best Windows ever for gaming&lt;/a&gt;,” and the market for gaming laptops has become increasingly lucrative in recent years. Barely a month goes by without a thin and cool gaming laptop being announced, and the line separating laptops from gaming laptops is increasingly blurring thanks to advances in chip designs and cooling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oDlJO"&gt;Microsoft has never marketed the Surface Book as a gaming laptop, but the Surface Laptop Studio comes as close as Microsoft has ever come to embracing PC gaming on a Surface. “Elevate your PC gaming,” says Microsoft on its Surface Laptop Studio product page, adding that the device allows you to “play the latest games with graphics that rival reality.” Microsoft also markets the device with people playing Xbox Game Pass for PC games on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIN7WADgz9-tbwyuXTEFMuR95fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871773/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Gaming_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft markets the Surface Laptop Studio for gaming on the go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUHPni"&gt;I was hoping the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a successor to the Surface Book, might capitalize on the interest in gaming laptops. Unfortunately, Microsoft has picked one of the weakest Nvidia GPUs available right now, the RTX 3050 Ti. It can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price"&gt;deliver 60fps gameplay&lt;/a&gt; in some modern games at 1080p, but it won’t come close to hitting the 120fps needed to make use of the 120Hz panel without seriously knocking game settings down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2HTpn"&gt;I wish Microsoft had gone a step further and added options for an RTX 3070 or RTX 3080. The Surface Laptop Studio supports up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB SSD storage, and it ships with Intel’s 11th Gen Core H processors, so it’s more than capable of gaming with the right GPU. It even has Thunderbolt 4 support, so you could buy an eGPU and attach it for gaming, but you shouldn’t really &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to do that to get the best performance on the go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peomlg"&gt;Microsoft has come close to putting a good GPU inside the Surface Book for years, but the company has always shied away from going full gaming laptop. First there was the Surface Book with its GeForce 940M, then the Surface Book with a Performance Base that upgraded the GPU to a GeForce 965M. Neither were suitable for gaming, but the Surface Book 2 delivered a GTX 1060 on the 15-inch version, which was capable of running a variety of games if you were willing to turn the settings down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDRBDtfHNKZep3_AN9z1jaidTzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20003705/twarren_200522_4035_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Book has always come close to embracing PC gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rY7zpM"&gt;The Surface Book 2 was never really designed for gaming, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658466/microsoft-surface-book-2-review"&gt;During my review&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed performance issues due to throttling and problems with the power supply keeping the device fully charged. Microsoft moved to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271735/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-15-inch-screen-size-specs-features-price"&gt;GTX 1660Ti Max-Q on the Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt; and addressed the charging issues, but there were still issues around the dGPU disconnecting randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aR0Md"&gt;Microsoft has always struggled to really embrace the PC gaming platform in general, though. While most people use Windows for PC games, it’s Valve’s Steam that they interact with, not the Microsoft Store or Microsoft’s Xbox apps. Microsoft’s many PC gaming failures (let’s not mention Games for Windows Live) have contributed to a lack of focus, and the company’s UWP experiment for Xbox Game Studios titles has just been a headache for installs, updates, and even during gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl5AFD"&gt;So it’s really no surprise Microsoft is hesitant to embrace the PC gaming with its own hardware, even if it does some great DirectX work in the background to improve PC game performance and underlying APIs for developers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrV0NwZlhNDLFkL4tveBBROKygM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871772/Surface_Laptop_Studio___Internals_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Surface Laptop Studio only has an RTX 3050 Ti inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9t2gwq"&gt;PC gaming is now in a moment of transformation for gaming on the go. There have been a few options for Nintendo Switch-like devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; has thrust the idea into the mainstream. The miniature PC is powered by Linux and, if successful, it could help break the reliance on Windows for PC gaming. Perhaps Microsoft’s even thinking about its own Xbox handheld, as the AMD components Valve is using inside the Steam Deck are also available for competitors to make their own mobile gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa43VO"&gt;Either way, I just wish Microsoft would take PC gaming more seriously both within Windows and with its Xbox / Surface hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;Gaming laptops are no longer bulky and garish&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d love to see what Microsoft could produce if it truly focused on PC gaming on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is betting big on a world’s worth of children’s stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WypbZ2HwPJBsvw6RjDK0sl_cfhs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69897452/RD_NETFLIX_LH_V009__0_00_07_21_20181127_5885_fizs41.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LrIJ0B"&gt;Streaming’s reigning king announced one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686472/netflix-rumor-roald-dahl-willy-wonka-bfg-matilda"&gt;biggest title acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; to date this week with its purchase of the rights to Roald Dahl’s catalog of work. The deal, following regulatory approval, will give Netflix access to a universe of beloved children’s stories to mine and position the company to better compete with kid-friendly competitors like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbBr7z"&gt;The acquisition of the trove of intellectual property follows a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflixs-roald-dahl-deal-could-create-tv-universe-1164419/"&gt;previous partnership&lt;/a&gt; between Netflix and the Roald Dahl Story Company announced in 2018 to adapt some of the late author’s iconic titles. With access to the full library of Dahl stories — which include children’s classics like &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;James and the Giant Peach&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The BFG&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Matilda&lt;/em&gt;, among others — Netflix has the opportunity to build an entire world from the catalog, boosting its originals draw and keeping kids and parents hooked on its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbUpeY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix has previously said it plans to invest in its children’s content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tPOQFz"&gt;The deal is arguably one of the most significant acquisitions Netflix has made in its programming in recent memory, and it speaks to the importance of kids’ content for the service’s continued growth. The company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963816/spongebob-squarepants-spinoff-netflix-nickelodeon-deal-disney-streaming"&gt;huge deal with Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt; for original animated films and series in 2019, a year after the original Dahl partnership was announced, and it recently &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/netflix-orders-3-seasons-cocomelon-lane-animated-preschool-series-specials-little-baby-bum-1234791577/"&gt;ordered three seasons&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;Cocomelon&lt;/em&gt; spinoff, after initially bringing the YouTube-hit kids’ series to its service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJonPn"&gt;Netflix has also pointed toward &lt;em&gt;The Willoughbys&lt;/em&gt;, a 2020 animated comedy the service said reached nearly 38 million households in its first four weeks, as “an example of the level of animated feature film we are ramping towards to bolster our offering for kids and families.” With Dahl’s library, Netflix may very well be making its biggest bet yet in furthering that goal. (Netflix didn’t specify how much it paid for the catalog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MixeQu"&gt;Netflix is competing in a space that’s becoming more crowded by the day. Its obvious primary competitor for children’s streaming, Disney Plus, zoomed past the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;100 million subscriptions mark&lt;/a&gt; by first quarter of 2021. Meanwhile, HBO Max (which has the DC catalog under its umbrella, among other properties) and Apple TV Plus (which has &lt;em&gt;Peanuts &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent properties) have also focused their sights on children’s programming. That’s to say nothing of the series and films for kids available as free-to-stream titles on other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jigJU7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix will develop “a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tho4Fa"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-acquires-iconic-roald-dahl-story-company"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; about this week’s acquisition, Netflix said its existing partnership with the Dahl organization “opened our eyes to a much more ambitious venture — the creation of a unique universe across animated and live action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koNnRj"&gt;The “more” in Netflix’s statement certainly speaks to the company’s indication that it’s interested in continuing to build out franchises and fan communities, most recently with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;big bet on gaming&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other streamers that have primarily focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22458734/amazon-mgm-8-billion-prime-video-streaming"&gt;acquiring legacy studios&lt;/a&gt; for mountains of money as a means of swooping up valuable IP, Netflix has been far more conservative about its investments — underscoring how valuable Netflix sees the Dahl IP as being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXRJUT"&gt;“The industry has consolidated materially over the years […] and we don’t believe this consolidation has affected our growth much, if at all,” the company wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587048/netflix-mobile-games-streaming-wars"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; mere months ago in July. “While we are continually evaluating opportunities, we don’t view any assets as ‘must-have’ and we haven’t yet found any large scale ones to be sufficiently compelling to act upon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wH6DjU"&gt;There’s no doubt that Netflix cut a very sizable check for Dahl’s books, with which Netflix may even be able to expand beyond children’s stories if reimagined for older audiences. But even as Netflix sidesteps the studio bidding wars, it’s proven that it is willing to pay handsomely when the opportunity — in this case, a world’s worth of children’s stories — is right.&lt;/p&gt;
