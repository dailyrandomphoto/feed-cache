    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 review: a ThinkPad with a twist</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A business laptop with an extreme screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="U50owR"&gt;The ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 is a ThinkPad through and through. It’s got the keyboard nub, the discrete mouse buttons, and the all-black chassis with scattered dots of red. (If you’ve seen its predecessor, the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2, you’ll know what you’re getting — the models are identical, with different chips.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OMES8"&gt;But this ThinkPad has a unique feature you don’t see every day: an OLED screen. That, combined with its discrete GPU, puts the X1 Extreme Gen 3 out of the business laptop space that ThinkPads traditionally dominate and into the crowded market for ultraportable content-creation machines. Among those competitors, the X1 Extreme has some significant drawbacks that keep it from reaching the top of the pack. But it still includes the features that have made ThinkPads so dominant across the board, and that means there’s certainly an audience for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngyRwq"&gt;Like other ThinkPads, the X1 Extreme is customizable for a variety of price points. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-3%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1E3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22351156%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;All configurations&lt;/a&gt; have an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q. The base model is $2,734 (currently discounted to a much more reasonable $1,640) and includes a Core i5-10400H, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a 1920 x 1080 non-touch display, and a standard 720p HD webcam. Among prebuilt models, you can go all the way up to a system with a Core i9-10885H, 64GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, a 3840 x 2160 OLED touchscreen, and an IR camera, all for — wait for it — $4,959 (currently listed at $2,974.40). My test configuration is in the middle; it includes a Core i7-10850H, 1TB of storage, 32GB of RAM, and the OLED touchscreen. It has an MSRP of $4,111 but is currently listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-3%2Fp%2F20TKCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22351156%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,466&lt;/a&gt;. You can tweak most of the specs to your liking, though some are dependent on others; for example, all models that don’t have the base display come with the IR camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LheQl6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10412807"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iHbX8Z"&gt;This model has two absolutely standout features. The first is the keyboard. ThinkPads usually have great keyboards, and this one is no exception. It’s one of my favorite keyboards that I’ve tried on a workstation laptop this year, with the possible exception of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt;. The keys have a comfortable texture and a heck of a lot of travel, without being too loud. The typing experience feels closer to that of a mechanical keyboard than to that of flatter laptop keys. I actually found myself eschewing my personal laptop during my testing period in favor of the ThinkPad because of how much I love typing on it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y87H04"&gt;There’s a row of useful hotkeys on the top of the deck. New to the X1 Extreme are three buttons tailored to remote work: F9 brings up the notification center, F10 answers calls, and F11 ends calls. There are also keys to cut the volume and microphone, toggle airplane mode, and adjust volume and brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wnYjjQjbDSScsYPLd8SrV8Qz0mU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395210/mchin_20190614_4484_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports include two USB 3.2 Gen 1, two Thunderbolt 3, one HDMI 2.0, one SD slot, one combo audio jack, and an optional Nano-SIM card slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OBqHDr"&gt;One quick thing about the keyboard: the Fn and Ctrl keys are swapped from the locations where you’ll find them on most keyboards. This is how ThinkPad keyboards have been laid out since forever, and you can remap the keys through the BIOS or with Lenovo’s utility app if you prefer. But if you’re not a regular ThinkPad user, or you’ll be swapping between this machine and a personal laptop, it’s worth noting that it’ll take time to adjust (or you’ll be using mislabeled keys). I’ve been using the X1 Extreme for almost a week, and I’m still accidentally hitting Fn all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFD8dq"&gt;The second standout feature is the 15.6-inch 4K OLED panel. It covers 100 percent of the sRGB spectrum, 100 percent of Adobe RGB, and 100 percent of P3. (Basically, it maxed out our colorimeter.) The panel is sharp and vibrant with great contrast. You can watch streaming content that supports HDR and swap between various color profiles with Lenovo’s Display Optimizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcSXVr"&gt;Build quality is another strength. Like most of its ThinkPad siblings, the X1 Extreme feels quite durable. There’s no flex in the keyboard or lid, and Lenovo says it’s been tested against “12 military-grade certification methods and over 20 procedures” for resistance to vibrations, shocks, extreme temperatures, humidity, and the like. The laptop achieves this without sacrificing much portability. It’s on the thick side at 0.74 inches — but at four pounds, it’s lighter than many competitors including the Dell XPS 15 and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 angled slightly to the right, open. The screen displays an outdoor nighttime scene with the Lenovo logo on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXDIGoXf3RedDTim02P3NoPSc-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395211/mchin_20190614_4484_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo says the multi-layered carbon fiber top cover “provides durability and weight advantages.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q088LS"&gt;The chassis has a black finish with a nice texture. The ThinkPad logo on the right palm rest and the X1 logo on the top cover add splashes of red. The lid has a unique carbon-fiber weave pattern, which looks and feels similar to the carbon-fiber palm rests on the Dell XPS 15. (This is only available on UHD models). Lenovo says this material is lighter and more durable than aluminum and other common chassis materials. It’s also likely part of the reason for the X1 Extreme’s lofty price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 angled to the left, open. The screen displays a nighttime outdoor scene with the Lenovo logo on the right side. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X0ZNpB3vWvxdThLDkc1CarEjAms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395209/mchin_20190614_4484_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are dual far-field microphones that work alongside Cortana.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GGfdae"&gt;One note on the build: the lid and chassis aren’t the worst fingerprint magnets I’ve ever seen, but they do pick them up. After a few days of use, the keyboard deck was pretty smudgy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhrsPp"&gt;Finally, the X1 Extreme comes with some helpful features for remote meetings. You can optimize the dual microphones for various settings (including voice recognition, solo calls, and conference calls) in Lenovo’s Vantage software. They didn’t have any trouble picking up my voice. And the stereo speakers are fine, delivering distortion-free audio with percussion and bass that are audible but not exceptional. You can create custom equalizer profiles in the preloaded Dolby Access software, and you can also toggle presets for scenarios like voice, music, movies, and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="c7YyMZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10412819"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fNB0Nw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The webcam was fairly color-accurate and delivered a decent picture in low-light environments&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="acOAQg"&gt;The infrared webcam was also a pleasant surprise — while a bit grainy, it was fairly color-accurate and delivered a decent picture in low-light environments. There’s a physical privacy shutter that’s easy to click back and forth. You can sign into the X1 Extreme with Windows Hello facial recognition, as well as a match-on-sensor fingerprint reader on the side of the keyboard deck, which was quick to set up and didn’t usually have trouble recognizing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nveSkm"&gt;All of this stuff is similar to the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 2 — there’s not much noticeable change. The Gen 3’s upgrades are on the inside. It has a six-core 10th Gen Intel processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q, where &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-2"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt; had a 9th Gen Intel processor and a GeForce GTX 1650 Max-Q. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrilqe"&gt;The Core i7-10850H isn’t the most monstrous processor around, especially compared to AMD’s recent H-series chips. But it does bring the business-specific benefits of Intel’s vPro platform, and it did a fine job with my piles of spreadsheets, emails, Slacking, and other general office work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YC0QAi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10412821"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ofgkp8"&gt;Similarly, the GTX 1650 Ti Max-Q is a midrange graphics card — it’s not what you’d want to use for serious gaming or high-throughput professional video editing. But for amateur creators and other artists, it can certainly lend a hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moEAAO"&gt;My test model scored a 386 on PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which tests its proficiency in real-world Premiere Pro tasks. That’s not a shameful score among top competitors, but it’s not great either. The system comes in under scores we’ve seen from the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=26551"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with the same GPU, and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=20668"&gt;six-core MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which has AMD Radeon Pro 5300M. And, of course, it loses out to creator machines with more powerful Nvidia chips, such as the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16834233375%3FDescription%3Dgigabyte%2520aero%252015%26cm_re%3Dgigabyte_aero%252015-_-34-233-375-_-Product" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower-priced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=29079"&gt;Gigabyte Aero 15&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 3060. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkGqvq"&gt;If you’re going to be doing intense content work, prepare to hear the fans. Even when I was just bouncing around in Chrome, they were audible quite often. On the plus side, they did their job: the laptop’s bottom, keyboard, touchpad, palm rests, and hinge all remained cold. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard and touchpad of the Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Va21heQbbg0100Dy8EB4qAzP0Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395213/mchin_20190614_4484_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo says the ThinkPad can charge up to 80 percent in 60 minutes with its “Rapid Charge” feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk4JEd"&gt;Another compromise you’re making here is battery life. I only averaged four hours and 59 minutes on our battery test, which involved using the ThinkPad for continuous office multitasking on the Battery Saver profile, with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. I ran a trial without using Chrome to see if that would make a difference; it didn’t. And this result actually seems to be a bit on the high side — &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; got an even pithier two hours and 19 minutes on a synthetic streaming benchmark.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlJKr7"&gt;It’s not unexpected that a machine with a 4K screen and a discrete GPU wouldn’t last all day. But I got more juice out of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255234/gigabyte-aero-15-review-creator-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Gigabyte Aero 15&lt;/a&gt;, which has both an OLED display and a heftier graphics card. And if you don’t need the high-resolution screen (which many people won’t), the Dell XPS 15 (which still has an exceptional display) lasted an hour longer with my workflow, while my colleague Dieter Bohn got up to eight hours out of the MacBook Pro. Folks who are interested in the X1 Extreme who would prefer not to have it plugged in all the time should consider an FHD (1080p) model. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 3 open on an outdoor rock slab. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with the Lenovo logo on the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IBMZiohOMt3SrXSbbzv2H3OqB5Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22395208/mchin_20190614_4484_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a ThinkPad through and through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DoCsu4"&gt;Ultimately, the decision between the ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 and other 15-inch thin-and-light workstations really boils down to: do you want a ThinkPad? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdHcWN"&gt;This is to say that the X1 Extreme shares many of the strengths and weaknesses of Windows machines like the XPS 15. Both have dazzling displays, decent chips, sturdy build, boisterous fans, and mediocre battery life. Both have best-in-class keyboards and touchpads, with average webcams and speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkE3dd"&gt;But a ThinkPad and an XPS are still very different machines — and if you’ve used any member of either lineup before, you probably know which one you prefer. They have different looks and different feels. The ThinkPad is slightly lighter and slightly thicker, with more ports and larger bezels. The XPS is a bit more powerful, but the ThinkPad has extra business features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Jzszel"&gt;The XPS, due to its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-15-touch-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9500-laptop%2Fxn9500cto212s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22351156%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lower price&lt;/a&gt;, is a more accessible model for most consumers. And the X1 Extreme’s weaker chips and poor battery life, in particular, are tough pills to swallow at such a high price. But there’s still a market for the X1 Extreme — and if you’re willing to sacrifice a bit of power, a bit of money, and a bit of battery life for the unique advantages of a ThinkPad, you probably fall into it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comic-Con will hold an in-person event in San Diego over Thanksgiving weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="San Diego Comic Con" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPcMUKR9s45obNw9VjdHMlCUSjQ=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69038322/IMG_4309.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8W1k0x"&gt;Comic-Con won’t be hosting its regular in-person annual gathering this summer, as the organization behind the cosplay and fan gathering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events"&gt;cancel the event for the second year in a row&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is now an in-person event on the books for the fall to compliment the limited online versions the organization is hosting in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ya5Fny"&gt;Comic-Con International, the non-profit in charge of running the event and its companion conventions, &lt;a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci"&gt;announced on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to hold a three-day, in-person event in November. It will take place in San Diego, where Comic-Con typically holds its biggest annual summer event at the city’s convention center. Yet it’s not known right now what the size or scope of the event will be. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/comic-con-hold-person-thanksgiving-convention-n1262265"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC N&lt;/em&gt;ews reports&lt;/a&gt; the dates will be November 26th to November 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yERgMx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Comic-Con will have its first in-person event since the start of COVID-19 this November&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3WxUs"&gt;“As the timing and scope of our larger event factored greatly into our decision to postpone, we believe that launching a smaller in-person event at a later time may be a safe alternative. For this reason, we are happy to announce that San Diego Comic Convention is planning to present a three-day in-person convention in San Diego in November,” reads the press release. “At this time, we are still working on specific details as to attendance capacity, badge cost, and related information, and those details will be forthcoming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9blKy"&gt;Comic-Con is among the US’s largest conventions, drawing more than 130,000 people to San Diego and generating hundreds of millions in revenue for the city on top of the tens of millions of dollars it generates for the organization itself. The organization says that if you purchased a ticket to Comic-Con 2020, your rolled over 2021 ticket is valid for the next in-person event in 2022. However, the organization is “working on an option for those wishing to transfer their badge or exhibitor deposits/payments as full or partial payment towards our 2021 November event,” reads the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbHBRu"&gt;Although it has maintained its roots as a cosplay and fan gathering, Comic-Con in recent years has provided a vital marketing function to Hollywood film and TV studios, comic publishers, production companies, and other arms of the entertainment industry. Celebrities often use the show to promote new and ongoing projects and studios use the visibility of the con and the exclusivity of being live in the audience to reveal new trailers and other teases that only later get uploaded to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon faces lawsuit over missed lunch breaks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXWXrzWpFUyGrm0tJpCss4BHoeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69036607/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H9BNCQ"&gt;A lawsuit that claims one of Amazon’s fulfillment centers in California failed to provide required meal breaks for employees has moved to federal court, as attorneys seek class-action status. First filed in San Francisco County Superior Court in February, the case was removed to US District Court California, Northern District on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGd8pF"&gt;Lovenia Scott, a former employee of the Vacaville, California warehouse, alleges that the company didn’t schedule the required 30-minute meal breaks for workers. When they did get their meal breaks, workers were expected to monitor their walkie-talkies in case of any problems on the floor, which sometimes cut into their break time, the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqBO3K"&gt;The matter of paying workers for time they spend waiting for employers while off the clock has come up in other cases as well. The &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-court-workers-fairpay-20141209-story.html"&gt;Supreme Court decided in 2014&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon workers at a Nevada warehouse weren’t entitled to pay for the time they spent waiting to have their bags searched after clocking out but before leaving the building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyK120"&gt;Earlier this month in a separate case, Amazon and an independent contractor it worked with in California were&lt;a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/california-fines-delivery-service-and-amazon-6-4m-for-wage-theft"&gt; fined $6.4 million for wage theft&lt;/a&gt; by the California Labor Commission’s Office. The state investigation in that case found that Green Messengers, the subcontractor for Amazon, underpaid drivers, scheduling them 10-hour days but with a workload that forced drivers to skip meal and rest breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSbXBk"&gt;Due to the way the meal breaks were organized in Vacaville, Scott claims, many workers took their breaks at the same time. Lines would form at the computer system where employees swiped their badges to clock out for their break time, meaning those at the end of the line saw their breaks shortened as they waited their turn. Scott’s lawsuit also says shifts were “chronically understaffed,” which left some employees unable to take short 10-minute rest breaks in order to finish their work on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJzLJm"&gt;In addition, workers were not compensated for using their personal cell phones to perform work tasks, the lawsuit claims. Scott, who worked at the Vacaville warehouse from October 2016 to January 2019, also says Amazon failed to timely pay her final wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZoqTk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"&gt;Amazon has been bickering with US senators&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter the past few days via its @AmazonNews account, questioning— among other things— the accuracy of reports that some of its delivery drivers are so overworked that they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;had to pee in bottles&lt;/a&gt; because they didn’t have time to take restroom breaks. Numerous &lt;a href="https://revealnews.org/article/behind-the-smiles/"&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;support this claim&lt;/a&gt;, however. And Monday is the deadline for workers at Amazon’s plant in Bessemer, Alabama to vote whether to form the first-ever Amazon union in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAoONs"&gt;Amazon did not reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeep plans to install EV charging stations at US off-road trailheads over the next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BbdaD_-lBTK_z8Lv9vrk6QH02ok=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69036020/CN021_007JP9oc73s45m5h4169n1pcevs2dm9.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Stellantis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oikkM3"&gt;Jeep will install EV charging stations at off-road trailheads across the US as part of a partnership with Electrify America, the company &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jeep-brand-creates-jeep-4xe-charging-network-works-with-electrify-america-to-provide-ev-charging-at-off-road-trailheads-throughout-the-united-states-301256830.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. Chargers on the Jeep 4xe Charging Network will either be solar powered or connected to a power grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E51tRv"&gt;The first of the stations will open this spring in Moab, Utah; the Rubicon Trail in Pollock Pines, California; and Big Bear, California. The chargers will have Level 2 (240 volt) charging, which Jeep notes will fully recharge the 17-kWh battery pack in its Wrangler 4xe in about two hours and provide 49 MPGe and 21 miles of electric range. The chargers will be available free to Jeep 4xe owners via a mobile app, and will be compatible with its future EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krRWdH"&gt;Over the next year, additional chargers will be added at Jeep Badge of Honor off-road trails across the US. The announcement comes a few days after Jeep unveiled its concept for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344578/jeep-wrangler-magneto-concept-ev-manual-transmission-stellantis"&gt;all-electric Wrangler, called the Magneto&lt;/a&gt;. Its design is based on the 2020 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, with an electric motor offering up to 273 pound-feet of torque and 285 horsepower, with an 800-volt system spread across four battery packs, &lt;a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22607&amp;amp;mid=1"&gt;according to Jeep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KN0zsp"&gt;Rivian, the Amazon-backed electric vehicle startup, said last week it plans to install 10,000 fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341664/rivian-install-10000-ev-chargers-us-canada-2023"&gt;EV chargers across the US&lt;/a&gt; and Canada by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s Android TV app finally gets bumped from 720p to 1080p, at least on some devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhLBQRCb4UC_7XtBU3141zJKgPo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035675/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5aT0Gn"&gt;Hulu’s Android TV apps can finally stream in 1080p on new Nvidia Shield TV set-top-boxes and Sony Bravia TVs, as spotted by users on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShieldAndroidTV/comments/mcadwb/heads_up_the_hulu_app_has_finally_been_updated_to/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, and written up by &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hulus-android-tv-app-finally-bumps-up-to-1080p-from-720-1846562065"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-tv-hulu-now-supports-1080p-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/25/hulu-android-tv-720p-limit-shield-tv-upgrade/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hApVfk"&gt;Users first noticed the change in the “App &amp;amp; Device Info” page in the Hulu app. After updating, the app lists the new max video resolution as “1920 x 1080”. It’s sort of a sneaky way to make the change. Looking at the update description on the Play Store, there’s no mention of it, so it’s possible something changed on Hulu’s server side as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OQBZggWJwEcu0Hnkaj-dcw0UCok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22401092/Screenshot_20210325_093257.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hulu’s App &amp;amp; Device Info screen that shows the new max resolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dvcnOI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; says it was able to confirm that at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;the Nvidia Shield from 2019&lt;/a&gt; and Bravia TVs received the 1080p bump on March 23rd, but the change hasn’t been reflected in &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality?language=en_US#svod"&gt;Hulu’s support pages&lt;/a&gt;, which were last updated in February. Hulu doesn’t seem to specifically list which devices stream in each resolution (outside of Live TV streaming) on its support site, but it does provide minimum bitrates for each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eNHqEC"&gt;Standard Definition (SD): 1.5 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0q1wNY"&gt;High Definition (HD) 720p: 3 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="szWWv7"&gt;High Definition (HD) 1080p: 6 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OOePMJ"&gt;4K Ultra HD: 16 Mbps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xxBhAg"&gt;For the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt;, which runs a skinned version of Android TV, it’s not clear when 1080p Hulu support was added, or if it launched with it. I was able to check on my own Chromecast’s Hulu app and it does currently support 1080p. We’ve reached out to Hulu to confirm which other Android TV devices might have been affected by this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUMnVl"&gt;4K streaming is even more limited on Hulu. 4K content is primarily limited to Hulu’s original shows and movies, and according to Hulu’s likely out-of-date list, the devices that can actually stream in 4K are the 5th generation Apple TV, the Chromecast Ultra, Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, LG UHD TVs from 2017 onwards, Roku devices, Vizio TVs with SmartCast, and the Xbox One S and X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8M3nbR"&gt;It’s nice that more devices could theoretically stream in a higher resolution, especially for folks who’ve shelled out money for higher resolution displays. I do think it’s worth mentioning, however, that some of the Redditors who first found this change had no idea they’d been streaming in 720p all this time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccines are changing how we interpret COVID-19 numbers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chicago’s United Center Opens As Mass Vaccination Site" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6uPjNm2x60ehyOTy274HS-5gm4=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035499/1306351495.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ShS4kr"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241402/infection-count-coronavirus-cases-survellience-flu-hospital-sewage-data"&gt;never been possible&lt;/a&gt; to know for sure how many people in the United States are sick with COVID-19 at a particular time. Instead, we combine all of the metrics — the percentage of tests run that come back positive, the number of new cases reported each day, people coming to the emergency room sick with COVID-19 symptoms — to get an estimate. It’s like the story of the blind men and the elephant: experts can feel out the different pieces of information to get a sense of what an outbreak looks like, even when they can’t see it directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pT311"&gt;We’ve seen the same elephant emerge over and over again over the past year. First, the percentage of tests that come back positive increases. After a slight lag, hospitalizations start to rise, and then deaths. But this time, there’s a new wrinkle: vaccinations. That’s going to change the pattern and make the COVID-19 trends over the next few weeks and months harder to interpret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HYHC0n"&gt;One of the most important data points to track the virus’s spread has been the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19-like illness at a particular time. It’s a concrete metric. If someone is so sick that they need to be hospitalized, they’re usually in the hospital. Other measures, like the case rate and test positivity rate, are finicky; they fluctuate based on how many people decide to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yR1xMC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If someone is so sick that they need to be hospitalized, they’re usually in the hospital&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz3U2q"&gt;“Hospitalizations are our hard outcome. Everything else is so dependent on testing,” says Melissa McPheeters, co-director of the Center for Improving the Public’s Health through Informatics at Vanderbilt University. That’s why we’ve looked to hospitalization trends to get a sense of the direction of the pandemic, even when case rates wobble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwRBe5"&gt;Now, COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html"&gt;starting to go up again&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. But this time, over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people over the age of 65 in the United States have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. That’s the group that, if they catch the virus, is most likely to be hospitalized or to die. Now they’re vaccinated — and their risk of hospitalization and death is incredibly small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7KXLp"&gt;That could throw our normal data patterns out of whack. Cases could go up because many states are relaxing restrictions while most people still aren’t vaccinated. But the unvaccinated people getting sick may be younger and less likely to be hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Tw2URL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dV9h5J"&gt;Our normal method of visualizing the elephant wouldn’t work anymore. It’s a good problem to have — fewer people in the hospital is a wonderful victory. But when case numbers wobble and testing goes up and down, hospitalizations will no longer be a reliable backstop to clarify what’s happening with the pandemic. “I don’t know that we can get as good of a sample of what’s going on in the community,” McPheeters says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNtvAf"&gt;It might mean that we need to recalibrate the way we monitor the pandemic. Maybe there will be fewer people in the hospital, but we could take a closer look at that group, for example. If lots of people from one area of a city are in the hospital, or people who work in a similar industry, that might be a signal that there is more virus in that particular community — which could help people to determine their risk and show officials where to direct resources. “It’s not just how many people, it’s &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;is ending up in the hospital,” McPheeters says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usKvq1"&gt;For the past year, people have scrutinized COVID-19 metrics to guide decisions on how they should behave — whether to send kids to school, meet up with a few friends, or get groceries delivered. Eventually, as more people get vaccinated, new patterns could start to emerge that might guide that analysis. And when the pandemic starts to fade, we won’t have to scrutinize the COVID-19 numbers quite as closely. But for now, everything is in flux, and we can’t assume that a number means the same thing today as it did in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7JYFa"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not an easy task, and international politics is making it that much harder. (Anthony Regalado / &lt;em&gt;MIT Tech Review&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QTphua"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ANw99x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AstraZeneca’s wild ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday, AstraZeneca announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344191/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-effective-us-study-disease-protection-fda"&gt;its vaccine was 79 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, the government issued an incredibly unusual public rebuke of the company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346135/covid-vaccine-us-astrazeneca-niaid-statement-concerns"&gt;saying those numbers were outdated&lt;/a&gt;. AstraZeneca released new numbers later this week finding that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22346706/covid-vaccine-astrazeneca-data-niaid-effective"&gt;really 76 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Whew.&lt;/em&gt; In the end, it's a pretty good vaccine with a bad communications problem. The FDA committee hearings for this one are going to be interesting. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer and Moderna are both starting their own trials to test how well the vaccines work in younger patients — and whether they are safe.

&lt;h2 id="nBnQhP"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TYGJxe"&gt;There were the two weeks in the summer when all she could smell was phantom smoke. The odor was so strong that she woke up one morning startled, convinced that something in her house was on fire. Sometime later, she was able to smell her boyfriend’s cologne again—but instead of the familiar scent she had always loved, it was a sickening chemical odor. There’s also the hand soap at work, which used to smell generically fruity to her but now smells exactly, and eerily, like Burger King Whoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YMLNUO"&gt;— Sarah Zhang writes about Ruby Martinez’s experience recovering her sense of smell after COVID-19 in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CMSpOg"&gt;As of December 10, my health-care plan had billed me for $536,000. My plan paid for most of it, but I still owe around $150,000. That doesn’t include my bill for the implant. The medical bills lag; it takes months for things to come through. At first, it was stressful for me to look at them, but now it’s a joke. I look at them and think, I don’t know how to pay that. My premium is $750 a month, and my co-workers have been chipping in to cover that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kfzSS7"&gt;— Liza Fisher tells journalist Wudan Yan about the costs of COVID-19 in a story for &lt;em&gt;Intelligencer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qf7Oat"&gt;More than Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzHy5l"&gt;To the more than 505 &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;million people&lt;/a&gt; who have been vaccinated — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krtvPW"&gt;To the more than 125,864,307 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeseHs"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,761,409 people who have died worldwide — 547,756 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3RK5w"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6eCQq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmTnyO"&gt;Netflix announced at Tokyo’s AnimeJapan 2021 Expo Saturday that it will launch 40 new anime titles in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-27/netflix-to-launch-40-new-anime-shows-after-blood-of-zeus-win?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, following the success of its &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/5/21551756/blood-of-zeus-season-1-ending-hades-twist-season-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood of Zeus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynNdCQ"&gt;The new series to be released this year include an adaptation of the Japanese manga &lt;em&gt;Record of Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, set to premiere in June; &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;, about an African samurai in feudal-era Japan which will premiere April 29th; and &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, based on the video game franchise. Netflix previously announced its anime series &lt;em&gt;The Way of the Househusband,&lt;/em&gt; also based on a Japanese manga series&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will debut April 8th. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/asia/netflix-japan-anime-record-of-ragnarok-1234938795/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the number of anime titles coming to Netflix this year is nearly double the number of anime series and movies it released in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Snqtbt"&gt;“We want to be able to pride ourselves as being the top entertainment destination with good quality content,” Taiki Sakurai, Netflix’s chief anime producer, told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “The growth of our business is directly connected to the growth of our anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qZMge"&gt;The worldwide anime market reached $23 billion last year, and is expected to grow to more than $36 billion by 2025, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Sony announced in December it planned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;buy anime video site Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; for nearly $1.2 billion (although that sale has been delayed due to an &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sonys-hopes-of-countering-netflix-in-anime-market-delayed-by-antitrust-probe"&gt;antitrust probe by the US Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;). According to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix said the number of households that streamed its anime offerings last year &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/business/japan-anime.html"&gt;increased by half&lt;/a&gt; from 2019.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook temporarily freezes Venezuela president’s page for spreading coronavirus misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicolas Maduro Announces Launch of Vaccination Campaign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4vS0eScqETbdSYbTVb7WqJUIyzU=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035382/1231221694.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Carolina Cabral/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hhSRSl"&gt;Facebook froze the page of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro for violating its policy against spreading COVID-19 misinformation, the company confirmed Saturday. As first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-venezuela-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-freezes-venezuela-president-maduros-page-over-covid-19-misinformation-idUSKBN2BJ03Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Maduro had promoted a “miracle” remedy that he claimed would cure the coronavirus, but those claims have not been supported by the medical community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CCKbB"&gt;Facebook also removed a video where Maduro touted Carvativir, a homeopathic remedy extracted from thyme. Maduro has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-venezuela-vaccine-maduro/2021/02/08/99ee1200-663a-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html"&gt;praised the solution in the past&lt;/a&gt; as “miracle drops” and a “medical breakthrough.” Doctors in Venezuela have called Maduro’s claims that Carvatavir can treat the coronavirus “dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWbcCU"&gt;This is not the first time Maduro has made false claims about coronavirus treatments on his social media platforms. Last March, Twitter &lt;a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/03/25/twitter-elimino-un-tuit-de-maduro-sobre-un-supuesto-antidoto-contra-el-covid-19/"&gt;removed one of Maduro’s tweets&lt;/a&gt; that endorsed a “brew” that he falsely claimed could “eliminate the infectious genes” of COVID-19. The removal came despite Twitter’s stance &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2019/worldleaders2019.html"&gt;against removing tweets by world leaders&lt;/a&gt; unless the tweets explicitly violated its other rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zx3iAm"&gt;Facebook has tried with mixed success to combat the spread of coronavirus misinformation throughout the pandemic, enacting policies that required posts that could lead to “imminent physical harm” to be removed. It &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/12/coronavirus/#misinformation-update"&gt;expanded the policy&lt;/a&gt; to require the removal of false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, including conspiracy theories and false statements about the vaccines’ safety and side effects. It also applied labels to posts with incorrect coronavirus information, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/17/21223742/coronavirus-misinformation-facebook-who-news-feed-message-avaaz-report"&gt;guided users to accurate information&lt;/a&gt; from reliable medical sources.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJnItG"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that the company follows guidance from the World Health Organization which says there is no cure for the coronavirus. “Due to repeated violations of our rules, we are also freezing the page for 30 days, during which it will be read-only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2apxL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 27th 10:15AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds comment from Facebook spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get in on this week’s best tech deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89o_6EWiilz0oaXZGSzC_IXfAmY=/0x56:2529x1742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69035366/VizioOLED.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wqJkb2"&gt;Would you believe that it’s Friday already? That means it’s time for this week’s roundup of tech deals that are better than the rest. We comb through hundreds of deals from a variety of retailers each week, picking only the best sales to tell you about. By the time Friday comes around, some of them have usually expired, but we’ve included the good ones that are still happening below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IQdYO"&gt;Enjoy the weather this weekend if it’s starting to get nice outside where you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oAKYTw"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gF9219"&gt;Save $10 on &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; before it’s discontinued on March 31st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqyqt"&gt;For reasons only Nintendo can explain, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt; will no longer be produced after March 31st. Even the digital version of the game will be delisted on the eShop. So if you want the game while it’s still relatively easy to find (and affordable to buy), head over to Walmart where you can get the compilation that contains &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Sunshine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; for $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATwu7M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LJCK37"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gFqFmT"&gt;Save $150 on Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones by buying refurbished at eBay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E3i83I"&gt;Normally, we recommend buying products new when possible (especially headphones), but this deal’s too good to pass up. At eBay, a well-rated seller is offering a like-new set of Sony’s high-end noise-canceling headphones for $208 before tax (originally $349 new). And with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKCR5 &lt;/strong&gt;added at checkout, you can knock the price down to $198.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgD3xt"&gt;We feature deals on this model a lot. And there’s a reason for that: they sound fantastic, and they’re comfortable. If you want to see what they’re all about — and save a bunch of money — check out this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Y0tjZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10411678" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="unDnzE"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NB7xHF"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV is back down to $1,000 at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aLRrlQ"&gt;It’s been about a month and change since Vizio knocked the price of its debut OLED TV down to $1,000, but that time has returned. This model’s OLED panel has unparalleled picture quality and color accuracy compared to LCD, and its HDMI 2.1 ports allow the Xbox Series X, PS5, and PCs with certain graphics cards to display up to 4K at 120 frames per second in games that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5U9oWS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pXftAc"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c6v6PQ"&gt;Save $10 on &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gBk7yo"&gt;At eBay, you can get the new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F284205856974%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F27%2F22352334%2Fvizio-oled-4k-hdr-tv-sony-wh1000xm4-headphones-deal-sale-amazon-ebay-best-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; for $50&lt;/a&gt; instead of $60. It’s a small discount for the game, which just released Friday, March 26th. But if you wanted to jump in (and can wait a few days for this physical edition to deliver), you’ll save a bit with this deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Check out our review&lt;/a&gt; for this game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose Frames Tempo review: the specs to beat</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Bose’s sporty shades offer good sound, a steady fit, and total awareness&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FNpYyb"&gt;It’s still fair to call audio sunglasses a niche category, but with Bose offering several models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Amazon in the game&lt;/a&gt;, and counting recent announcements from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314474/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-announced-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22219425/jlab-audio-jbuds-frames-open-ear-headphones-price-release-date"&gt;JLab&lt;/a&gt;, it’s certainly a growing one. There are people out there who just aren’t particularly fond of earbuds — often because they dislike the feeling of silicone tips plugging up their ears. Open-style products like the standard AirPods and Galaxy Buds Live are one alternative, but then you still face the possibility of losing them. If you’re running on a trail or out for an intense bike ride, it’s not an insignificant risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7ENkh"&gt;For those people, I can absolutely see the appeal of the Bose Frames Tempo, which have speakers built right into their frame and will stay planted on their face no matter how strenuous outdoor activity gets. The Tempo glasses are the sportiest model of Bose’s Frames family, clearly geared at hikers, runners, cyclists, and anyone else who spends a good chunk of their time outside. Bose says they’ve also got the best sound performance of the bunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFRdRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10414314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejbqly"&gt;From the front, they look like your typical pair of Oakley, Nike, or Under Armour sunglasses. Bose is clearly going after that same market with the $250 Tempos. If you’re more fashion-forward or looking for a pair of audio sunglasses that don’t give the impression you’re in the middle of a triathlon, you’ll want to stick with the Tenor or Soprano styles of Frames. These come with black mirrored lenses in the box, but Bose also sells a couple of other pairs of $40 lenses that you can swap in to let different amounts of light pass through. The oversized temples are where it becomes more obvious that these are audio sunglasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnX4us"&gt;But there’s a benefit to that chunky design: unlike the Tenor and Soprano Frames, which use a proprietary charger, the Tempo model has a regular USB-C connector on the left temple. Bose says the frame is made from “TR-90 nylon.” There’s not much give, but they feel rugged to me, and they’ve got an IPX4 water and sweat resistance rating, so if you get caught running or biking in the rain, they’ll survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/31eYWBrkY8nTLxTrG9Wu6O0Vs7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297692/cwelch_200927_4359_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The large temples are the obvious tell that these are audio sunglasses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C5-w4FzhCl2WmB3MC2SAh-YuzDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297697/cwelch_200927_4359_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Frames Tempo have simple controls that let you stay focused on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q8gtu0rHkK8xmhoe_hgSeyaNoEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297700/cwelch_200927_4359_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three sizes of nose pads come included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Y8ORN"&gt;For the first couple of days wearing the Tempos, I felt a slight squeeze at the sides of my head that got uncomfortable. Now, I’ve got an extremely large dome — they used to have to bring out a special-sized helmet in Little League, friends — but thankfully, the fit loosened up a bit because this pressure went away by the end of the first week. The sunglasses didn’t get loose enough to where they started bobbing on my head or anything; they still felt nice and secure. (My friend Theresa, who has a normal-sized head, never mentioned any headache-inducing tightness.) Bose includes three sizes of nose tips in the box, and I found the large to be the right match. Even if my face was covered in sweat from a long run, the nose tips helped ensure the sunglasses didn’t slide around. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1g2o-AkX8tJRZDQdhItRqKiaEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297695/cwelch_200927_4359_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frames have an IPX4 rating for water and sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uyqKV7"&gt;The controls that Bose came up with are wonderfully foolproof, which is crucial when you’re trying to stay focused on other things. You swipe across the right temple to raise or lower the volume, and on the underside of that temple is a small circular button that you can press to play / pause, double-tap to skip tracks, or triple-tap to go back. In no time at all, these controls felt so natural and &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. Powering off the Frames Tempo just takes holding down the button for a few seconds. Or you can flip them over and lay them down with the top of the frame on a surface. After two seconds in that orientation, they shut off. (You can disable this in settings, but I found it really convenient and, again, natural.) Battery life is listed as eight hours, and that’s lined up with my experience so far. The sunglasses take roughly an hour to charge back to 100 percent. Bose’s mobile app lets you update the sunglasses’ firmware, but there aren’t any EQ controls or other options that adjust their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0H3LshrVobE92af08xzWK5myl4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297702/cwelch_200927_4359_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sunglasses stay firmly in place through all sorts of outdoor activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DWoQIu"&gt;Describing the sound quality of audio sunglasses can be tricky. They’re nothing like headphones or earbuds since these are essentially down-firing speakers pointed at your ears. But Bose stepped up its game compared to the first-generation Frames, which I’ve tried on occasion. These have more life to them across the whole EQ range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="NGrMoF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10414391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kop70c"&gt;There’s a surprising amount of separation between vocals and instrumentation, and the Frames Tempo have a nice clarity and even-handed balance. There’s more bass than before, but this is where I think it’s most important to set reasonable expectations: the low end you get from any decent pair of in-ear buds will blow these out of the water. No contest. That said, Bose has at least reached a place where the bass no longer sounds anemic or flat, which is a legitimate improvement over the first-gen Frames. It’s there and perceptible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsBupf"&gt;Sound bleed is easily canceled out by everyday street noise, but if you’re inside with the volume turned up, people nearby will be able to tell that you’re listening to music. These are sunglasses, after all, so I imagine those situations will be few and far between. The Bluetooth connection has held stable throughout the vast majority of my time with the Frames Tempo so far. No complaints there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZPrsZ"&gt;Voice calls while wearing the Tempos have also been a joy. Callers say I sound nearly as good as when speaking directly into my phone, and something about taking calls with your ears totally open just feels very cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnzrc3nz17qM7RC_2LLjDsfjCxk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399542/cwelch_200927_4359_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose sells additional $40 pairs of lenses that let in different amounts of light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mlr5M"&gt;Even after a relatively short time using the Frames Tempo, I get this audio glasses thing. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding"&gt;It’s like Dieter recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “Not having to put in or take out headphones changes your relationship to audio — it’s just always available, always there when you want it.” Do I wish I could pop clear lenses into them and wear them everywhere? In theory, you bet. But this style wouldn’t really work for that, nor is it what the Tempos are meant to be at the end of the day. So I can’t knock Bose for the disappointment I feel when switching back to my normal glasses, which now seem so very primitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FnaDAD"&gt;The Bose Frames Tempo let you hear the world around you with no obstructions — with a soundtrack playing over everything, while at the same time giving your ears a bit of a break compared to normal earbuds. At $250, they will be a tough sell for some. But I’ve come to realize that audio sunglasses are the exact sort of thing you won’t ever realize you needed. Until you put ‘em on — and all of a sudden, you do. &lt;/p&gt;
