    <title>FDA authorizes first COVID-19 antiviral pill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Pdr2vK-iH9CeT9rK0tLkT57rWE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306483/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osVEYg"&gt;On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; the first antiviral pill to treat COVID-19, a move that gives doctors another tool to fight the disease. The treatment, made by Pfizer, curbs the risk of hospitalization and death in high-risk patients infected with the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9OPYf"&gt;Called Paxlovid, the treatment includes 30 pills taken at home over five days. It has to be started within a few days of symptoms — which could be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/health/covid-pill.html"&gt;a challenge&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, where it may be difficult for many people to get a COVID-19 test, a result, and see a doctor for a prescription in that window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAPtSm"&gt;Paxlovid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765110/pfizer-antiviral-hospitalization-death-covid"&gt;cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent&lt;/a&gt; for adults with COVID-19 at high risk of developing severe disease when it was given within three days of symptoms appearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt3iSA"&gt;The FDA is also reviewing a second COVID-19 antiviral, called molnupiravir, which is made by pharmaceutical company Merck. That drug appears less effective than Paxlovid — a clinical trial found it only reduces the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/science/merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-covid-pill.html"&gt;by 30 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le4AQO"&gt;Pills are cheaper and easier to use than monoclonal antibody therapies, which have been a major treatment used for people after they contract COVID-19. Those require an infusion. Pills also &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/pfizer-says-its-pill-may-be-effective-against-omicron-covid-19"&gt;may remain as effective&lt;/a&gt; against the omicron variant of the coronavirus as against other variants, like delta. The drugs target proteins that help the coronavirus make copies of itself — and the newly discovered variant does not have many mutations in that part of the virus. Most monoclonal antibodies appear &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/health/covid-monoclonal-antibodies-omicron.html"&gt;ineffective&lt;/a&gt; against the omicron variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzP97o"&gt;The Biden administration expects to have 250,000 courses of the Pfizer pills available by the end of January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/biden-team-plans-4-million-doses-of-covid-treatments-in-january?srnd=premium&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSpatc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XW09l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reinstates mask mandate for warehouse employees as omicron threat looms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/43aeKCufiOjP6h4BZILaT8whMQU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306267/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQH9r0"&gt;Amazon’s warehouse employees across the US will once again have to wear masks, according to an internal notice obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/22/amazon-revives-mask-mandate-for-warehouse-workers-amid-omicron-threat.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company reinstated its mask mandate as the omicron variant continues to spread during Amazon’s busiest time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SwnFiN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has been changing its stance on mask mandates throughout the year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1F5Upo"&gt;In the message sent to employees, Amazon said that all warehouse workers must wear masks, regardless of vaccination status or local mask requirements. “Your health and safety are of the utmost importance to us,” the notice read. “In response to the rapid spread of the Covid-19 omicron variant in the US and guidance from public health authorities and our own medical experts, face coverings are again required for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KthCvd"&gt;Amazon has been changing its stance on mask mandates throughout the year. The company initially &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;stopped requiring facial coverings in May&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613542/amazon-warehouse-mask-mandate"&gt;revived the mask mandate in August&lt;/a&gt;. It briefly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757927/amazon-lifts-mask-mandates-vaccinated-warehouse-employees"&gt;lifted its mask mandate in November&lt;/a&gt; before reinstating it again starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyLxiu"&gt;Companies in the tech industry have been taking very different approaches to COVID-19 safety requirements. While Amazon hasn’t said it will require employees to get vaccinated, Intel and Google have taken things a bit further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849074/intel-unvaccinated-employees-unpaid-leave"&gt;Unvaccinated employees at Intel could eventually face unpaid leave&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;those still unvaccinated at Google&lt;/a&gt; may be put on leave or even fired next year. Just like Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738265/apple-vaccine-requirement-daily-covid-19-tests"&gt;Apple also isn’t requiring employees to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; and has instead asked unvaccinated employees to take tests more frequently — recently, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;number of stores&lt;/a&gt; due to COVID-19 outbreaks among employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUEGXz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Amazon with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla investigated over reports drivers can play its video games while vehicles are moving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUsZKLgoDoPIyR_OuTTgXOSMYKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306171/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NHTSA is investigating Tesla vehicles that allow games on their touchscreens | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fAOanM"&gt;The US government says it is investigating more than half a million Tesla vehicles sold since 2017, following reports that drivers can play video games available on its main display screen while driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxRudB"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says it received a complaint in August that said live games and internet web searching — which were supposedly restricted to passenger use only while the car was in motion — could be played by anyone in the vehicle at any time. Its Office of Defects and Investigations &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120234/INOA_PE21023_9605.PDF"&gt;said in a report&lt;/a&gt; that it “confirmed that this capability has been available since December 2020 in Tesla ‘Passenger Play’-equipped vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCAVaY"&gt;ODI’s preliminary evaluation will include an estimated 580,000 Tesla Model 3, Model S, and Model X vehicles sold between model years 2017 and 2022 “based on reports that Tesla gameplay functionality, which is visible on the front center touchscreen from the driver’s seat, is enabled even when the vehicle is being driven. This functionality, referred to as ‘Passenger Play,’ may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash,” according to the ODI report. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla’s Arcade games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6cJ1iJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported earlier this month that Tesla updated the playable video games in most of its vehicles in an over-the-air software update this summer. The update allowed some of the games to be played on center touch screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;while the vehicles are in motion&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the update, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;Tesla Arcade games&lt;/a&gt; could only be played while a vehicle was parked. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;confirmed that a notification pops up when the games launch, and a user has to tap an “I am a passenger” confirmation button before playing. There’s little to prevent a driver from tapping the button and playing the games, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tVFUUC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Tesla Arcade hands-on: using a Model 3 steering wheel as a game controller","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vGeAZ6"&gt;“Why is a manufacturer allowed to create an inherently distracting live video which takes over 2/3 of the screen which the driver relies on for all vehicle information?” the &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23120243/NHTSA_Safety_Issues.pdf"&gt;complainant asked&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJxKd8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Tesla for comment on the investigation, but after &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/06/tesla-dissolves-pr-department/"&gt;dissolving&lt;/a&gt; its press office in 2020, the company rarely replies to media inquiries. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doctor Strange 2’s first trailer goes mad for multiverses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZ_Mzu5Xu76r6glm5msw7D0PpQw=/459x0:1932x982/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306111/Screen_Shot_2021_12_22_at_11.10.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNGEOn"&gt;Marvel’s journey into the multiverse is barreling forward with the first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, a sequel to 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; and what promises to be the MCU’s biggest foray yet into the alternate worlds and timelines that installments like &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; have begun to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1RhYEG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home swings big on two decades of fan payoff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834061/spider-man-no-way-home-review-tom-holland-marvel-multiverse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="IieYm3"&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;will be picking up on a breathtaking number of extant story threads in the MCU. It’s a follow-up to Doctor Strange’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) most recent appearance in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834061/spider-man-no-way-home-review-tom-holland-marvel-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where he helped Peter Parker do some &lt;em&gt;mild&lt;/em&gt; tampering with the fabric of reality. It’ll pick up on the revelations around Wanda Maximoff / The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) from &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;. Baron Mordo’s quest to cut down on the number of sorcerers meddling with magic from &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;’s post-credit sequence is back in play, as is what appears to be a darker version of Strange himself that previously appeared in the animated &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XcVmuD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s tons of MCU tie ins here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMqDUw"&gt;That’s all in addition to everything new in the trailer, including more of the mind-bending landscapes that made the original Doctor Strange so visually arresting and characters like America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) and a giant eyeball monster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WADIGa"&gt;The trailer originally was released as the final post-credit scene for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; earlier in December, but Marvel has now put it online for everyone to see (pro-tip: this now also means that you don’t have to stick around for the entire credits if you see No Way Home over the next few weeks.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzlam7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on May 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The green Apple Watch Series 7 has hit a new low price of $339</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjqRY19GOwvU-Vjtm1-pw1VSzSU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306095/vpavic_211006_4796_0102.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 and its larger screen has a full keyboard for tapping and gesture swiping.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmZPUj"&gt;It’s beginning to look a lot like Dealsmas, now that we’re just a few days away from the holiday and there are still some excellent gifts to get before time truly runs out. While we have been tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22840189/christmas-gifts-best-last-minute-tech-gaming-gadgets-shipping"&gt;some gift ideas this week that still arrive in time&lt;/a&gt;, today, let’s bear down on a bunch of excellent sales — some on frequently discounted products that hit new low prices and others on newly launched gadgets to cut you early adopters a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4fB7bA"&gt;Leading us off, it just isn’t the holiday season without a great Apple Watch deal — and in such a festive color. The green Apple Watch Series 7 may appear darker in person than in some photographs, but right now, it’s the cheapest way to get the latest smartwatch from Apple. You can pick up the base 41mm GPS model in green with a matching sport band for $339 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggaILWHuLd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a savings of $60 and the lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll8DMm"&gt;Apple’s latest watch offers a larger display that stretches further out to the edges, and it’s more rugged than ever with IP6X dust resistance. This deal drops the price another $10 below the previous best discount we’ve seen, and if you make your move quick enough, it should arrive in time for Christmas from either retailer. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Bnwmo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4cOOjg"&gt;Turning from the world of smartwatches to the world of smart... lamps? No, it’s a speaker? Wait, do they know what it actually looks like? (They make smart versions of that as well, don’t they...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEbQYW"&gt;OK! Jokes aside, Sony’s new LSP-X3 combination lamp speaker may look like a fancy bong, but it’s actually a connected gadget that can help set the mood with light and audio. This portable Bluetooth speaker is all about vibes, as the glass-encased candlelight-style LED can mimic the flicker effect of an actual candle while you relax to your tunes (perhaps &lt;em&gt;The Grateful Dead&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Phish&lt;/em&gt;?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSVTp3"&gt;The Sony LSP-X3 was just released, but it is already discounted to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Directional-Candle-Like-Illumination-Bluetooth/dp/B09984VQCS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$248 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgga4qRyTs0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$249.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is about $100 off its sticker price. It still arrives in time for Christmas, so you can gift it to a loved one and record their confused reaction when they open it and wonder just what kind of stuff you think they’re into. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834645/sony-glass-sound-speaker-lspxs3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iieR33"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10943883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WOkOHK"&gt;Staying within Sony’s world of audio devices for a moment, though getting back to much more conventional designs, the new Sony WF-C500 wireless earbuds are another new product that can be picked up for early discounts. We gave this one a quick mention yesterday while it was part of Amazon’s deal of the day and priced at just $58, but if you missed out, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-resistance/dp/B09CFP6J6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can still pick it up today for $68&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8cfVz"&gt;Normally priced at $100, these earbuds offer a great value proposition for great sound and 10 hours of continuous battery life during playback. This deal ships after Christmas, but you may be hard-pressed to find this quality at the price. Remember, late Christmas gift rhymes with great Christmas gift. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828293/sony-wf-c500-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="E69TUc"&gt;For the Samsung fans in the audience, the flagship Galaxy Buds Pro are a well-established set of quality earbuds that feature active noise cancellation and a great balance of sound quality and comfort. They tick all the boxes that some models leave out, like good quality audio during phone calls, thanks to their triple microphone array with beamforming. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggbBfLseZD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggbBOtPTYt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Resistant/dp/B08MWY75DH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are selling the Galaxy Buds Pro for just $129.99 in violet, silver, and black colorways — a discount of $70 that matches their all-time low price. Each retailer indicates that these discounted buds should still arrive in time for Christmas. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="naw7Vt"&gt;The holidays offer a great time to catch up on the year’s back catalog of excellent video game titles, and if you’re an Xbox or PC player in need of extra controllers for some local multiplayer, then you’re currently in luck. Amazon has discounts on the standard Xbox Series X / S controllers in some vibrant colors, including the tennis ball green &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08ZNQN1FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;electric volt&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B0859XT328?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pulse red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Electric-Windows-Devices/dp/B08DFB488B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shock blue&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these is about $50 at checkout, discounted from their usual prices of $64.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPqOpx"&gt;While the standard Xbox controller is a quality gamepad, if you prefer something even more premium, you can opt for the Xbox Elite Series 2. This customizable, pro-level controller is currently on sale for its best price of $139.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cggbTBFk9l4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkGwtm0F1ykOzY0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0zA1fV0zexyIUYsSg4xd4WrFUkGwtm0F1ykOzY0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeal122221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; ($40 off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YmIsJR"&gt;Changing gears from gaming to Google, if you haven’t bought into a smart home system, it may feel challenging to consider where to begin. If you’re partial to the Google Assistant, the current deal from Lowe’s on the Google Nest Mini (second-gen) with a GE smart plug adapter may be one of the easiest ways to get your toe in the water. The bundle normally runs $59.99, but you can get it from &lt;a href="https://lowes.sjv.io/c/482924/897039/12374?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd%2FGoogle-Nest-Mini-2nd-Gen-Google-Assistant-in-Chalk-Smart-Plug-Bundle%2F1003163360&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals102621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lowe’s for $24.99&lt;/a&gt; until the new year. It will not ship in time for Christmas, but you might be able to find it available for store pickup at a Lowe’s near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JF15ZR"&gt;This can make an excellent gift for a family member who just wants to be able to say, “Hey Google, turn off the light,” with a traditional light source, or you can plant it at your in-laws’ house (with their permission) to easily reset their router when they call you about internet trouble. The Nest Mini (second-gen) is also a solid little speaker for listening to music, so this bundle is very versatile for just $25. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wVr3Li"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828312"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Zillow adds support for iOS 15’s SharePlay, so you can look at homes together from your studio apartments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02gu41lKchaj0mJQdxMrRrm9iEE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70306018/FINAL_Zillow_SharePlay_Screenshot_1920x1080_122121.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Zillow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxnJFo"&gt;Have you ever wanted to aimlessly scroll through Zillow and admire all the heinously expensive houses that you’ll never be able to afford thanks to the skyrocketing price of real estate — but also share that experience with a friend or loved one who isn’t able to join you in your &lt;s&gt;delusional&lt;/s&gt; aspirational browsing in real life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ab3f31"&gt;Well, Zillow has debuted the solution to that dubiously common problem by adding support for Apple’s new SharePlay feature to its iPhone and iPad apps. Which, in turn, allows you to browse listings (something that Zillow — a company that appears to be completely unfamiliar with the existence of baseball — describes in its press release as “America’s favorite pastime”) over FaceTime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qFNfmq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An odd use for Apple’s new FaceTime sharing feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9PofEn"&gt;In Zillow’s defense, the company says that 86 percent of its users browse listings with a friend, spouse, or roommate, so making it easier to do over video conferencing does make a certain amount of sense when viewed in that light. And given that SharePlay has native API support in iOS, it can’t be too difficult to integrate support (especially for an app that doesn’t have to worry about things like authenticating streaming logins or perfectly syncing video and audio playback, like streaming apps do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5fFjk"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in Zillow is available now, although you’ll need to make sure that your device is updated to iOS 15.1 or iPadOS 15.1 or later in order to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jonUi5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSVpxq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Costco members can order the Xbox Series X right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IWyYhsVrT8HRt-mMne6msm-30eU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305919/acastro_210511_1777_xboxRestock_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b03dj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 11:57AM ET, December 22nd:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Costco has sold out of consoles for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2yvOx"&gt;The Xbox Series X console has remained hard to come by, and with the holidays looming the window to get one in time is narrowing. Many retailers have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;charging for the chance&lt;/a&gt; just to buy a console via subscription-based memberships, which is a game that Costco has been playing from the beginning. The warehouse retailer has gotten its fair share of console restocks, and today it has Microsoft’s flagship console available for its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI1ZxG"&gt;You can order the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-x-1tb-console-with-additional-controller.product.100691493.html"&gt;Xbox Series X from Costco&lt;/a&gt; right now, which is only sold as a bundle with an extra controller. You need a paid Costco membership to order this, which you can get &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html?redirectLogin=true"&gt;here at the retailer’s site&lt;/a&gt; for a minimum of $60 per year. While some video games and accessories can be purchased online from Costco by non-members at the cost of an additional fee, consoles are for members only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z86GFW"&gt;These restocks at Costco often sell out quickly, so if you don’t manage to get it this time around be sure to prep your account for success next time by saving your billing and shipping info into your account.

    <title>Listen to these wild sounds NASA recorded from Jupiter’s moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GdAc2VaVSxecY0tKsoMmMO8F1qM=/0x34:800x567/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305771/2657_Juno_Ganyede_Close_Up_800x600.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A preliminary close-up image of Ganymede obtained by the JunoCam imager&lt;/strong&gt; | Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQ3O3t"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-juno-spacecraft-hears-jupiter-s-moon/"&gt;unveiled a 50-second audio clip&lt;/a&gt; from Juno’s Ganymede flyby at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting on Friday. Generated from data captured on June 7th during the spacecraft’s closest approach yet to Ganymede, the sound, similar to a robot or dial-up modem, is the latest fascinating return from the Juno mission’s years-long exploration of the Solar System’s largest gas giant and its moons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC8UCf"&gt;The audio comes from data gathered using &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/juno/science/"&gt;Juno’s Waves instrument&lt;/a&gt;, designed to measure radio and plasma waves detected in Jupiter’s magnetosphere, the bubble of charged particles that envelop the gas giant. Ganymede is Jupiter’s largest moon and the only moon in the Solar System to have a magnetosphere of its own. The emissions data collected from Ganymede was shifted to an audio range to make the recording, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDRSIc"&gt;“This soundtrack is just wild enough to make you feel as if you were riding along as Juno sails past Ganymede for the first time in more than two decades,” Juno principal investigator Scott Bolden of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFHzIf"&gt;Days prior to the audio being retrieved, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-to-get-a-close-look-at-jupiters-moon-ganymede"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Juno spacecraft was going to be within 645 miles of the surface of Ganymede, the closest it has ever been to it. The flyby provided a unique opportunity to study the moon, which hadn’t seen a spacecraft approach it this closely since NASA’s Galileo probe sailed past in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZAhR0"&gt;Scientists are continuing to study the Waves data collected during the Juno flyby and attempting to decode what frequency changes present within the recording mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xZmVlI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_09R6jIo74U?rel=0&amp;amp;start=49" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbKhp2"&gt;In addition to the audio track, other speakers at AGU provided updates on their latest findings of the Juno mission, including further exploration of Jupiter’s magnetosphere.  According to new findings gathered from a magnetic anomaly near Jupiter’s equator known as the Great Blue Spot, Jupiter has experienced a change in its magnetic field during the last five years, and the Great Blue Spot is slowly drifting eastward at approximately 2 inches per second, taking 350 years to make its way around the planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cueLvf"&gt;The more familiar Great Red Spot, a violent anticyclone just south of the equator, drifts the opposite way at a faster pace, circling the planet every four and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hawkeye’s first season is a welcome holiday surprise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-piQVtJNfDyDwNDkEwcgrfR-9bw=/0x0:6029x4019/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305745/APT_106_12941_R2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A fun romp with some important MCU connections&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="efzNDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is the most unassuming of the Marvel shows on Disney Plus so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aneNg"&gt;It doesn’t have the immediate hook of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s time-bending story or &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s surreal take on sitcoms. It also stars arguably the most forgettable of all the Avengers, one who is getting a big spotlight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22561250/black-widow-marvel-endgame-thor-age-of-ultron"&gt;while other, more notable characters get movies that come years too late&lt;/a&gt;. And yet… there’s something about its blend of detective story, MCU action, and charming Christmas vibe that just works. Across its six episodes, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; manages to balance being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22796664/hawkeye-early-review-disney-plus"&gt;a superhero show that doesn’t take itself too seriously&lt;/a&gt; with all of the complex storytelling elements that come with being part of the Marvel universe. The fact that it pulls it all off so well is something of a Christmas miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIczgC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This review contains some light spoilers for the first season of Hawkeye.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxbsSV"&gt;Despite the name, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a show just about Jeremy Renner’s take on the bow-wielding hero Clint Barton. He’s a big part of it, sure, but the story is just as much about his wannabe protégé Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld). The two are forced together after Kate dons the costume of a vigilante known as the Ronin — formerly worn by Clint — putting her in the crosshairs of some very dangerous people. Clint just wants to be left alone to spend time with his family over the holidays, while Kate, who grew up idolizing Hawkeye, couldn’t be more thrilled about being forced together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCzqet"&gt;The show’s main strength is how the two play off each other. Kate is exceedingly charming, a playful mess who is constantly in over her head, and yet usually able to talk her way out of it. Clint is the opposite: sullen, pessimistic, but prepared like Batman. The story is structured a bit like a detective story, at least at first, with the two investigating a bunch of shady people connected to the Ronin. Oh, and also, it’s Christmas in New York. This all lends the show a gritty-yet-playful vibe that suits it well, where gunfights are interrupted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811932/hawkeye-usb-arrow-dongle"&gt;quips about USB standards&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t take too long before the show intersects with the rest of the MCU — and it does so from a few different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eejNJTStJ0WMJFw7sFcNE40mgeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119996/APT_105_09351_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2hYFn7"&gt;One of the main connections was teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567297/black-widows-post-credit-scene-explained-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;at the end of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Yelena (Florence Pugh) vows to avenge her sister’s death by killing Clint. When she does show up to do just that, she’s equal parts menacing and hilarious (much like in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;), a trained-from-birth killer who is also trying to do some normal human stuff now that she’s (sort of) free. Pugh and Steinfeld have incredible chemistry — Steinfeld seems to have great chemistry with just about everyone — and it’s a lot of fun to watch them talk life and death over a pot of macaroni and cheese, discussing everything from a planned killing to Rudolph, the “super-powered reindeer.” Later on, the two can’t stop complimenting each other in the midst of a brutal fistfight, with Kate telling Yelena, “Stop making me like you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtAsd2"&gt;While Marvel fans knew that one was coming, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; big connection is much more unexpected. The big bad of season 1 is the criminal overlord Kingpin, and in this case, he’s played by Vincent D’Onofrio, who also had the role on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965518/daredevil-season-3-review-netflix-marvel-kingpin-bullseye-charlie-cox-erik-oleson"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unexpected primarily because, since the launch of Disney Plus and the new wave of MCU streaming series that came with it, the fate of the Netflix shows and characters has been a source of much debate. All I’m saying is, next time an MCU character needs some help with an investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18660027/jessica-jones-season-3-review-netflix-marvel-cinematic-universe-krysten-ritter"&gt;Jessica Jones is right there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVLW0B"&gt;These kinds of crossovers are common for Marvel, and for the most part, they don’t feel too obtrusive here. (Nothing is as bad as, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577248/loki-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Jonathan Majors’ monologue at the end of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;) The reveals hit a little harder if you know what’s already happened — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22555587/black-widow-review-disney-plus-marvel"&gt;I would recommend at least watching &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; first&lt;/a&gt; — but otherwise, the background knowledge isn’t strictly necessary to understand that Kingpin is a mob mastermind, and Yelena is a charming assassin. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; balances things nicely, making it work fairly well both for the die-hards and those coming in fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mfP9eBj8RT_AJWlsvrE0BfJOgaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119998/APT_105_22899.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EZfiTE"&gt;There are maybe a few too many threads happening concurrently, though, particularly towards the end. There’s an important villain reveal; the inevitable showdown between Clint and Yelena; the debut of some much-teased superhero costumes; a pivotal moment for Echo (Alaqua Cox), &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22811806/echo-hawkeye-cast-explained-alaqua-cox"&gt;a future hero who starts out as a criminal&lt;/a&gt;; Kate’s seeming ascendance to Hawkeye-level hero; and of course, a tease for what comes next, which in this case appears to involve Clint’s wife, Laura Barton (Linda Cardellini). (Surprisingly, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have the traditional MCU big reveal after the credits; instead, viewers get to watch a full-song performance from the goofy Avengers musical from the first episode.) There’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; going on — at one point in the finale, there are three pivotal fights happening concurrently — and the last episode rushes through some of them without giving much time for the heavy moments to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tKDyZX"&gt;This kind of balancing act is, of course, key to the whole Marvel machine, where every story is just one cog in a much bigger machine. &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; pulls it off as well as any of its contemporaries. It works as a standalone story, a fun romp through Christmas in New York, while also weaving in multiple threads from various other Marvel stories &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; setting up at least two more. All that in just six episodes — and while rehabilitating Clint Barton into a hero you finally care about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fight climate change by eating your leftovers this holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lW_fOnm_eEVGohPfZv7BDxaudIs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70305729/VRG_Illo_4941_Kristen_Radtke_Food_Waste.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MNQgZF"&gt;In my family, there are two traditions when it comes to holiday meals: there must be way more food on the table than everyone can eat, and everyone must take home a plate of food at the end of the meal to make sure all the hard work that went into its preparation wasn’t wasted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9T7NTw"&gt;While small holiday gatherings have become the norm in my house in recent years, my mom still prepares big portions. When I asked her why, it boiled down to wanting to make sure there was enough for everyone, not just to enjoy the meal but to enjoy leftovers for as long as they wanted. That seemed perfectly reasonable to me — until I learned what a problem those leftovers are for the planet if they go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0uP2H"&gt;The holidays are a busy time for trash collectors. Americans &lt;a href="https://lbre.stanford.edu/pssistanford-recycling/frequently-asked-questions/frequently-asked-questions-holiday-waste-prevention"&gt;throw away&lt;/a&gt; 25 percent more trash between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, including things like plastic from old tech and gift wrap. Food waste, which accounts for 30 to 40 percent of waste entering landfills year-round, also rises sharply during the holidays. During Thanksgiving week alone, Americans throw out roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/yvette-cabrera/giving-thanks-and-wasting-less"&gt;200 million pounds&lt;/a&gt; of turkey meat, along with &lt;a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/blog/post/impact-food-waste-during-thanksgiving"&gt;30 million pounds of gravy and 14 million pounds of dinner rolls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYgdic"&gt;All told, that wasted food takes a serious toll on the planet. When thrown-away food makes its way to landfills and rots, it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. That’s on top of the pollution released during the production of lost and wasted food — equivalent to &lt;a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fight-climate-change-by-preventing-food-waste"&gt;32.6 million cars’ worth&lt;/a&gt; of greenhouse gas emissions in the US alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6SemO"&gt;Globally, the situation is even worse. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) stated in its &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021"&gt;2021 Food Waste Index&lt;/a&gt; that if food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet, accounting for a staggering 10 percent of the total. Despite its obvious impact, food waste at the retail and consumer level and loss along the supply chain typically aren’t a focus in global climate change conversations, including the recent UN climate summit in Glasgow. “People don’t see the link at all,” Liz Goodwin, director of food loss and waste at the World Resources Institute, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It was disappointing that we had COP26, and food was hardly on the agenda.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygxQy7"&gt;That said, change is starting to happen on a smaller scale. States and local governments across the US have taken note of how food waste and climate change intertwine and are enacting pilot programs or new rules to crack down on waste. Composting programs, both municipal and independently run, are making inroads in US cities and states looking to reduce the amount of waste entering landfills and cut greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50BoVt"&gt;Chris Wood, co-president of Moonshot Compost, a Houston-based composting company, said there’s a real opportunity in attracting people to composting services. Composting companies work with households, offices, and businesses by collecting their food waste via curbside collection programs or at drop-off locations around the city. For Wood and co-president Joe Villa, an uptick in demand for their composting service came during the pandemic when residents began paying closer attention to how much food they were buying due to them spending more time at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iaKn8"&gt;Composting services give community members an opportunity to reduce their food waste, but participation in these programs is voluntary. In California, a &lt;a href="https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/organics/slcp"&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; requiring residents to separate all organic material like food and yard waste from their other garbage is set to go into effect on January 1st. City and county trash services will collect the food waste and turn it into &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2021/12/20/calif-law-will-turn-banana-peels-into-renewable-energy-284450"&gt;compost or renewable biogas&lt;/a&gt;. Grocery stores, meanwhile, will be required to donate any edible food they collect to organizations like food banks, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-makes-food-waste-recycling-mandatory-ac4340dc4d0b6d74e186b22c1ef7c933"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ehzicv"&gt;California’s law follows a similar one in Vermont, which banned throwing out food with the trash last year, &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;said. Eventually, the Golden State could fine $10,000 to cities and counties that don’t comply with the rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdpMRX"&gt;Streamlining food date labels could also reduce food waste. With no national standards around these labels and manufacturers using &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/food-product-dating"&gt;numerous phrases&lt;/a&gt; to indicate shelf life like best by, expires on, use by, sell by and more, consumers are often left guessing how good a piece of food is to eat by smelling it or eyeballing it. Or, not wanting to take a chance, they may choose to throw away perfectly good food if the label date has passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ielgB"&gt;“The absence of having standard, clear labels means that the consumer is forced to trust the date blindly,” Marie Spiker, a researcher and assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Consumers end up throwing away a lot of food they don’t have to, and the burden is on the consumer to do a lot of research.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km5ciD"&gt;Reducing food waste through sound policy will ultimately help us tackle climate change. If done correctly, such policies could also alleviate food insecurity. Grocery stores giving food that would otherwise be thrown out to food banks could help some of the &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/54-million-people-america-face-food-insecurity-during-pandemic-it-could-have-dire-consequences-their"&gt;54 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are food insecure get their next meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5gLdw"&gt;But individual action can also play a huge role in tackling food waste, particularly in the US, where households waste roughly &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanabandoim/2020/01/26/the-shocking-amount-of-food-us-households-waste-every-year/?sh=3714c667dc8e"&gt;32 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the food they buy on average. Put another way, a family of four throws out about &lt;a href="https://www.rubicon.com/blog/food-waste-facts/"&gt;$1,500 worth of food each year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WV8Iko"&gt;“One of the most powerful tools we have is just to directly decrease our own waste in our homes,” Spiker said. “It’s also really challenging to do because most of our waste is happening in this very diffuse way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aCZ9B"&gt;When I started thinking about how my family and I prepare meals during the holidays, it became clear that we could be doing more to reduce food waste and that planning goes a long way. While we’re cooking our plates of sides and mac and cheese, one of the things I’ll be thinking about is how to repurpose the leftovers. I’m also asking myself if the portions we’re cooking are realistic and where we can cut back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nruMjn"&gt;In the midst of a holiday season where climate change is an urgent reality, I have an opportunity to be mindful of the waste I create and, by doing so, help those who don’t have the time or resources to think about sustainability. It’s a small step, but if enough other people take similar action, it’ll give the planet a breather at a time when that’s badly needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFoIns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 22nd, 11:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story misquoted Spiker as saying the lack of clear food labels means consumers are forced to trust data blindly. In fact, she said consumers are forced to trust the date blindly. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
