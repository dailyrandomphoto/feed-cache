    <title>Samsung shows off stretchable OLED screen in prototype heart rate monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQBOk0fK5CS767MqVaDy8VN1ORg=/6x0:869x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69416813/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.45.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s prototype heart rate monitor with stretchable OLED display. &lt;/em&gt; | Image &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung / SAIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z2rYMu"&gt;We’ve had curved displays for a while now, but what about stretchy ones? Samsung says it’s &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;making progress&lt;/a&gt; building screens “that can be stretched in all directions like rubber bands,”  and that the first applications for this material could be in building flexible health tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2idnEW"&gt;The company’s researchers recently created an OLED display that can be stretched by up to 30 percent while operating as normal. As a proof of concept, engineers integrated this display into a stretchable heart rate monitor that can be stuck onto the skin like a Band-Aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHkTWZ"&gt;“The strength of this technology is that it allows you to measure your biometric data for a longer period without having to remove the solution when you sleep or exercise, since the patch feels like part of your skin,” Samsung’s Youngjun Yun said of the prototype technology in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “You can also check your biometric data right away on the screen without having to transfer it to an external device.” &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFyZiwadb4-DAZmLi4QNo3Q_hf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642438/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.48.03_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display is basic, with obvious pixels, but can be stretched by up to 30 percent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RRkuPZ"&gt;The display is rudimentary, but it worked as normal after being stretched 1,000 times, say Samsung’s engineers. The design of the heart rate monitor, sitting flush to the patient’s skin, allowed it to pick up a signal 2.4 times stronger than an ordinary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxxXRE"&gt;Although the technology is only in the early stages of development, Samsung suggests it could be used to support an array of health-monitoring systems in the future. “The technology can also be expanded to use in wearable healthcare products for adults, children and infants, as well as patients with certain diseases,” says Yun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZJ0M5"&gt;Details of the research have been &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/23/eabg9180"&gt;published in the journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89-E00tdamOdyXwmfZKV4Jqpd8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642437/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.47.50_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung / SAIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display works because of a grid-like “island” structure with stiff islands and more flexible channels. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k5k4OZ"&gt;The display can be stretched because it’s built from a specially designed flexible material known as elastomer. This elastomer has been treated to resist the heat of the integrated electronics by Samsung’s engineers and has a particular grid-like “island” structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdkwo2"&gt;The islands of elastomer are implanted with individual OLED pixels and are stiffer than the surrounding channels, while flexible electrodes are used to conduct the electricity. This bipartite structure allows “the spaces and wiring electrodes between the pixels to stretch and shrink without the OLED pixels themselves becoming deformed,” says Yun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chrFWQ"&gt;Don’t expect to see a new Stretchable Samsung Galaxy anytime soon (though the concept would fit nicely with theories of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe"&gt;expanding universe&lt;/a&gt;), as the screens built from this technology are too basic to be used for anything other than simple monitors. But in the future, tech like this could create wearable gadgets that are less rigid and more comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tj5MfC"&gt;If you’re interested in reading up on more of the science behind stretchable screens, &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum &lt;/em&gt;has a &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/portable-devices/from-foldable-phones-to-stretchy-screens"&gt;nice report on the topic&lt;/a&gt; from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme’s Snapdragon 888 flagship is coming to Europe for €549</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYh1l3fzhy2yIG2J3EXm4y37NM4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415712/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_21.24.24.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XG4nos"&gt;The Realme GT, Realme’s Snapdragon 888-equipped flagship phone, is coming to Europe and will sell for €549 (about $670) for a model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, according to the company’s website. The price makes it among the cheapest Snapdragon 888 devices available to date, if not the cheapest. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s excellent-value Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; started at €749 (~$910) for an 8GB / 128GB model, for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpCLLp"&gt;Realme says the GT will ship to Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal, though the device isn’t currently available to actually order. It’s not clear which other European markets it’ll be available in when it does launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFcnwT"&gt;Realme &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the Chinese version of the GT in March. It started at 2,799 yuan there for the 8GB / 128GB model, or about $440 at current exchange rates. Madhav Sheth, CEO of Realme’s Indian and European business, confirmed last week that the GT would get a global launch — a performance-focused flagship model in June and a camera-focused flagship model in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qrS15Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The GT series will be a part of realme’s new flagship focusing on high-performance and image, respectively. This will not only allow us to achieve technological breakthroughs but will also keep us ahead of the market.&lt;/p&gt;— Madhav Max 5G (@MadhavSheth1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MadhavSheth1/status/1400384292191019015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afs0gL"&gt;It’s not quite clear yet how those models will differ in Europe spec-wise, but the Chinese version of the GT had a 64-megapixel primary camera with an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro sensor, so there’s certainly room for improvement on the camera flagship. Elsewhere, the GT has a 6.43-inch 120Hz OLED display, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUU1IZ"&gt;Realme started out as a sub-brand of Oppo focused on the Indian market but quickly turned into a major force in its own right and is now focusing on capturing Europe with more premium devices. The launch of the GT follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270219/realme-x3-superzoom-uk-spain-launch-price-specs"&gt;last year’s €499 X3 Superzoom&lt;/a&gt;, which had a Snapdragon 855+ and a periscope telephoto lens. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Apple’s WWDC 2021 keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TY3YFSwdDg8PRWKubp9wWyHzERY=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415491/Apple_WWDC21_details_announcement_052421_big.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x8dZAy"&gt;Apple’s hosting its second &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22320961/apple-wwdc-2021-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos"&gt;all-virtual Worldwide Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; this year, and it seems like the company plans to squeeze in even more hardware announcements alongside its usual software updates. WWDC 2021 will run all week long, but things start off with the traditional Apple keynote on June 7th at 10AM PT / 1PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pWF5s"&gt;Apple is expected to try to win back professional users at WWDC by leaning in with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;a new more powerful M2 chip and a redesigned MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; that ditches maligned features like the Touch Bar and brings back the HDMI port and MagSafe. The new M2 is rumored to have double the processor and GPU cores, and it might not even be Apple’s top-of-the-line: the company is rumored to launch a more powerful iMac and Mac Pro sometime later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isgRfL"&gt;WWDC 2021 may bring some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"&gt;equally big changes to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. iPads might finally get an updated homescreen with fully customizable widgets, after years of mostly looking like a blown-up iPhone. Both operating systems are also rumored to get a new privacy menu for viewing the data apps use, notification settings that can be set around a user’s status (like if they’re driving or sleeping), and possibly a big update to iMessage and the Messages app that will make the service more of a social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjn9le"&gt;That’s a whole lot to talk about, even ignoring minor changes to macOS, tvOS, and watchOS, but the company will be hosting developer sessions throughout the week to get into all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES WWDC 2021 START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;It starts at 1PM ET / 10AM PT / 6PM BST. Following the keynote, developer sessions will be available to watch online for free through June 11th via the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/"&gt;Apple Developer website&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958"&gt;Apple Developer app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH WWDC 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos will fly to the edge of space with his brother next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzMY9cuGZpO-OJyT1ue3a3m3OcU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415416/Blue_Origin_Jeff_Bezos_Pad.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7YPGI"&gt;Jeff Bezos is headed into space, and he’s taking his brother with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxWs6v"&gt;The Amazon CEO announced the news &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP0MSOqnYEo/"&gt;via a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; (below). In it, he says he and his brother Mark will be launching into space on July 20th aboard a rocket built by Bezos’ space company Blue Origin. The firm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420709/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-tickets-astronaut"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt; it would be targeting this date for a first crewed flight, but did not say that Bezos himself would be taking part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZWqlD"&gt;In the Instagram video, Bezos says that taking a journey into space has been a lifelong dream for him, and that it will be “meaningful” to have his brother along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vpC1Db"&gt;

&lt;p id="vyidVT"&gt;“You see the earth from space and it changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It’s one Earth,” says Bezos. “I want to go on this flight because it’s the thing I’ve wanted to do all my life. It’s an adventure. It’s a big deal for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdvY5W"&gt;The Bezos bros will be flying to the edge of space aboard Blue Origin’s reusable rocket New Shepard. The booster is topped by a gumdrop-shaped Crew Capsule with space for six passengers inside and large windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZE0KL"&gt;The rocket will blast off from the Earth, and once it reaches the Kármán line, 100 kilometers above sea level, the capsule will detach from the booster, allowing those inside to view the curvature of the earth and experience weightlessness. The booster and capsule will then land separately, with capsule landing in the West Texas desert with the help of parachutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x81Emp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbxbrBLIogc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HKm9cJ"&gt;In addition to Jeff and Mark Bezos, one seat on the flight will be claimed by the winning bidder of an ongoing online auction ongoing. The auction ends on June 12th and currently has a high bid of $2,800,000. It seems expensive, but forget about the experience of going to space: the winner will also have 10 minutes to bend the ear of the richest person on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EOVAZBTSxaXtdfoSJRMar_ds3hM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415337/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The return of the Angry God of ARPU&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bil1UH"&gt;As we await the beginning of Apple’s latest WWDC keynote and all of the new software products it will unveil, let’s talk about metaphors. Specifically, the metaphors we use to talk about Apple’s ecosystem. The go-to for years has been that it’s a “walled garden” — here’s Joanna Stern at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; making that case in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;literal walled garden&lt;/a&gt; — but I’m not sure that’s the best one anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IS0KpJ"&gt;It’s worth kicking around some different ways of describing Apple’s ecosystem in this moment because of the nature of keynotes — even online-only keynotes. Apple is the master of crafting narratives around its products that become an organizing principle for understanding what those products are. Those narratives aren’t intellectual exercises, they’re stories told to change how you feel about Apple and its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2Se0M"&gt;There’s nothing inherently nefarious about Apple telling a story about itself and its products, but right now there are more counter-narratives than there ever have been. Apple is facing antitrust scrutiny from governments around the world, from its Epic lawsuit, and from the very developers it is addressing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxbHLE"&gt;Having some metaphors in your back pocket is a good starting point to craft your own narrative rather than accepting any of the above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAVVct"&gt;Metaphors work because they let you adopt the things you know and feel about one thing and apply them to another thing. They help organize your thoughts and can inspire you to look at a device in a different way. Steve Jobs was a master of this way of thinking. Is a computer a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c"&gt;bicycle for the mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfJ3QxJYsw8"&gt;is it a truck&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;div id="w85Fbb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob_GX50Za6c?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Qjzsd6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfJ3QxJYsw8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utFTUU"&gt;The answer is, of course, it’s both and neither. Metaphors are never one to one — otherwise they’d be &lt;em&gt;definitions&lt;/em&gt;. (Sidenote: I invite you to consider whether “computer” is best thought of as a &lt;em&gt;metaphor&lt;/em&gt; instead of a &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; when you think about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;whether the iPad&lt;/a&gt; is a computer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FCAIz"&gt;So that “walled garden.” It is, first and foremost, a &lt;em&gt;garden&lt;/em&gt; — it is tended, beautiful, and calming. It’s very nice to be in Apple’s world. Most things work together in harmony, and it’s often hard to forget there’s a big, big world of apps and services outside those walls. You can very happily use an iPhone to do almost anything you’d want without ever downloading a third-party app. You’re protected in some ways by those walls and — especially on the iPhone — your privacy is in some ways ensured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAl8BK"&gt;It’s a good metaphor! But the destiny of all metaphors is to become cliché. Through use and familiarity, they lose their emotive and explanatory power. When I call Apple a walled garden, it’s likely you know exactly what I mean and have already had the rest of the discussion in your head. The metaphor has lost the ability to help us understand more than we think we know. So let’s  keep “walled garden” around, but think about the other metaphors we might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9BNC4"&gt;One is the “Apple Tax,” the 30 percent (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt; if you’re able to wrangle it) cut of every digital transaction Apple takes on the iPhone. It’s at the center of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit, another Supreme Court case facing Apple, Spotify’s complaint in the EU that has led to government action, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EzKxdE"&gt;Lots of people hate taxes, but they are meant to pay for valuable shared infrastructure. But then again, maybe Apple already covered those costs by selling iPhones, so the Apple Tax is egregiously high — or, if you prefer a different metaphor with legal overtones, maybe it’s &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/"&gt;rent-seeking&lt;/a&gt;. Something about calling Apple’s cut a “tax” strikes me as a little over the top; the 2021 equivalent of spelling Microsoft with a $ in place of the s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0SkDl"&gt;During the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, a new metaphor popped into my head and I can’t shake it. As I was looking at the emails that Apple executives were sending each other and reading their testimony during the trial, I kept thinking I’d seen this kind of behavior and even some of the justifications before. And so here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzuDZ9"&gt;Apple is a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EoeZAd"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CW38nS"&gt;I mean “carrier” as in cellular network carrier, as in Apple is Verizon or T-Mobile or (shudder) AT&amp;amp;T. Here’s how the metaphor works: The most important thing to any carrier is feeding the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11193086/verizon-att-carrier-crapware-revenue-trick-samsung-software"&gt;Angry God of ARPU&lt;/a&gt; (average revenue per user). That number must go up to please shareholders and pay executives, and the carriers have engaged in any number of shenanigans to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9aEAl"&gt;Carriers have forced pre-installed crapware on phones since the beginning of apps on phones, well before the iPhone. Examples are too numerous to count, but I’m talking about more than just pre-installed &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-style games. Users have always been encouraged by the design of the phone and the restrictions placed on the networks themselves to do things that make the carriers more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vyjve4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Carriers once dictated what smartphones were allowed to do. It’s happening again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PGEbJI"&gt;Verizon made &lt;a href="https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/verizon-how-much-do-you-charge-now/"&gt;data buttons designed to be clicked by accident so you’d be charged&lt;/a&gt;. Sprint &lt;a href="https://blog.chron.com/jkonthephone/2007/01/sprint-testing-daily-charge-for-phone-web-browsing/"&gt;charged a daily fee to users who had the gall to access the web directly instead of using its WAP data portal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3260771/ATT-facetime-3g-charges"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T famously blocked FaceTime&lt;/a&gt; from working on its network unless users paid for more expensive data plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyOMyt"&gt;Every carrier has required wholly unnecessary navigation apps to be pinned to the launcher. Verizon used to go even further, &lt;a href="https://gigaom.com/2009/07/17/verizon-please-stop-disabling-gps-in-smartphones-on-your-network/"&gt;literally disabling GPS on smartphones on its network&lt;/a&gt;. That way it could force users to use (and pay for) its own navigation app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffdvlv"&gt;All of this is egregious behavior that goes far beyond the practices Apple engages in on the iPhone, but the exercise of control in order to make more money is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3s7ma"&gt;Apple uses its absolute control of app distribution on iOS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;pressure developers into adding in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, creating more opportunities for the company to take a cut. And Apple freely puts notifications and advertisements for its own services on the iPhone while limiting what other apps are allowed to do. A prompt to sign up for an Apple Card here. Apple Music offer there. Arcade, Fitness Plus, Apple News Plus, an offer to get a warranty in the main Settings app. It’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When you have to reset all your iPhone settings it becomes painfully clear that Apple apps have a different set of rules than everybody else when it comes to allowing notifications by default. &lt;a href="https://t.co/C75anymrJw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/C75anymrJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1352795378119151621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="87hQST"&gt;I admit it’s not fair to say Apple is as bad today as the carriers were back in the day when it comes to squeezing dollars out of users or developers. Nor is it fair to argue that Apple’s forays into content with TV Plus are the equivalent of AT&amp;amp;T’s flailing efforts at merging a TV network with a cellular network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="humso2"&gt;It’s not fair, but the tune sounds familiar because the parallels strike a chord. And the bitter harmony that I hear is the stifling of innovation to maximize profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yB7tek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What businesses and opportunities are foreclosed by App Store policies?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9HBFI"&gt;Apple forces all apps selling digital goods of any kind to use its payment system and pay its cut. The arguments for why Apple thinks that is necessary are well-known. But the effects of that (and other) rules are that new and innovative business models simply aren’t possible. Instead of paid upgrades, developers must resort to subscriptions. The nascent market to pay creators directly on services like Twitter and Substack must account for Apple’s platform fees. Instead of game streaming apps, there is… well, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJlkGQ"&gt;Of all the rules of the Apple App Store, to me the most telling is the “anti-steering” rule that prevents app makers from even hinting that there might be alternate ways to pay for things without using Apple’s in-app purchase system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Spznf"&gt;Take Ring, the division of Amazon that sells smart home gadgets. Because of these anti-steering rules, it doesn’t allow you to sign up for a subscription in its iPhone app. Instead, you are directed to an &lt;a href="https://ring.com/mobile/free-trial-expired"&gt;informational webpage&lt;/a&gt;. But Apple’s rules extend even to that webpage, hosted on Ring’s own website. It contains no information about how much a subscription costs, no links to sign up, or any other actually useful information. To get around Apple’s rules, Ring instead has a video and a chat bot that will eventually tell you how to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wPY8TK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, the chat bot requires a few extra interactions before you get to a subscribe page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, the ways Ring tells you how to subscribe on iOS appear to be designed to get around automated review and maybe even light human review. Incredible!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5/ &lt;a href="https://t.co/67CDpl4nsB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/67CDpl4nsB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1401204093348052992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="424vBS"&gt;The most revealing moment of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial came perhaps at the end, when Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers grilled Apple CEO Tim Cook on its policy of refusing to let apps even acknowledge the existence of ways to pay for digital goods outside of Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Here’s Adi Robertson on that exchange&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8J9qbe"&gt;“If they wanted to go and get a cheaper Battle Pass or V-Bucks, and they don’t know they’ve got that option, what is the problem with Apple giving them that option?” she asked.&lt;br&gt;“If we allowed people to link out like that, &lt;strong&gt;we would in essence give up our total return on our [intellectual property],&lt;/strong&gt;” Cook said bluntly. Apple has talked repeatedly about the work it puts into maintaining the App Store and the iOS platform, and it’s accused companies like Epic of wanting a free ride.&lt;br&gt;Rogers made the opposite case. “The gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it’s almost as if they’re subsidizing everybody else,” she said.&lt;br&gt;Cook countered that Apple’s many free apps attracted a larger audience than developers could get on their own. “&lt;strong&gt;We need a return on our IP. We have 150,000 APIs that we create and maintain, and numerous developer tools, and the customer service piece of dealing with all these transactions&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K0UQEP"&gt;Cook later pointed out that by offering so many free apps on the App Store, it was bringing customers in for the paid apps as well. “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we’re doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there,” he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="U31T9r"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n80HmD"&gt;Before the iPhone, carriers could (and did) point to any number of smartphones and rightfully boast about the incredible things those phones enabled. The Blackberry, the Treo, the Moto Q, and more all did things that nobody would have thought possible just a few years before. But the carriers would take credit for them while at the same time making demands that kneecapped those phones’ capabilities. They used their monopoly on wireless customers to dictate phone design, software capabilities, and business models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUNvyi"&gt;The result was a series of great phones that were still less than they could have been. I don’t know if any of them could have become the iPhone, but I do know that it wasn’t even possible because they didn’t have the leverage to tell the carriers to leave them be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eTCrnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple broke carrier control — and kept it for itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oE6A9A"&gt;The great irony is that the only thing that broke the dam on innovation in mobile was the iPhone itself. Steve Jobs was able to tell Cingular (now AT&amp;amp;T) to just accept whatever he made, sight unseen — and that was a key reason why the iPhone was great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMLKlS"&gt;And by continuing to keep them from meddling, the iPhone kicked off a wave of mobile innovation that’s still crashing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JfuFxr"&gt;Given the opportunity again, I have no doubt that the carriers would find ways to exert control, feed the Angry God of ARPU, and thereby stifle innovation. But Apple effectively took that power away from them — but then kept it for itself. The question now is what Apple intends to do with that power.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube’s TikTok competitor Shorts will soon let users sample audio from any YouTube video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three screenshots showing the interface of YouTube Shorts in beta. One shows a video, another shows a carousel of videos on the YouTube app’s main screen, and the third shows a grid of videos using the same sound." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_cpu2snigYXwEY5qH8tACft-cE=/0x1:4332x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415312/youtube_shorts_beta.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zGM5zd"&gt;Being able to sample audio from other users’ videos is one of TikTok’s greatest strengths. It allows memes to percolate across the platform and lets users discover new content by watching videos with the same sound. Soon, YouTube will expand this feature in its TikTok competitor, Shorts, letting users sample sounds from &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; content uploaded to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLFHxU"&gt;YouTube officially announced this feature last month in a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/108706620/introducing-a-new-way-to-create-shorts-with-audio-from-across-youtube?"&gt;community support post&lt;/a&gt;, but tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it should now be available for the first time in new markets as part of the launch of Shorts in the UK, Canada, and a number of Latin American countries (including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela). The YouTube-sampling tool will then roll out to other Shorts markets including the US in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrXmlZ"&gt;Shorts users can already sample sounds from other Shorts videos (as well as from a library of licensed music). But this update will greatly expand the audio they have easy access to. The feature will funnel YouTube users into its Shorts feature via a new “Create” button in the mobile app. This will appear underneath videos next to the like and dislike buttons. Clicking it will give users the option to sample the video’s audio in Shorts. Shorts viewers will also be able to tap the audio in any video to head back to the original source in YouTube proper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tq9HhbgKPWeDKzNTNgJzbI484aA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642212/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.51.50_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorts videos sampling audio from YouTube will link back to the original source. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lk31t1"&gt;This feature will allow longform creators “to benefit by allowing the community to find something interesting in their video,” YouTube’s product lead for Shorts, Todd Sherman, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Shorts users can create something with the sample audio, he says, and the creators of the audio will “get perhaps inbound traffic or exposure from that. From the longform creator perspective I think a lot of folks are excited to have their things remixed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKtDsA"&gt;Not all creators are happy about this, though. After YouTubers noticed a new check-box in the settings for their video uploads that gives Shorts users access to their audio, many complained that this would let people “steal” their content. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=youtube+shorts+permissions"&gt;Search for &lt;/a&gt;“YouTube Shorts permissions” on YouTube itself and you’ll find plenty of videos worrying about exactly this scenario, with thumbnails posing questions like: “YouTube legalized video stealing?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQuKAw"&gt;The permissions box seems to have been introduced before Shorts users were actually able to sample audio from YouTube videos. Right now it has to be unticked manually for each video, but Sherman tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is working on a bulk opt-out option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wxwQAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;br&gt;YouTube suddenly automatically checked "Yes" on EVERY YouTube video to allow them to be re-uploaded as Shorts on OTHER channels ???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please let your YouTuber friends know that they have to go through and uncheck this setting on every video or risk stolen content... &lt;a href="https://t.co/b4rjiwmE2c"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b4rjiwmE2c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mysticat #Mysty200k (@MysticatLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MysticatLive/status/1388191677836414977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnPnbj"&gt;A YouTube-sampling feature could create other problems, too. A huge array of content has been uploaded to YouTube over the years, much of it sensitive or personal in nature. The uploaders of this content won’t necessarily want their videos to be sampled as this could enable harassment or abuse. Despite this, the sampling feature will be opt-out rather than opt-in. That means all YouTube videos will be sampleable by default, and creators will have to specify which videos they don’t want to be used in Shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE6PRN"&gt;Sherman says YouTube is aware of these potential problems, but that the company’s discussions with creators has indicated more excitement. “There is some concern about examples of videos that you might think are personal or sensitive and that’s why creators have asked for the ability to opt out. But they also seem to recognize that it sort of doesn’t work if it’s very selectively an opt-in,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zppWbr"&gt;YouTube originally launched Shorts last September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;in India&lt;/a&gt; before bringing the feature to the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286286/youtube-shorts-us-rollout-product-features-updates-chapters-monetization-neal-mohan"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;pay $100 million to creators&lt;/a&gt; to use the app, though exactly how much individual creators can earn isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First official images of Honor 50 look weirdly like Huawei’s P50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plOQ3XD0AxSEPiHDZ5RvXNmfK1A=/1x0:1231x820/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415268/E3RP8UBVgAAehBM.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1TvJra"&gt;Honor has released a couple of official images for its upcoming 50 series smartphone via its &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3206603957/Kj2gp1BMw?type=comment#_rnd1623057835464"&gt;Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. The images focus on the rear of the phone, showing an eye-catching pair of circular camera bumps. The Honor 50 series is currently due to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1399599535077220356"&gt;announced on June 16th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7ODi7"&gt;Amidst a sea of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/12/18663281/google-pixel-4-apple-iphone-11-ugly-square-phone-cameras-modules"&gt;square and rectangular camera bumps&lt;/a&gt;, the dual circle design is an interesting look for Honor’s next flagship. It’s also a style that Honor’s former parent company Huawei is planning to use for &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next flagship, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;the similarly-named P50&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible that the two companies finalized their designs before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;Huawei sold off Honor late last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’ll be strange to see such similar looking devices released from two distinct manufacturers within such close proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ZZGU2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Honor50series?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Honor50series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;100W Super Fast Charge&lt;br&gt;Hypercurved screen.                                                  Launching in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shanghai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, June 16th! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9MAzE0RsDb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9MAzE0RsDb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bhavya (Haya) (@bhavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bhavis/status/1401833284183621637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTJNMl"&gt;From the images it appears as though Honor’s next handset will have four rear cameras in total. The upper camera circle has one large lens, and it’s joined by three more on the lower bump. In contrast, Huawei’s P50 appears to have three lenses on the upper circle, and a single camera paired with a flash on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFDdLE"&gt;Beyond its design, Honor’s next flagship will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G processor, will feature 100W fast charging, and will also come with a “hypercurved screen.” It may also mark the return of Google’s apps and services to Honor’s devices (including the Google Play Store) if a &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-50-google-apps/"&gt;now-deleted tweet from the company’s German Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. Honor was prevented from including Google’s software because of sanctions placed on its former parent company Huawei, but these are believed to not apply since it became independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y406pk"&gt;A spokesperson from Honor previously declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; as to whether or not Google’s software would be available on the upcoming 50 series. But with an official launch just round the corner, we won’t have long to wait to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rshhL7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell sued over Alienware laptop’s ‘unprecedented upgradeability’ claims  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2B8CTsRHo__qyLPbTzqx6wxQJg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415192/vpavic_190102_3148_0136.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B1ikxe"&gt;Dell is being sued in California over its claims that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167444/alienware-area-51m-desktop-laptop-features-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;Alienware Area-51m R1 laptop&lt;/a&gt; would offer “unprecedented upgradeability,” &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dell-hit-with-fraud-case-over-alienware-area-51m-upgrade-claims"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Alienware customer Robert Felter is accusing the company of running a “false and misleading” marketing campaign, in which it promised that the laptop’s core components, including the CPU and GPU, could be swapped out for more powerful models. A year later, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256786/alienware-area-gaming-laptops-dell-spec-boost-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Area-51m R1’s successor was announced&lt;/a&gt; with new components not available as upgrades for the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBaXH"&gt;“Consumers were misled by Dell’s false and misleading marketing campaign and paid a significant premium for the Area 51M R1 under the incorrect belief that this ‘unprecedented upgradeability’ would save them money in the long run by allowing them to upgrade their laptop’s Core Components rather than having to purchase an entirely new upgraded laptop,” the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gR5mMS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers were misled by Dell’s false and misleading marketing campaign”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TwhOJ"&gt;Dell announced the Alienware Area 51-m R1 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167444/alienware-area-51m-desktop-laptop-features-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;at CES 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The laptop offered a variety of 8th and 9th Gen Intel CPU options (including the i7-8700, i7-9700K, or i9-9900K processors) and graphics cards including Nvidia’s RTX 2070 and 2080. However, when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256786/alienware-area-gaming-laptops-dell-spec-boost-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Area-51m R2&lt;/a&gt; was announced the following May, it offered 10th Gen Intel CPUs and new GPUs including the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;not available as upgrades&lt;/a&gt; for the R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhUIwm"&gt;If you go back and look at the specific promises Dell made when it announced the original laptop, it doesn’t seem to have &lt;em&gt;technically &lt;/em&gt;broken any of them. It said the laptop would only support Intel CPUs that used its Z390 chipset, which was compatible with the 8th and 9th-generation processors in the original R1 laptop. However, when Dell announced the R2, the new 10th-generation Intel CPUs used a new 400-series chipset. Considering it was Intel’s decision to change its chipset, this decision was arguably out of Dell’s hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vedrmJ"&gt;Meanwhile, when it comes to upgrades for the laptop’s graphics card, Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time of the R1’s announcement that it’d “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.” Effectively, customers could upgrade a lower end version of the laptop to a higher-end model, but only within the same generation of components. That left customers who bought the top-end model out of luck when a new generation of components rolled around.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell’s marketing promised “unprecedented upgradeability” for the laptop. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aGDDNm"&gt;The suit alleges that Dell should have been aware that Intel and Nvidia’s unannounced products wouldn’t work with the laptop. It claims Dell works closely with both companies, and that it should know the specs of their products prior to them becoming public. “Yet, despite being in possession of such designs, and with the full knowledge that the design of the Area 51M R1 could not accommodate future NVIDIA and INTEL chipsets, Dell launched a global campaign to mislead the public that the Area 51M R1 was upgradeable,” it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQLslY"&gt;The question now is whether that means Dell’s claims about “unprecedented upgradeability” (which are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/area-51m-r1/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop?AID=8900246&amp;amp;cjevent=d7a6593bc76011eb821a014e0a180512&amp;amp;cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXwxNjA2ODI1MDcwOTk1&amp;amp;gacd=9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103&amp;amp;dgc=af&amp;amp;VEN1=12839518-8900246-tomshardware-gb-1382540981155333000-Future%20Publishing%20Limited&amp;amp;dclid=CM2a8YP-hPECFYVmGwod6g8JJw&amp;amp;nclid=sCnLdWKocO4tlIbByYhQWxGscbEIKLu2GjmkogdKVjrVGC0eNRCJWg4hSIUGJ4t1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still live&lt;/a&gt; on its website) were misleading. “Dell’s advertisement to the public didn’t place any restrictions on the upgradeability of the laptop,” Felter’s lawyer David W. Kani told &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;. “They also never disclosed that those with the highest spec CPU and/or GPU that their device would not be upgradeable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGQR2Y"&gt;Dell declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; on the lawsuit, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In the filing, Felter is seeking damages, relief, and attorneys fees for himself and other affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple apparently has a spatial audio event right after today’s WWDC keynote</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbWUnT"&gt;Apple appears to have planned a dedicated event on Apple Music’s upcoming spatial audio feature for later today. According to a video that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/06/apple-music-event-june7-after-wwdc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; was uploaded to &lt;em&gt;Apple Music &lt;/em&gt;as a teaser&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;it’s since been removed — Apple will broadcast a special event called “Introducing Spatial Audio.” The event doesn’t appear on the Worldwide Developers Conference schedule but is set for 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzXx0I"&gt;That is, of course, immediately after the presumed conclusion of Apple’s much anticipated 1PM ET keynote to kick off this year’s online WWDC, where the company is expected to announce its annual updates to each of its operating systems. Later in the afternoon at 5PM ET Apple will give its usual “State of the Union” presentation, which is more focused on developers than the opening keynote and addresses various technical aspects of the company’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xvwrXDo5W-2ZX2-IMMxKqj_xOTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642181/apple_music_june_7_post.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwhGpC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; spatial audio for Apple Music last month alongside the addition of lossless files to the streaming service. Spatial audio will work with AirPods, built-in speakers on Apple devices, and third-party headphones, and should provide more immersive Dolby Atmos mixes compared to regular stereo audio. Apple previously said the feature would launch in June, so a mention of the release date at the WWDC keynote wouldn’t have been surprising, but it seems the company wants to give it a little more time in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="323wVv"&gt;For more on what to expect at WWDC today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;here’s our preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk tweets that Tesla’s Plaid Plus is ‘canceled’ because ‘Plaid is just so good’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JXGNVgE7v_bajt3ryy3xTyzXiUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69414090/twarren_08202017_1939_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyiy13"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Sunday that the automaker’s Model S Plaid Plus is “canceled,” since the basic Plaid is “just so good.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TE9jpr"&gt;Tesla has been teasing its Model S Plaid since 2019, and Musk said late last month that delivery for the vehicle — which  will have top speeds of 200 mph and range between 390 and 412 miles— would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed to June 10th&lt;/a&gt; as it needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KafvAo"&gt;He also tweeted Sunday that the Plaid could go from zero to 60 mph in under two seconds (a statement he’s made previously). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPivSE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1401642134583791624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hzqrw"&gt;The Plaid Plus was supposed to have range of more than 520 miles, but its specs on Tesla’s website Sunday are greyed out, although the site still says “Plaid Plus available in mid-2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw-AFk5o2g1eEu9_jbLAncACJYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641300/plaid_greyed_out.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tesla/screencap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Plaid Plus doesn’t appear to be an option on Tesla’s website&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vezkBI"&gt;The Plaid Model S made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at Laguna Seca raceway in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, where it lapped the course in 1 minute and 36 seconds. Tesla later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;showed off the Model S Plaid as part of its Battery Day presentation&lt;/a&gt; in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1EVDN"&gt;While it’s possible Musk was joking on Twitter about the Plaid Plus being canceled (maybe to boost confidence in the regular Plaid model?) it seems unlikely, since he’s already tangled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295240/elon-musk-sec-tweets-judge-nyc-ruling"&gt;past tweets&lt;/a&gt; about Tesla business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1B6pr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4fPW1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
