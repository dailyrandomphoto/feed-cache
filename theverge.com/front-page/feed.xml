    <title>Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbbYm9BW2d8T3Sci6WY-D-0rDNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014429/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHsQSA"&gt;Intel has a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and he’s not wasting any time to make some big changes. At the company’s “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries, a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona, and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjyEy6"&gt;The new announcements are part of a new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel’s design and manufacturing, which is made up of three parts. First, Intel’s own in-house manufacturing, which will continue to serve a key part of Intel’s design and production of chips. Second is an expanded use of external foundries, including TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries,  including for production of “products at the core of Intel’s computing offerings” for both consumer and enterprise chips, starting in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nFYd5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt; A new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WabTaD"&gt;And third is the newly announced Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel open its gates to handle manufacturing of chips for other commercial customers, led by &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/randhir-thakur/"&gt;Dr. Randhir Thakur&lt;/a&gt;. Intel Foundry Services is a “standalone foundry business unit,” and will develop x86, ARM, and RISC-V core chips for external clients using Intel’s manufacturing technology. And crucially for government work, Intel’s foundries will be located in the US and Europe, a benefit that competitors like TSMC don’t have. Partners include IBM, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn23vc"&gt;The expansion of Intel’s manufacturing efforts — which include a $20 billion investment into new fabs in Arizona that will expand Intel’s existing Ocotillo campus — come at a critical time: the ongoing global semiconductor shortage means that demand for chips is at an all-time high. Adding Intel’s foundries (and its new Foundry Services business) could help open up new avenues for companies to source the chips that are essential for everything from new video game consoles to new pickup trucks. Gelsinger also teased that more foundries are in the works, promising additional announcements of expansions in the US, Europe, and elsewhere in the world later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff7Vt3"&gt;Intel also announced a new R&amp;amp;D collaboration with IBM “focused on creating next–generation logic and packaging technologies.” Details are slim at the moment, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFI1NR"&gt;Lastly, Intel announced plans to bring back a spiritual successor to its Intel Developer Forum conference with a new Intel Innovation event planned for October in San Francisco this fall as part of a new Intel On series of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS24uV"&gt;Intel stands at a critical junction right now: the company faces increased competition from companies like AMD and Apple’s ARM-based M1 series of chips. At the same time, it’s seen major shifts in leadership and delays of generations of its chips, all while being outpaced by competitors like TSMC in terms of production techniques. Today’s announcements represent Gelsinger’s first big moves to try to right the ship. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon names former exec Adam Selipsky as the new head of AWS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_fKTgOIGhVdxJVmh4mdEozBjQQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014323/1183490734.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ACSqlm"&gt;Amazon has named Salesforce executive Adam Selipsky as the replacement for Andy Jassy, the longtime chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the company’s next CEO when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;founder Jeff Bezos steps down later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Selipsky worked at AWS for more than 10 years before running the startup Tableau, which is now part of Salesforce. The news was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/amazon-taps-former-executive-adam-selipsky-to-run-aws.html"&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, which published the memo Jassy sent to Amazon employees on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ra39a"&gt;“Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well,” Jassy wrote in the memo. Selipsky joined Salesforce when the cloud computing giant acquired Tableau in a monstrous $15.7 billion deal in 2019. Selipsky has been part of Salesforce’s executive leadership team since as Tableau’s acting CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gjMCAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="skUkn2"&gt;There was speculation as to whether Amazon would promote an existing AWS executive to take over Jassy’s role. Eyes were on Matt Garman, who was promoted to the top sales role last year, and Peter DeSantis, the general manager of AWS’s EC2 business, as potential candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqOguK"&gt;Ultimately, it looks like Jassy turned to a former colleague — and someone with a pretty stunning track record helping to push a midsized software company toward a $15 billion acquisition — as the top choice for his replacement to run AWS. Selipsky will rejoin Amazon in May, when he and Jassy will be “transitioning together” into their new roles in the lead-up to Bezos’ move to executive chairman of the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJqZVZ"&gt;“With a $51B revenue run rate that’s growing 28% YoY (these were the Q4 2020 numbers we last publicly shared), it’s easy to forget that AWS is still in the very early stages of what’s possible,” Jassy wrote in the memo, referencing the less than 5 percent of global IT spend occurring in the cloud computing market. “We have a lot more to invent for customers, and we have a very strong leadership team and group of builders to go make it happen.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom now has an SDK for putting Zoom into other things</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits at a desk using a desktop computer. Emanating from the computer, connected with dotted lines, are a play icon, a picture of mountains, a map icon, and a weather icon." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAQSsaUFWUR8yRl_RJOaV3sX_tk=/192x0:1629x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014311/Video_SDK_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjiSEC"&gt;Zoom has released a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers build Zoom into their software. According to the company, you can now build your own “video-based applications and websites” on top of Zoom’s platform and can more easily incorporate Zoom’s video and audio features directly into your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxucl1"&gt;The company envisions developers utilizing Zoom’s chat functions in a number of different settings, from social media and gaming platforms to virtual retail apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8lnbH"&gt;“Using our Video SDK, developers can drive customer engagement and provide new opportunities for revenue without being tied to the Zoom Meetings user interface,” writes Zoom product marketing manager Natalie Mullin in a &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/bring-industry-leading-video-to-your-application-with-zooms-video-sdk/"&gt;company blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jw0h5J"&gt;The SDK is part of a broader push to get Zoom’s tools into developers’ hands. The company is also rolling out a &lt;a href="http://developers.zoom.us/"&gt;centralized portal&lt;/a&gt; where developers can learn about and access available developer tools. “We want to be able to have a single point where developers can go to learn about all of the tools and resources that are available for them in the Zoom platform for their work in development,” Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s a new analytics dashboard where developers can monitor how their users are interacting with the new Zoom features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNHCf1"&gt;Zoom has had to significantly scale up its operations since COVID-19 led to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home"&gt;increase in remote work&lt;/a&gt; and remote learning early last year. The company says it added an “unprecedented number of free participants” in the first few months of the pandemic alone. It’s consistently added new tools to keep pace with competitors like Google Meet, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;expanded accessibility features&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273217/zoom-studio-special-effects-meeting-mustache-eyebrows-lips"&gt;facial effects&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570302/zoom-security-temporarily-shut-down-suspend-meetings-stop-zoombombers"&gt;security improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will make you savor two of its reality shows with a weekly release schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDVhxAbTU8uxm-1_6IbLVDfCj5c=/222x0:1848x1084/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014156/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_1.11.38_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ei4fT0"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-circle-and-too-hot-to-handle-return-this-spring"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be experimenting with the release schedules of two reality TV shows, &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/circle-too-hot-to-handle-modified-release-netflix"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of releasing all of the episodes at once, it will release them over the course of a month, with each show having a batch of episodes released on Wednesdays, then releasing the finale by itself at the end of the run. This means you won’t be able to binge all of the episodes in a single weekend... and that may be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mW3XY"&gt;These shows aren’t the first time Netflix has broken away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453220/netflix-arrested-development-return-television-landscape"&gt;the binge model it popularized&lt;/a&gt;, in which all of the episodes of a show are released at once. It has released episodes of cooking competition &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;music contest &lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Flow &lt;/em&gt;on a weekly basis. With&lt;em&gt; The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, though, Netflix is making a statement that it’s experimenting and trying to give people time to “dissect and dish” the events of the show. In other words, it’s giving people time to gossip about what happened and what could happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OXqKem"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaW6N"&gt;There is a benefit to having people talking about your show for a month, rather than only for a weekend. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039496/the-witchers-success-netflix-binge-watch-release-strategy-game-of-thrones-mandolorian-weekly"&gt;arguably ran into this problem with &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the show’s writing seeming better suited to weekly viewing rather than an eight-hour marathon. That’s especially true for a reality show like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor,&lt;/em&gt; with drama ratcheting up until a big finale. That’s the type of thing you’d want to keep people talking about — and maybe subscribing to your service to see what all the fuss is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brcW0L"&gt;That’s the type of effect Netflix could be trying to replicate. Reality TV lends itself especially well to a slow burn, keeping the internet buzz alive. Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21203686/tiger-king-netflix-meme-tiktok-twitter-live-tv-coronavirus-viral"&gt;instead of all at once&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt; probably won’t become cultural touchstones like &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;did, there is a chance the release schedule will let them become bigger than they would’ve if we had all watched them over a weekend and then moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AymYXB"&gt;I’m not trying to say that Netflix will (or should) switch to the weekly release model for its future narrative shows. Yes, Disney was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188654/mandalorian-episodes-finale-release-time-spoilers-game-of-thrones"&gt;very successful using that model with&lt;em&gt; The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, but those shows also had a lot going for them, and Netflix has a history of successfully releasing narrative shows all at once: the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046412/netflix-witcher-henry-cavill-games-books-fandom-binge-ip-competitors"&gt;was still well-received&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;was an inescapable cultural force for a while there. It’s also worth noting that narrative shows and reality TV are very different formats, and it could make sense to have different release plans for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ukvslx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Circle &lt;/em&gt;is a game show about being isolated in an apartment and using only social media to connect with others (weirdly prescient for a show &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(British_TV_series)"&gt;that first aired in 2018&lt;/a&gt;), and it will start showing on April 14th, with the finale releasing on May 5th. It seems like Netflix is planning a similar release schedule for &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, a show where people try to date each other without any PDA, but the company hasn’t released exact details about it yet, other than a release window of “June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTpTVt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You probably haven’t used Yahoo in a while, but what if it cost you money?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3heApRjmByH4d25O6ZmLDtcsO_o=/109x0:1729x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013874/1616443602945.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon Media Group&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SbGYfH"&gt;Yahoo is the legacy Web 1.0 brand that just won’t get dragged and dropped into the trash bin of history, and that’s largely thanks to Verizon’s tireless efforts to keep it going after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269898/verizon-acquires-yahoo-4-billion-marissa-mayer"&gt;buying the company a few years ago for nearly $5 billion&lt;/a&gt;. This time around, the telecom giant actually wants to &lt;em&gt;expand&lt;/em&gt; the Yahoo brand to all of its consumer-facing web properties with a new series of subscription offerings organized around what it’s calling Yahoo Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-media-subscription-yahoo-plus-05a8abb3-d871-4870-8bba-161a394e8cf1.html"&gt;according to a new report from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA85FF"&gt;It’s important to mention right now, before we go any further, that the official Verizon Media Group branding provided for Yahoo Plus stylizes it as “Yahoo!+,” with that deranged cousin of the interrobang slapped onto the end of it. Apparently “Oath,” which was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064172/verizon-oath-media-group-rebrand"&gt;previous incarnation of Verizon Media Group&lt;/a&gt; and technically the division that swallowed Yahoo after the acquisition, was not the end of the company’s poor naming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4dzrC"&gt;If Yahoo Plus (we’re going to drop the exclamation point and the plus sign) sounds like a streaming service, you’re right. It certainly does, but it’s not. Yahoo Plus will instead be a kind of hybrid media portfolio of various Yahoo products and services, including its finance platform; its very-much-still-alive email platform; its media properties, including &lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch;&lt;/em&gt; and its fantasy sports service, among others. But in all seriousness, there is a sizable business here: Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; it already has 3 million existing customers  of subscription products it offers across services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpkVOt"&gt;In some cases, customers of Yahoo Plus will pay for extra premium features, while in others — like the &lt;a href="https://payments.mail.yahoo.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwo-aCBhC-ARIsAAkNQivyRx3IKbEi-yYRii-RPxoqHMlTQXzQ6J8KlojcR5isdVyu98kUGH4aAsenEALw_wcB&amp;amp;ncid=dcm_271619786_465330143_130623920"&gt;existing subscription version of Yahoo Mail&lt;/a&gt; called Yahoo Mail Pro — you’ll pay to remove ads, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports. We don’t know how Verizon plans to bundle this as Yahoo Plus, or whether it will charge for each one separately and how much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbemIq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is “Yahoo!+” better than “go90”? The jury is still out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KjfBQ3"&gt;The bigger picture here is that Verizon is acknowledging a hard reality after the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/verizon-takes-46-billion-write-down-for-media-unit-that-ncludes-aol-yahoo-1544556371-0c9f6649-7b9b-4d17-861e-4302ab6b477a.html"&gt;write-down of its entire media business&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 (just a year after the Yahoo deal closed) and the unceremonious end of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17516266/verizon-shutting-down-go90-original-video-content-app"&gt;unsuccessful proto-Quibi streaming app go90&lt;/a&gt;. And that is that the whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15180622/oath-aol-yahoo-verizon-ad-tracking-privacy"&gt;targeted advertising play it was hoping to pull off&lt;/a&gt; by combining its telecom analytics, AOL, Yahoo, and its various other corporate tentacles is simply not equipped to take on the Facebook-Google duopoly in online advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu3k4V"&gt;So Verizon is now trying subscription models. Those are certainly all the rage in media these days. After all, collecting recurring direct payments from consumers is the only surefire way to inject any stability in an ad market largely dominated by Big Tech and susceptible to cataclysmic downturns, like &lt;a href="https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/global-ad-market-will-take-years-to-recover-from-covid-19/44417"&gt;what happened last year when the COVID-19 pandemic set in&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWYLmC"&gt;That brings us back to Yahoo Plus. While it may seem silly to continue leaning on the brand perhaps best known for signaling an email address that’s remained unchanged since high school, the Yahoo brand is admittedly resilient and about as close to a household name in websites as you can get outside the major Silicon Valley corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjG1rN"&gt;”Yahoo is the future of our consumer facing brand,” Joanna Lambert, Verizon Media’s consumer chief, told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;. “From a strategy perspective, we have enormous scale that is unlike most media companies in the world. The question becomes, ‘how do we take that audience and drive them from being free users to subscribers of really valuable paid offerings?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJFx0"&gt;Lambert is right about the massive scale of Yahoo properties — they’re still among the biggest on the web. And if Verizon can somehow pull off a series of subscription services that actually complement its ad business, then it’ll have truly breathed new life into the Yahoo name. We’re just still a little unsure on the whole “Yahoo!+” thing. Let’s hope it rethinks that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow and Cruella are now coming to Disney Plus at the same time as theaters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mq0ULJXnu8tDEvk73OtVVISRQ3Q=/0x31:1096x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013349/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_2.40.36_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IbU69i"&gt;Disney is &lt;a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-media-and-entertainment-distribution-announces-updates-to-summer-film-release-schedule"&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; two of its biggest 2021 releases to streaming: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; are now set to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as $30 Premiere Access titles alongside their theatrical releases. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed an additional two months: it’ll now debut in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 9th, instead of the previous May 7th release date. (&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; is still set to release on May 28th.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5106iu"&gt;Additionally, Disney announced further changes to its schedule: Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; will now be skipping theaters entirely (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;similar to last year’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and will release on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for all subscribers with no additional fee on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ft3OgF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Black Widow in theaters July 9 and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; with Premier Access. Additional fees required. &lt;a href="https://t.co/MSLHxk6Eez"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MSLHxk6Eez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1374429041877389320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2LBlW"&gt;Alongside the new release plan for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, Disney also announced new theatrical dates for several other major 2021 films. Notably, Ryan Reynolds’ &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; will now hit theaters on August 13th, and &lt;em&gt;Kingsman&lt;/em&gt; prequel &lt;em&gt;The King’s Man&lt;/em&gt; will hit on December 22nd. &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt; and Agatha Christie adaptation &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile &lt;/em&gt;have been pushed to 2022, hitting theaters on January 14th and February 11th, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMJo4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;’s delay is a particularly notable one. Originally slated to hit theaters on May 1st, 2020, it has been delayed multiple times over the past year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic’s shuttering of cinemas. And while Disney has repeatedly said that it was still hoping to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; in theaters — with the potentially $1 billion-plus box office numbers that Marvel films tend to bring in — it seems the sluggish speed of reopening theaters has forced it to consider a simultaneous streaming debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSMGmh"&gt;And while the delay to July means that Disney will have a better shot at maximizing its box office returns (the film will still be released on the big screen for those willing to brave theaters), the interconnectedness of Marvel’s sprawling film — and now, streaming show — universe means the company can only delay new entries for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvkRu2"&gt;Each change means reshuffling the entire Marvel release schedule. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, &lt;/em&gt;for example, is set to hit theaters on September 3rd now that &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has taken its July date. But there are also storytelling concerns: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is all but guaranteed to tie into the upcoming &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1019713/9358?subId1=VergeBlackWidowCruella032321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; show (which is planned for later in 2021), which means delaying the movie could also set back Disney’s streaming shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lH9Dvv"&gt;The unprecedented move by Disney to shift such prominent releases to Disney Plus also emphasized how important the streaming service is to the company’s future. As CEO Bob Chapek commented when the service hit its 100 million subscriber milestone earlier this year, Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1ccHX"&gt;The decision to release &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; — like &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; before them — will help give Disney a better idea of what premium home streaming will look like going forward. And while theaters will certainly be a big part of Disney’s future release plans, one only needs to look at things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ ongoing HBO Max release experiment&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;increasingly short length&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;theatrical windows&lt;/a&gt; to see how important streaming releases will be to the future of cinema. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Half-Life: Alyx is 40 percent off for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx screenshot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTNtZiC8_h3b1Y7K_EHXSpkp4ss=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013330/COMBINE_ELEVATOR_4K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4U7ijG"&gt;Valve is celebrating the anniversary of its launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by offering the best price yet on the VR-exclusive game at Steam. Normally $60 (and worth every penny), you can &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"&gt;snag it for $36&lt;/a&gt;, totaling a 40 percent discount that lasts until Wednesday, March 31st. If you’re looking for a new VR game to sink your teeth into, this is worth playing for many reasons. If the fact that is serves as the prequel to &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt; isn’t enough for you, it’s the total package for a VR game, with a fantastic narrative and graphics and immersive gameplay that makes a VR headset worth owning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WAclrA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10408507"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f5SHDF"&gt;Valve still gives away free copies of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; to people who purchase its Index VR headset, but this is a good deal for everyone else. This game requires a hearty gaming PC to get the most out of it, but thankfully, you no longer &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to use a wired VR headset to experience the game (though that remains the easiest option). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNyMER"&gt;If you own the Oculus Quest or Quest 2, you can purchase the Virtual Desktop app from the Oculus store, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;which allows you to stream the game from your PC to the headset&lt;/a&gt; via Wi-Fi. The app is an extra $20 on top of this game’s cost, but it’s a cheap way to get a roomscale-ready VR headset that, when connected to your PC wirelessly, can play any PC VR game you have installed — &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; included. And in my opinion, it’s so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lina Khan is just the first step toward tougher US tech regulation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pwkcpz_OHD5jfCePOn4K1YkAaSg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013141/acastro_170711_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kIGNoR"&gt;President Joe Biden picked one of tech’s most ardent critics, Lina Khan, to join the Federal Trade Commission on Monday. For Democrats and progressives, Khan’s nomination was a sign that the Biden administration may be the toughest one in history when it comes to tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vs6QPN"&gt;“We need all hands on deck as we work to take on some of the biggest monopolies in the world, and President Biden is making his commitment to competition clear,” Senate antitrust committee leader Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRlOY0"&gt;Even White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said to expect more tech scrutiny from Biden earlier this year. “The president has been clear — on the campaign, and, probably, more recently — that he stands up to the abuse of power, and that includes the abuse of power from big technology companies and their executives,” Psaki said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cHx6HH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Khan and other anti-tech progressives will be working against decades of inertia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg3IWE"&gt;But even if optimism is high for the incoming FTC, Khan and other anti-tech progressives will be working against decades of inertia. Khan would only be one vote on a commission of five with a tattered history of sorry settlements and deals with companies like Facebook and Google. Over the years, antitrust enforcers have been starved of the resources necessary for taking on complicated and lengthy competition cases, and there are real concerns about whether the FTC will have the resources or legal authority to take on Big Tech, no matter who’s at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv3PhU"&gt;With Khan replacing Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, Biden has one more seat to fill before Democrats have a 3-2 majority at the agency and can begin filing suits or making settlements. For the interim, Acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter is leading the FTC, but Biden hasn’t announced who he’ll officially nominate to lead the agency. It’s unclear if Biden’s FTC chair will be as skeptical of tech’s market power as Khan and Slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyEgEh"&gt;Before being nominated to the FTC, Khan burst onto the antitrust scene after publishing a legal paper called the “Amazon Antitrust Paradox.” It became immediately popular with tech critics. Shortly after, Khan worked as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee’s 16-month probe into giant tech firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. That investigation produced a 400-page report from Democrats calling for new laws to better help law enforcement agencies like the FTC take on antitrust cases against tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMLANe"&gt;“My strategy is you’ll see a number of bills introduced, both because it’s harder for (the tech companies) to manage and oppose, you know, 10 bills as opposed to one,” House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee chair Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8bgUX"&gt;That work is still beginning, but the House has signaled that it plans to introduce legislation that would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338763/facebook-google-antitrust-cicilline-ftc-slaughter-monopoly"&gt;beef up the FTC later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Republicans and Democrats agree on &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/congress-tech-antitrust-agenda-30a7bcc7-22ee-4897-93ec-99f6aaf577d4.html"&gt;a handful of measures&lt;/a&gt; to help the FTC take on tech. These proposals range from legislating more funding for enforcers to pay for lengthy legal battles against wealthy tech companies. &lt;a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/its-ridiculous-underfunded-us-regulators"&gt;As Alex Kantrowitz wrote in &lt;em&gt;Big Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last year, the FTC’s budget is less than $350 million a year, while Facebook makes billions every quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ6L6U"&gt;Lawmakers have also proposed changing &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-unveils-sweeping-antitrust-bill-laying-out-her-vision-as-new-subcommittee-chair-.html"&gt;the burden of proof&lt;/a&gt; for proposed mergers so that large companies would have to prove that their acquisitions aren’t anti-competitive before they’re allowed to finalize them. This would put more of the onus on huge tech firms when they decide to buy up a nascent company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7phaHX"&gt;The FTC isn’t the only agency with the authority to challenge tech monopolies. Earlier this month, the Senate confirmed Merrick Garland as US attorney general. When Garland was first nominated in January, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/big-tech-faces-a-formidable-opponent-in-merrick-garland-as-ag-190800859.html"&gt;experts pointed to his antitrust experience&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that he would crack down on Big Tech. Still, Biden has yet to nominate anyone to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/biden-big-tech-antitrust-renata-hesse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that two attorneys who previously advised tech companies were in the running for the role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WSQ1"&gt;Biden still has a lot of work to do before his administration truly pivots away from the Silicon Valley coziness of the Obama administration. But if the White House and Congress get to work, the FTC could pose a significant and immediate threat to the growing power of Big Tech.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Black Shark 4 is a high-end gaming phone that doesn’t look like one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGL_i_mPrY1EJJPr0AAesrtdPfg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69013017/blackshark4lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Shark&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b0JyVN"&gt;Xiaomi’s Black Shark brand has announced its fourth series of gaming phones, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro. They improve on the previous series in most of the ways you’d expect them to. There’s a faster processor, moving up to the Snapdragon 870 in the standard Black Shark 4 and the Snapdragon 888 in the 4 Pro. Both phones also come with fast LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 storage, though each will come in different configurations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRMexn"&gt;The Black Shark 4 starts with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for 2,499 Chinese yuan (roughly $383), while the 4 Pro starts at 3,999 yuan (about $613) and has 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. These will debut in China on Friday, March 26th, while the company says an overseas launch will happen “in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Black Shark 4" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9_Mx00wD3oxIHN5IALpYcuXk53Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391953/blackshark4sidebyside.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESP2tF"&gt;As is almost a given in the realm of gaming phones, Black Shark has leap-frogged Asus and RedMagic — some of its biggest competition in the niche gaming phone space — when it comes to touch sampling rate or how many times the display can register a touch. Both the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have a 720Hz touch sampling rate with a 8.3ms touch delay, which it claims to be an industry best. This spec likely won’t make a difference in most people’s day-to-day usage of these phones, but some hardcore gamers might care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLrvVy"&gt;Both phones have the mechanical shoulder buttons introduced in the previous Black Shark phones, though the company claims it has improved their look and feel with “magnetic power lift” tech, making them feel more tactile to click, as well as fitting more seamlessly into the phone’s design. Speaking on the look of these new phones, they’re decidedly more attractive than the previous models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6jLWEc3wGctuQNIizIKHw8NDRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16333859/jbareham_190611_3481_0177.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Black Shark 2, which introduced the pressure-sensitive display that lets you map two functions to one spot on the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRWYlT"&gt;In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;I really liked in the Black Shark 2&lt;/a&gt;. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWJFBm"&gt;Unlike last year’s model, the Black Shark 4 and 4 Pro have displays that are the same size. They both have 6.67-inch OLED screens with a 144Hz refresh rate. Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that I recently reviewed, these phones have dual front-facing speakers with claims that they have good spatial audio separation. Also like that Asus phone, Black Shark announced that a fan accessory called the FunCooler 2 Pro can be attached to keep it cooler. The price for that is 199 yuan (about $30).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXz4q7"&gt;If you’ve watched even just an episode of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know this: Grogu is always hungry. The little guy, previously known as Baby Yoda, is constantly snacking, whether it’s on endangered frog eggs or newly spawned spider monsters. Sometimes, he just needs a nice cup of bone broth to tide him over. And soon there will be an animatronic toy to match his appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7Or18VtAUsqBySAQtxporT4qN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22391912/STAR_WARS_GALACTIC_SNACKIN__GROGU___oop__6_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN3GUS"&gt;Today, Hasbro announced &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/galactic-snackin-grogu"&gt;Galactic Snackin’ Grogu&lt;/a&gt; — that’s the product’s actual name — which will release in October for $79.99. You can feed him with a spoon, let him munch on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21612698/mandalorian-cookie-macarons-the-child-williams-sonoma-star-wars-price"&gt;some strange blue cookies&lt;/a&gt;, or just give him a bowl of live squid. Given his propensity to eat anything, even if it gets him in trouble, the limited options are probably a good thing. Hasbro says that lil’ Grogu will let you know when he likes something or “what belongs in a trash compactor.” He’s also got some force powers and can levitate his favorite toy that he stole from the Mandalorian’s ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccq2Wu"&gt;This is actually the second animatronic Grogu, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/2/21/21146913/baby-yoda-animatronic-toy-hasbro-release-date-price-mandalorian-star-wars-disney"&gt;one last year that could coo and fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;. Hasbro’s senior design director Vickie Stratford says that when it came to creating a follow-up, “the concept of snacking opened up many fun ideas for our design and development team to create an all-new interactive experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KjH59"&gt;Hasbro says the toy will be available to preorder today at “most major retailers.”&lt;/p&gt;
