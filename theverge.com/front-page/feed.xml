    <title>Reuters finally decides to charge you for its online news stories with a paywall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQKNI8"&gt;As online publishers grapple with how to replace dwindling ad revenue and find new ways to bring in money, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, one of the largest news organizations in the world, is using a strategy that’s been around for years and putting its online content behind a paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBNpzP"&gt;Reuters.com draws 41 million unique visitors monthly, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/reuters-website-goes-behind-paywall-new-strategy-2021-04-15/"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, but it has not charged for access like other news sites in its business-centric niche have done for some time. It will let users read five stories a month for free and plans to charge $34.99 a month for a subscription. That’s a bit pricier than a sub to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; ($18.42 / month) but closer to similar news organizations of its type, including &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; ($38.99 / month), which put its paywall up in 1996, and Bloomberg.com ($34.99 / month), which added a paywall in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Xwz5z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; said it generates half of its revenue from its largest client, the financial data firm Refinitiv, and also makes money from online advertising. The company says it has redesigned its website with a “professional audience” in mind and plans investment in segments like legal news and live streams of its events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuIC5A"&gt;How online news is paid for has been the topic of discussion among publishers for years; online advertising doesn’t bring in the level of revenue that print ads used to for newspapers, and publishers often have to rely on platforms like Facebook and Google to push their content to readers. Google has battled with lawmakers in Australia who want the search giant to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;pay publishers for their content&lt;/a&gt;. And amid renewed scrutiny of social media platforms and how they siphon ad revenue from news publishers, a bill &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bill-aid-us-publishers-google-facebook-rises-76605745"&gt;introduced last month in Congress&lt;/a&gt; aims to give more leverage to publishers when negotiating with platforms for a share of ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5nggI"&gt;While both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276544/google-news-showcase-uk-argentina-launch-license-paywall-content"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have initiatives that pay some publishers to license their content, for many news outlets online subscriptions are a major part of their revenue streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWXdkd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arcade Fire released an epic 45-minute single — in Headspace’s meditation app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 Life Is Beautiful Festival - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UT8NRn0mD5SlQLaPw6TWaoPBMAc=/0x39:3000x2039/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132982/1039320710.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pdwbRQ"&gt;Arcade Fire has a new single out — sort of. The Canadian indie rock band has released a new 45-minute instrumental composition called “Memories In The Age Of Anxiety,” but the new song is actually a collaboration with meditation app Headspace, and you can only listen to it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCudSP"&gt;The new track was created in collaboration with John Legend and, as &lt;a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2144197/arcade-fire-release-new-45-minute-song-for-meditation-app/music/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stereogum&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the first new pieces of music from the group since its cover of “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpYOstfcQBs"&gt;Baby Mine&lt;/a&gt;” in the 2019 live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Dumbo.&lt;/em&gt; (It’s the band’s first original song since its 2017 studio album &lt;em&gt;Everything Now.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHZXZx"&gt;Unfortunately for frugal Arcade Fire fans, it’s &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;locked behind a paywall in Headspace as part of the app’s Headspace Plus subscription, which costs $12.99 per month or $69.99 per year. You can listen to a snippet in the group’s Instagram post announcing the collaboration, which gives a mere glimpse of the soaring synthesizers and pulsing beats that Arcade Fire&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is known for. But if you want to hear the whole thing, you’ll have to pay up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Spring Loaded event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RQfy_HJ-uLurWi5D4Bl4HGm8yKI=/34x0:1759x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132951/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_8.22.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT on April 20th&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="imUhUH"&gt;Spring has sprung and with it, the first Apple event of the year. The company successfully brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21552864/apple-event-macbook-arm-air-announcements-news-rumors-one-more-thing"&gt;custom Arm chips to its Macs&lt;/a&gt; last year, and now it’s continuing its product updates with an event called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22310826/apple-april-20th-event-date-rumors-ipad-pro-macbook-tv-airtags"&gt;Spring Loaded&lt;/a&gt;.” Outside the obvious coiled metal connotation, the name suggests another jam-packed day of announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2PTIT"&gt;And Apple does have a lot of products to address. The Apple TV was last updated in 2017 but is rumored to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz displays&lt;/a&gt;, a new processor that could make it a more capable Apple Arcade machine, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;a redesigned remote&lt;/a&gt;. The iPad mini is also expected to finally receive some love after sitting idle since 2019. Reports point to a larger display and updated internals for the small tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I22HdR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336917/apple-new-ipad-pros-mini-base-april"&gt;New iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt; will reportedly get a speed boost with a new chip similar to Apple’s M1, a Thunderbolt port for faster transfers and compatibility with more devices, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279247/apple-ipad-pro-2021-5g-qualcomm-mini-led-a14x"&gt;support for 5G&lt;/a&gt;. The larger 12.9-inch Pro may also be the first Apple device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;to feature a Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379337/new-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issues-date-report"&gt;a display and component shortage&lt;/a&gt; could limit how many tablets Apple is able to produce and sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvkD5I"&gt;There’s plenty of other hanging threads, too: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;the long-rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could show up, Apple may have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375738/apple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows"&gt;new podcast strategy&lt;/a&gt;, the Apple Pencil could get a redesign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534123/apple-airpods-3-pro-2-2021-chip-design-battery-life-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-homepod"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt; could make an appearance, the MacBook Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;might finally get its ports back&lt;/a&gt;, and there are always plenty of opportunities for surprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCEZQ"&gt;We’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here with everything Apple announces.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s own ads reveal: not many people are using Facebook Dating</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VddfSOh6JtkgsncqAa_gpW7USUM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132440/VRG_ILLO_4530_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It says 278,000 singles are on it in New York City&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4CenqX"&gt;Dawn Hallson has tried nearly every dating app you can think of — Tinder, Bumble, eHarmony, Plenty of Fish, and Match, just to name a few. So when a friend told her about Facebook Dating, she figured, why not give it a shot? She filled out her height, whether she has kids, where she lives, and her sexual orientation, and then looked around at who might be available on the world’s largest social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYmjwn"&gt;“It was exactly the same as all the other apps,” she says. “You match with someone. They don’t contact you. If they do contact you, they just pass the time of day with you — never much with anyone that’s attractive unless they actually want just sex, basically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PURwC4"&gt;She only met up with one person from Facebook Dating, which fizzled out when he tried to hook up on the first date. After that, she quit. She lasted about six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ou4Wpg"&gt;Facebook first introduced its dating product as a test in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17871690/facebook-dating-release-colombia-test"&gt;Colombia in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and brought it Stateside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20850307/facebook-dating-united-states-launch"&gt;in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the company hasn’t said much. The last time dating was talked about at length on an earnings call was right after it launched. In that call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he thought it was “already one of the top dating services, and we expect to continue growing.” In a release &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/facebook-dating-expands-to-europe/"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; its international expansion to Europe this past October, the company said it had made over 1.5 billion matches up until that point. Tinder, meanwhile, advertises “over 55 billion matches made” &lt;a href="https://tinder.com/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUTjv7"&gt;But a year and a half after launch, Facebook Dating is far from a hit. The company hasn’t shared overall usage numbers, and data found by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; suggests the app is smaller than competing options. The company only shares data when it wants to, and because the service lives within the broader Facebook app, there’s no way to measure download numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM8Gfq"&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has found multiple screenshots that suggest the actual size of Facebook’s dating product isn’t all that large but that it’s growing. The company runs in-house ads that advertise the number of users it has in specific regions. In the country’s largest city, New York, for example, the company advertised 278,000 singles “currently dating” in the city this week. In Indianapolis &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peachlancia/status/1371617543719415810?s=20"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, it advertised 43,000 people, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sardonyc_AP/status/1379535126917492739?s=20"&gt;in Ottawa, Canada&lt;/a&gt;, earlier this month, it claimed to have 24,000. Users in smaller cities also see hyper-localized data. In Bellingham, Washington, Facebook &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abknickel/status/1382495553318096896?s=20"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it has 2,000 single people using it. Days after its launch in Ireland, Facebook &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KateOLoughlinx/status/1321071303865126912?s=20"&gt;advertised&lt;/a&gt; having 1,000 people on the service in Dublin. The numbers appear to be dynamic and adjusting, too. Just last week, the same in-house ad in New York City advertised around 2,000 fewer people, and a month ago, it showed 9,000 fewer, suggesting these in-feed ads are successfully signing up new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PPDq8g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Who needs Facebook dating when you get told "God called upon me to tell me that he wants me to take you as my wife" from random LDS &amp;amp; Polygamists about 2x a month in the grocery store?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook is becoming more irrelevant everyday lmfao &lt;a href="https://t.co/dhTC07BAck"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dhTC07BAck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— denali (@degandhi_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/degandhi_/status/1372912186947817482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xFCbi4"&gt;Census data estimates &lt;a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US3651000-new-york-ny/"&gt;from 2019&lt;/a&gt; suggest that nearly 4 million unmarried people call New York City home, meaning Facebook Dating has about 7 percent of the city’s singles on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTBhdM"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Match Group spokesperson said, “We have a number of brands with more active users than that in NYC, including Tinder and Hinge.” They wouldn’t elaborate on numbers. In its latest earnings, however, Match Group &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/MTCH-4Q-2020-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the average number of &lt;em&gt;paying &lt;/em&gt;subscribers across its apps last quarter reached 10.9 million split about equally between North America and the rest of the world — let alone the number of people using its apps for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOr9RH"&gt;This advertised Facebook data poses a variety of questions, though. For one, are these users active, or just the total number who have signed up? For places like New York City, does the number only count people who live in the five boroughs, or does it include neighboring places like Westchester County, New York, and Jersey City, New Jersey? And how wide are the demographics of these users? If all users tend to be in one age group, another age group likely won’t have a good experience using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUMb2w"&gt;In response to these questions, a Facebook spokesperson sent a statement over email saying that the platform is designed to help people find “meaningful relationships” and that they’re “excited about how it’s performing and the feedback we’ve been getting from people who have found love through the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WQ6y37"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i couldn’t think of anything worse than facebook dating &lt;a href="https://t.co/HuBjipPeHg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HuBjipPeHg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— liv •        (@liv_liv_liv__) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liv_liv_liv__/status/1371176145341853707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S7PcI8"&gt;So if Facebook’s dating feature isn’t massive, why keep it around? Zuckerberg suggested during its January 2020 earnings call that Facebook Dating could eventually become a driving force for why people return to the app and engage with it. In the year and a half since its rollout in the States, Facebook Dating has now made its way to other parts of the world, including, most recently, to 32 European countries in addition to the 20 it’s already in. The company also appears to have a deeper interest in augmenting the dating experience. Just this week, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature"&gt;an experimental Facebook app called Sparked&lt;/a&gt;, which sets users up on four-minute video speed dates. If Facebook Dating itself isn’t the eventual successful product, maybe there will be other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSV0AY"&gt;Analysts like Daniel Salmon at BMO Capital Markets are mostly concerned with Facebook revenue, though. Because the company hasn’t built advertising into Dating or started charging for add-on functionality, the feature isn’t at a point where Salmon sees it as a meaningful part of the business. That could easily change, however, depending on how many people start forking over their data in order to meet the love of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tS7o9H"&gt;“Any data that Facebook is getting on their audience enriches their profiles for ad targeting anywhere across their portfolios,” he says. “Any engagement is good engagement because any engagement creates data, and that can be used to improve the ad platform, even if you don’t have ads sitting there in front of people who are looking for dates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BFjdV5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Idk why but I get infuriated every time Facebook Dating tries to recruit me. Let me be lonely on my own! &lt;a href="https://t.co/3AF0yiEejg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3AF0yiEejg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NoHo Hank (@ColorblindCrocs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ColorblindCrocs/status/1331385636885041152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pkQS5c"&gt;Although Facebook doesn’t, so far, ask specific prying questions a la OkCupid and other dating apps, it still asks for some information. It wants to know people’s heights, whether they have children, who they’re looking to date, and where they live. The app also asks for photos that can be uploaded to the profile. Plus, conversations can be pushed &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/facebook-to-launch-virtual-dating-over-messenger/"&gt;over to Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, giving Facebook &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/04/app-privacy-labels-messaging-apps/"&gt;way more data&lt;/a&gt;, including the images that are sent there, the precise location of the sender, their contacts, and their browsing history. (The company’s initial rollout to Europe was even stalled because Ireland’s Data Protection Commission “&lt;a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/dpc-statement-facebook-dating-feature"&gt;conducted an inspection&lt;/a&gt;” at Facebook’s Dublin offices and “gathered documentation” to learn more about the company’s intended data practices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaMcbs"&gt;Dating gives people who let their data become stagnant and might have stopped uploading photos to the app a reason to update, and Facebook gains better insight into how to target ads, which is the ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYmMI2"&gt;The company might never be forthcoming about how its dating efforts are going, but its ambitions are relatively clear. So long as it can get people to keep coming back to Facebook, whether it’s to see friends or find love, a product pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PH88vA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story initially said Daniel Salmon worked at BMO Group. The name is actually BMO Capital Markets. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feels is a new dating app trying to ditch swiping for Stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gv7XSJ9qhB0QFGb2S21BJdWC5DY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69132072/ezgif.com_gif_maker__10_.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You scroll through people’s profiles, similar to a TikTok feed.&lt;/em&gt; | Video: Feels&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALfRpo"&gt;There’s a new dating app on the scene called &lt;a href="https://www.feels-app.com/"&gt;Feels&lt;/a&gt;. Its unique selling point is an interface that feels closer to a Snapchat-style story or a TikTok feed rather than the swipeable cards found in other dating apps. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/feels-is-a-new-dating-app-with-profiles-that-look-more-personal/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; Feels currently has around 100,000 users. Although the app is available globally, the company says its focus is primarily on the French market as it launches more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKi7zV"&gt;Feels is styling itself as an “anti-dating app,” but to be clear, &lt;em&gt;this is very much still a dating app&lt;/em&gt;. You’re still reacting to profiles and having conversations, which, I’m sure, for a lot of people, will end up with them going on dates. At the same time, though, Feels’ interface, ahem, &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; different enough from the competition to make it interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJxIct4CLj2c5Zw3a974RuhldKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446531/IMG_0607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Feels&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add captions and location tags to your photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rc1lb3"&gt;Profiles are made up of a combination of pictures, videos, and answers to prewritten questions (similar to Hinge), but each element fills up your whole screen, and you browse through a profile by tapping on the left or right sides of the screen. Like I said, it’s very Snapchat Stories. They’re the same elements that rival dating apps have used before but wrapped up in a more modern interface. It’s promising, if a little lacking in customization options beyond adding captions and locations to your photos and videos (though the company tells me stickers are being added in the near future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPzblU"&gt;Feels is also making a big deal out of not relying on the same swiping gestures as other dating apps (a change we think is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21004916/tinder-bumble-okcupid-swipe-decade-online-dating-match-change"&gt;long overdue&lt;/a&gt;), but the distinction is a bit academic. You’re ultimately still swiping through profiles; the animation is just a little different. And you also can’t swipe back to a previous profile without paying for a premium subscription, which also adds other features like a profile visibility boost. As of this writing, this costs a somewhat expensive $9.49 / €9.99 / £8.49 a week (though there are discounts for paying monthly). &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;notes the company is still iterating on its premium plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6Z1ty"&gt;But a dating app is only as good as the people on it, and within a few minutes, I’d swiped (ahem, I’m sorry, &lt;em&gt;scrolled&lt;/em&gt;) through the mere dozen or so accounts of users registered in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OY1Nx"&gt;It’s early days for Feels, and it’s launching into a very crowded market. Established competitors like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge have added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;pandemic-focused dating features&lt;/a&gt; to help singles date with social distancing and lockdowns, while Facebook has recently shown a renewed interest in the area with tests of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381511/facebook-video-speed-dating-npe-team-sparked-feature"&gt;new speed dating app called Sparked&lt;/a&gt;. But with more users and profile customization options, Feels could be an interesting new dating app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pXNYU"&gt;Feels is currently &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/feels-too-cool-to-match/id1455618069"&gt;live on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the company tells me it’s working to bring its Android app back to the Google Play Store after being kicked off yesterday. (Feels CEO Daniel Cheaib tells me the team has yet to discover why its listing was removed.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI Stealth 15M review: thin doesn’t always win</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A supremely lightweight 15.6-inch gaming laptop that puts form slightly too far ahead of function&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="80PAtr"&gt;MSI’s Stealth 15M is a gaming laptop for people who’d prefer to keep their gaming habit a secret. The metal design looks striking, and, aside from the single-zone RGB backlit keyboard, there isn’t much else about the 15M that’ll give away what you’re probably using it for — aside from its loud fans. Unless you’re running the simplest tasks on battery saver mode, its fans are almost always audibly whirring, and the whining only gets louder with demanding applications and games. You might not notice it if you wear headphones or a headset most of the time, but others around you probably will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LklO9o"&gt;It can be noisy because it’s always warm and trying to keep cool. A thin laptop crammed with powerful components can lead to higher temperatures, especially during gaming. It has an aluminum chassis that helps to diffuse some of that heat, but it still can become uncomfortably warm to touch at times, despite its fans’ best (and loudest) efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbu8cI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10447863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iiP6vQ"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI’s GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; is going for the jugular of Razer’s high-end Blade 15 Advanced, the Stealth 15M aims to take on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; model that I recently reviewed. And it’s the closest that MSI has come to meeting Razer where it excels with build quality, design, and port selection. Unlike the GS66, the 15M has a more cohesive-feeling build that doesn’t make me question its durability over time, and it is shockingly thin for a gaming laptop. Yet, for as much as I complained that Razer’s unibody design needs a shake-up, its $1,699 option simply offers more for your money. You’ll get more ports (including an HDMI 2.1 port for 4K output at up to 120 frames per second), a larger trackpad, user-upgradeable RAM and storage, and more power allocated to its RTX 3060 than you’ll get in MSI’s similarly priced Stealth 15M. The Blade 15 Base is almost a full pound heavier and a few millimeters thicker. But I wouldn’t let those traits alone stand in my way if I was getting ready to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LmMIkzTr-LXQ_Hynv436P5gJ_GY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430771/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stealth 15M comes in this “carbon gray” colorway or white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWj5x6X5hnFwgL8XJydSZ3EYsSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430772/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grille is one of the few edgier parts of the design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="arIXqt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10447865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kldsG1"&gt;But that’s not your only option in this price range. You’ll get great performance in a similar price range with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; that has an Nvidia RTX 3070 and a QHD screen. But if you have the luxury of time to wait until early May, it’s worth seeing how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368010/dell-g15-amd-ryzen-edition-15-inch-gaming-laptop-release-date-price-specs"&gt;Dell’s $900 G15 Ryzen Edition with the RTX 3060 will fare&lt;/a&gt;. Dell’s option is bigger, thicker, and likely heavier (though Dell hasn’t shared the official weight) than any of these thin gaming laptops, but there’s a big upside: it’ll be just $900 for the starting configuration. Conversely, MSI’s laptop has more constraints on its power, yet those limitations help it look and feel like a high-end laptop that you can lug around more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqfWZY"&gt;For gaming alone, the Stealth 15M isn’t powerful enough to recommend to everyone. It can reach the ideal 60 frames per second threshold with some demanding titles that I threw at it, but it wasn’t particularly smooth until I made a few minor compromises to the visual quality. Likely because of the Stealth 15M’s thin design, MSI set the maximum power draw of the RTX 3060 inside of it to just 65W, which is almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;the lowest-possible power requirement the spec allows&lt;/a&gt;. (The slightly thicker Predator Triton 300 SE is at 75W, but the aforementioned G15 Ryzen Edition coming in May runs at 115W.) Performance will be good enough for some people, but unless you play older or less demanding games than the ones I tested below, you won’t take full advantage of the 144Hz refresh rate matte display that MSI put in this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95nT3C"&gt;Running &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; on the 15M with the 3060 yields around 57 frames per second with the graphics set to ultra settings. In another open-world game, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll get around 68 frames per second with settings set to their maximum. For a test of the RTX 3060’s ray-tracing capabilities, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with DLSS and ray-tracing shadows set to ultra ran at 57 frames per second. Gaming pushes the 15M to the edge, as its loud fans indicate every step of the way. I didn’t notice any apparent bottlenecks in performance due to the heat, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ltvvjL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10447852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G07l6t"&gt;If you’re comparing these numbers to some of our other reviews, you probably noticed how similarly this laptop performed to the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Asus TUF Dash F15&lt;/a&gt; that has an RTX 3070. That’s due to their similar clock speed and wattage requirements. It’s encouraging that the RTX 3060 can keep up, but I’m skeptical that it’ll be able to maintain pace over the next few years, as games become even more graphically demanding to run. Even if some RTX 3070 and 3080 chips run at similar clock speeds and similar wattages as an RTX 3060 right now, they’ll always have more CUDA cores and VRAM to spare, which should give them a sturdier backbone to weather next-gen games in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbZUEQ"&gt;This high-end configuration (which MSI says is available at Costco) comes with the quad-core Intel Core i7-11375H processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3060, just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347032/acer-predator-triton-300-se-review-price-features-specs"&gt;Acer’s 14-inch Predator Triton 300 SE&lt;/a&gt;. The big advantages internally, aside from its bigger 15.6-inch FHD screen, are its 32GB of RAM and 1TB of NVMe storage. It’s more than enough for handling basic tasks like browsing the web, and I didn’t catch it chugging with a myriad of Chrome tabs running. Doing other everyday tasks like hopping into a Zoom call, using Slack, and running Spotify worked as well as they should (and the speakers are better than ones I’ve heard in most gaming laptops recently but are still not particularly great). All said, the moment-to-moment use of the Stealth 15M feels similarly speedy to that of other laptops in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AbxeT9itpD2q_cuXSLBO926jcdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430777/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t the world’s biggest chin bezel, but it’s still somewhat of an eyesore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M2JLvhu87f1Ev2uTJUgHf6yIVk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430773/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys are big and nicely spaced out, though the layout might take some time to learn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6y6KK"&gt;Everything from games to videos look great on this matte display. It has generous viewing angles, thin bezels, and the colors look accurate. I wish its bottom chin wasn’t as thick. Perhaps MSI could have managed to fit in a 16:10 aspect ratio display, given how large it is. The webcam has an indicator light that flashes on and off endlessly when it’s active instead of just remaining lit, like most other laptops do. At least you’ll never accidentally forget that the camera is on, but it is annoying if you’re not the forgetful type. I’ve reached out to MSI to find out whether this is a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgCJNy"&gt;The keyboard layout might take some getting used to (every laptop seems to have a different idea of where to put the function key and how to arrange the volume and screen brightness keys), but the keys themselves are big and nicely spaced out, with a satisfying amount of key travel. The trackpad works well, but I would have liked to see MSI stick its almost comically large trackpad found in both the GS66 Stealth and Prestige 14 Evo in here. There’s room here, so why not? I would have also welcomed the fingerprint sensor built into the Prestige 14 Evo’s trackpad.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui5jq4"&gt;The Stealth 15M won’t pass as the thin ultrabook that the Prestige 14 Evo is, but it’s still surprisingly thin for passing as a gaming laptop. The 15M is 16mm thick (its closest competition, the Razer Blade 15 Base, is about 19mm), and it weighs 3.7 pounds. This makes it one of the lightest 15.6-inch gaming laptops I’ve had the opportunity to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zOrGh"&gt;The selection of ports around the 15M includes one Thunderbolt 4 port with power delivery (PD) support for recharging other devices (but not the laptop itself) and another USB-C port that supports connecting to an external display. All configurations also include a UHS-III microSD card slot, two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one audio combo jack, and an HDMI 2.0 port with support for up 4K resolution at 60Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/euOufNiGyCL6q6ADMtglJaMN--w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430770/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the laptop’s right side, you’ll find a USB-C port with DisplayPort, a Thunderbolt 4 port, USB Type-A, and an HDMI 2.0 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI Stealth 15M" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQdWL5IibBJXeFHK24BqL2IKm4g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22430769/cfaulkner_20210405_4508_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The left side features a charging port, a microSD card slot, USB Type-A, and an audio combo jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nAthPz"&gt;As for longevity, the Stealth 15M’s three-cell 52Wh battery is good for a handful of hours with moderately intensive use. With one hour-long Zoom call tossed into the mix of some otherwise normal Chrome and Slack usage, it lasted about four and a half hours. If all you’re doing is typing, I could imagine it lasting for close to six. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O74xy8"&gt;MSI includes a slim 150W power brick that’s a little smaller in the length and width department than my Pixel 3, but it’s about as thick as three of them stacked. It’s considerably smaller than the bricks included with more powerful gaming laptops, but this one had no trouble keeping the 15M’s battery topped up while gaming. That can be a problem with some models, which sometimes come paired with a power adapter that can’t keep enough wattage going in to match what’s being spent by the hardware during gaming. Additionally, this 150W charger recharges the 15M quickly, taking just about an hour and fifteen minutes during my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIBr1P"&gt;The Stealth 15M is a well-designed laptop without many glaring issues, but for the price of this configuration (and even the less costly ones, which are still fairly costly), you won’t be getting a ton of bang for your buck if you’re a gamer who wants great performance. MSI went with a thinner, more subtle design than some other gaming laptop designs, and that’s one of the best things about the Stealth 15M. But if you’re eager to spend this much on a gaming laptop, either spend a few hundred more to get one that has a QHD screen with a better GPU or wait until Dell’s more affordable G15 Ryzen Edition releases in May.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus now allows developers to sell subscriptions to their Quest apps and games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rec Room Plus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9IN_iOWTPlE-OP0SSJhH8p6Oy0=/0x0:1933x1289/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131595/recroomplus.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rec Room is a popular VR app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSEMwU"&gt;Developers who have apps or games on the Oculus Store can now sell recurring subscriptions to their titles, as opposed to offering them for a one-time fee or choosing to handle the subscription process independently. This should give developers an easier, more sustainable way to offer new content, features, and tools to paid subscribers over time. Oculus told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the approval process for apps with subscriptions is similar to apps that have in-app purchases and add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIgSNu"&gt;Oculus &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fdiscover-premium-content-with-subscriptions-on-the-oculus-quest-platform%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shared on its blog&lt;/a&gt; that starting today, &lt;em&gt;FitXR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350421/rec-room-teenagers-gaming-users-pandemic-virtual-reality"&gt;the hugely successful &lt;em&gt;Rec Room&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tribe XR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tripp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;vSpatial&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;VZfit &lt;/em&gt;are the first to begin operating on a subscription model in the Oculus Store — specifically, for the Quest platform versions of the apps. If you’ve purchased or downloaded any of these apps, you’ll keep whatever content you already have access to. Check out the blog for specifics on how each app will handle the jump to the subscription model and what perks each will offer, as they differ. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus Store" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8B7n11eFI4B_VdIPVb6EvlJbjzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446334/oculusstoresub.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll see this “Free” button popping up more often in the store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wz6pBo"&gt;Popular VR fitness app &lt;em&gt;Supernatural &lt;/em&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will soon bring support for in-headset subscriptions for new members in the near future, but for now, subscriptions are handled through its site or mobile companion app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yjcI3"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14170896/htc-viveport-app-subscription-service-announced"&gt;HTC’s Xbox Game Pass-like Viveport service&lt;/a&gt; that offers unlimited access to a library of VR apps and games for a monthly or annual cost, the Oculus Store is sticking with per-app subscriptions for now. And don’t worry, Oculus will allow a free trial period for every subscription-based title on the store, so you can try (and cancel) before you buy, but those trial periods vary per app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j5On44"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nilay Patel interviews Supernatural founder Chris Milk on the future of fitness in VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22379859/vr-virtual-reality-fitness-work-out-supernatural-chris-milk-interview"},{"title":"The best games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="peEbq9"&gt;Oculus says some apps will now require a subscription to use them at all, while some will make subscribing optional. Though, it’s likely that developers will funnel most new content to subscribers instead of offering it as a free update, as popular Quest games like &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;In Death: Unchained&lt;/em&gt; have done with downloadable content packs, perhaps as a way to encourage in-app spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LqdI9"&gt;The VR company owned by Facebook &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Ffrom-bear-to-bull-how-oculus-quest-2-is-changing-the-game-for-vr%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stated in February&lt;/a&gt; that over 60 titles for the Quest platform are making millions of dollars with apps and games on the Oculus Store. It clearly wants to turn more apps into million-dollar stories, and subscriptions certainly seem like a way to accelerate that. When I asked if Oculus will retain a percentage of a subscription sale, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it doesn’t discuss fees it collects from developers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bezos says Amazon workers aren’t treated like robots, unveils robotic plan to keep them working</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bezos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eXTdjHdx4jW98MgWPk9XpMlGoSM=/0x0:400x267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131508/bezos-square.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uU5Mw6"&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in his &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3ah2C7w"&gt;final letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; as CEO that the e-commerce giant has to “do a better job for our employees.” The letter comes amid ongoing reports of untenable conditions for Amazon workers. And it outlines a strategy that seems odd for a company that has been accused of treating workers like robots: a robotic scheme that will develop new staffing schedules using an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v70U3m"&gt;Bezos pushed back on the idea that, according to news reports, Amazon doesn’t care for its employees. “In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qof4z7"&gt;To address concerns about working conditions, Bezos said the company will develop new staffing schedules “that use sophisticated algorithms to rotate employees among jobs that use different muscle-tendon groups to decrease repetitive motion and help protect employees from MSD risks.” The technology will roll out throughout 2021, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxUJIA"&gt;In addition to giving a nod to working conditions at Amazon, the letter is the first time Bezos has publicly addressed the failed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;union drive at its Bessemer, Alabama plant&lt;/a&gt;. “Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t,” Bezos wrote. “I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better &lt;em&gt;vision&lt;/em&gt; for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBgvu6"&gt;Amazon issued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;a rare public apology&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;was caught publicly lying&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) that its workers have not ever had to pee in water bottles to meet their work demands. This is &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;a well-documented issue at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;how it robotically tracks and fires&lt;/a&gt; workers. An Amazon worker &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as recently as late March that bathroom breaks (or the lack of) were still a problem. “You’re sitting there and you have to go take a piss, but you don’t want to rack up ‘time off task,’” the worker said. In addition, Amazon is facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;a lawsuit over workers’ missed lunch breaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7akVHn"&gt;Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union that led the Bessemer unionization drive, said in a statement Thursday that the impact of the union drive, regardless of the outcome, has been “devastating” for Amazon’s reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiaM2q"&gt;“We have initiated a global debate about the way Amazon treats its employees,” Appelbaum wrote. “Bezos’s admission today demonstrates that what we have been saying about workplace conditions is correct. But his admission won’t change anything, workers need a union &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; not just another Amazon public relations effort in damage control.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game studio layoffs mean a hellish race against the clock for immigrant developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQVxgs9v2dEnXkN5_uvSA2sp4D4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131452/acastro_210415_4534_gameDevVisas_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;When losing a job becomes a deportation risk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VG8x6Y"&gt;The layoffs happened suddenly. One day, Jose Abalos was employed, working on &lt;em&gt;Disney Infinity 4&lt;/em&gt;. The next day, he was not. “It was something that upended everything, everything, all kinds of security,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Everything just went belly-up in a single day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8Gzd"&gt;In May 2016, Disney Interactive shut down its internal studio, Avalanche Software, putting almost &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-10-disney-ceases-publishing-console-games-shutters-infinity"&gt;300 employees&lt;/a&gt; out of work. For Abalos, there was an extra complication. He was working in the states on an H-1B1 visa, a limited program for workers in Singapore and Chile, that requires renewal every year. Abalos only had a month until his visa expired. Not only would he not get the padding of unemployment benefits for anything beyond that date, like his colleagues, but his visa would soon be void, forcing him to leave the country. His life went from “‘Hey, we’re working on &lt;em&gt;Infinity 4&lt;/em&gt;, and this is awesome,’ to ‘Oh, shit. I need to find a job, like, now,’” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Itc4C"&gt;Every year, developers immigrate to the United States to pursue careers in game development. For some people, like Abalos who grew up in Chile, the US offers more opportunity than their home countries, where development communities can be small. According to the Entertainment Software Association’s 2020 economic impact report, the US industry alone supports 143,000 jobs directly. It is home to major developers like Electronic Arts, Valve, and Activision Blizzard across cities big and small, including New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, and Raleigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z0NAup"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Whoever wants to take me, I’ll do it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwshuY"&gt;Regardless of location, however, maintaining a successful game development career is always a challenge. Every year, studios suffer major layoffs, uprooting the lives of their employees. For immigrant workers, the problem is more complex. They don’t just lose a job. They might be forced to abandon their lives entirely and leave the country. This fear trickles down into different aspects of their careers, limiting where developers can afford to take jobs and how much leverage they have to ask for better pay or work conditions once they’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V570ZA"&gt;“It was every day, just desperately looking at job searches,” Abalos says. “Whoever wants to take me, I’ll do it.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUZ0AB"&gt;For developers here on visas, time is of the essence. In October 2020, Jennifer Scheurle lost her job suddenly after the project she’d been working on was canceled. Under her O-1 visa, which is given to people with “extraordinary ability or achievement,” she had only 60 days to transfer her visa to another company or leave the country. She started her job hunt that day. “Within the games industry, specifically, getting hired within two to three months is just not a thing, or really rare and difficult to do,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8thFO"&gt;Her health insurance would run out in roughly two weeks. “I lost my ability to go and see my therapist because I didn’t have coverage anymore, which is tough when you’re trying to figure out how to get your life in order,” she says. The project she’d poured her heart into for years was suddenly gone. Her life was thrown into a pressurized timeline of just 60 days, which she says is just not enough. “You have zero time to process what just happened to you. You have zero time to just understand what that means for your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0CRZj"&gt;The process can — and usually does — take months. Recruiters typically wait to attract a wide pool of candidates, who then go through an intensive screening and interview process. Developers may ask a candidate to meet large swaths of their teams, which adds up to hours of interviews. (Pre-COVID, this usually meant in-person gauntlets where a prospective hire could come to the company’s campus for an eight-hour day. As the industry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222465/coronavirus-game-developers-work-from-home-bungie-riot"&gt;works from home&lt;/a&gt;, more of that process is now relegated to video calls.) The long production time on video games, which take years to build, means companies must carefully consider who they want to bring on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MoKbuJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have zero time to process what just happened to you.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OMIQkB"&gt;Scheurle describes a loss of agency in her own life. “I felt like it was not on my own terms,” she says. “I was forced into terms and decisions dictated by this timeline and the [US visa process], instead of me having a minute to think about what I want next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVkwaG"&gt;Contributions from immigrant developers are crucial to maintaining a diverse, and therefore strong, workforce. Employers want to cast a wide net, a recruiter within the games industry tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;; it’s in a company’s best interest to explore talents, technical and artistic, that are vastly different from what they might find in the US alone. It’s impossible to directly track how this loss of talent impacts projects, both those being made now and yet to come. But that loss does exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PhdJE"&gt;Problems don’t just apply to developers in the midst of their careers, but also to young developers hoping to find a job out of college. Raj* came to the States as a student and was, by all accounts, on a successful path. His game was nominated for student awards and received press coverage and accolades. With a strong portfolio and plans to publish his game, he hoped to start a visa process that would help him stay in the country. His team’s dreams for publishing through Nintendo, however, and later a crowdfunding effort, fell through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="pypB6E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was a very real concern ... I could mistakenly end up in a border camp”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KOx2Vn"&gt;It was late April, and his visa was set to expire in May. He’d recently gotten engaged. At the behest of his lawyers, he was told not to leave the country, but rather start the green card process and try for parole that would allow him to stay in the country past his visa’s expiration. “We dropped everything to get this done within the two weeks we had,” Raj says. Instead of spending the year planning his wedding, he and his fiancé held a short ceremony in his in-laws’ backyard. His parents weren’t able to attend, but instead Skyped in. “We had to get everyone on the same page so quickly but we managed it somehow, and got the application submitted within time. Now I just had to wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70bQjG"&gt;And he did, for nearly seven months. The initial estimate of three months had stretched on, as complications arose from Trump administration policies. In the meantime, he was unable to take on any work. He was told “to stay indoors as much as possible so as to stay away from ICE agents. There was a very real concern on my lawyer’s end that I could mistakenly end up in a border camp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrFTgW"&gt;That time was challenging for Raj, a self-proclaimed nervous wreck who was “basically under house arrest” for fear of being deported. “I’d now been in the US for months on end with an expired visa and we were terrified we’d hear a knock on the door and it would be an ICE agent,” he says. “I had no idea how long this would continue, or when we’d run out of money. I knew I wasn’t doing well mentally at this point but we couldn’t afford therapy, and I no longer had access to any form of insurance, nor could I apply for any.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbnyTO"&gt;The problem is compounded by the need for many developers who come to the US on visas to have senior-level experience or positions already, the recruiter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Their on-paper qualifications and even country of origin vastly impact the kind of visa they might be able to apply for. Even with a job offer, some developers have had to forfeit those positions because the company couldn’t work out visa issues. Contract work is often inaccessible to developers not able to work in the US. “It’s an impossible fucking process where we lose out on talent on such a massive scale,” Scheurle says. Developers with less experience aren’t allowed to work in positions that might get them the skills they need to ascend to senior talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMkYXk"&gt;It also keeps developers from seeking out smaller companies that might afford them better or more creative opportunities in favor of a larger developer with a bigger bank. To get a visa, any visa, costs thousands of dollars and the help of a good immigration lawyer; some visas, like H-1B, follow strict timelines and approval caps. There’s little margin for error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iktF9n"&gt;“At the end of the day, the company also has to make a request for the visa, and the smaller companies just don’t know how to deal with it,” Abalos says. “Whereas a big company, like, say, Activision or Ubisoft, they have entire departments that deal only with that. That’s their sole purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Ua1u"&gt;It’s an exhausting amount of pressure. “There were points, like, why do I even keep bother trying?” Abalos says. “I mean, should I just start focusing instead on packing everything up and leaving.” Scheurle says the experience made her doubtful that she’d ever want to return to the States. “I love the US and the people as a place,” she says. “I just don’t ever want to go through that again. I want to be somewhere where people appreciate the humanity and what it means to move countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jCJlkL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The stories we don’t hear are even more frightening, even more tragic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mlRZc"&gt;Abalos was able to find a job and stay in the country, while Scheurle took a job in Vancouver. Raj still works in games today but says the trauma of his visa struggles continues to affect him. “I still have episodes now and then, and I can’t cope with high pressure environments like I used to,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqNUfq"&gt;Many of the developers &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke to still consider themselves to be privileged cases, whether because of their race, education, or financial status. They call themselves examples of best-case scenarios: people who either managed to stay in the country or found lucrative jobs elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsdoMS"&gt;Reflecting on his own experience, Raj, too, sees what he considers privileges. “I would have been deported a hundred times over without all the advantages I had,” he says, pointing to things like his industry accolades, financial support from his family, and access to an immigration lawyer. He calls his ordeal a hellish experience, but still one with positive outcomes that include a happy marriage. “I know from hearing what friends have also gone through that the stories we don’t hear are even more frightening, even more tragic.” The US, in particular, became a harder place for any immigrant to work under Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ZFKVPO"&gt;“I hope that in sharing my story,” Raj says, “a story where things ‘worked out,’ it helps people have more understanding and empathy for the ones that didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuXjFc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Name has been changed to protect the individual’s identity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLxzgR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSRVj1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter begins analyzing harmful impacts of its algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXYPaijXBcGwZWhmOzmNGPFdyTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69131231/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kCijza"&gt;Twitter is starting a new initiative, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-responsible-machine-learning-initiative.html"&gt;Responsible Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;, to assess any “unintentional harms” caused by its algorithms. A team of engineers, researchers, and data scientists across the company will study how Twitter’s use of machine learning can lead to algorithmic biases that negatively impact users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68rLo"&gt;One of the first tasks is an assessment of racial and gender bias in Twitter’s image cropping algorithm. Twitter users have pointed out that its auto-cropped photo previews seem to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;favor white faces over Black faces&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;began testing&lt;/a&gt; displaying full images rather than cropped previews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nznhs"&gt;The team will also look at how timeline recommendations differ across racial subgroups and analyze content recommendations across political ideologies in different countries. Twitter says it will “work closely” with third-party academic researchers and will share results of its analyses and ask for feedback from the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vab6yV"&gt;It’s not clear how much impact the findings will have. Twitter says they “may not always translate into visible product changes,” instead simply leading to “heightened awareness and important discussions” about how the company uses machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXjWVP"&gt;Twitter’s decision to analyze its own algorithms for bias follows other social networks like Facebook, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333405/facebook-instagram-racial-bias-equity-team-formed-ai-algorithms"&gt;formed similar teams in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304960/congress-algorithmic-accountability-act-wyden-clarke-booker-bill-introduced-house-senate"&gt;ongoing pressure&lt;/a&gt; from lawmakers to keep companies’ algorithmic bias in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpJvcy"&gt;Twitter is also in the early stages of exploring “algorithmic choice,” which will potentially allow people to have more input into what content is served to them. CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275441/jack-dorsey-decentralized-app-store-algorithms"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt; that he envisions an “app-store-like view of ranking algorithms,” from which people will be able to choose which algorithms control their feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
