    <title>Horizon Forbidden West delayed to February 18th, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pt0UTq6oUWX6A5oZISDDpf2e5M=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775414/Horizon_Forbidden_West_Dive_Logo_TM_LegalLine.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SZtVtz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn,&lt;/em&gt; has officially been delayed until February 18th, 2022, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/horizon-forbidden-west-arrives-on-february-18-2022/"&gt;a PlayStation blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1430611047308677123"&gt;Guerrilla Games&lt;/a&gt;. The game was expected to release near the end of 2021, but it was clear that time frame was more of a target than a fixed date — the &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;game’s page on PlayStation.com&lt;/a&gt; had its release date listed as “to be confirmed,” and PlayStation Studio head Hermen Hulst &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/02/hermen-hulst-qa-whats-next-for-playstation-studios/#sf246401757"&gt;said during an interview&lt;/a&gt; that the developers thought they were “on track” for a holiday 2021 release, but couldn’t be sure. He also said that part of the uncertainty was due to developers’ access to motion-capture equipment and actors during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0AcLt"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation Studios, which &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;’s developer Guerrilla Games is a part of, is currently involved in making a lot of games: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;more than 25, according to Hulst&lt;/a&gt;. Other titles included in this initiative have been delayed as well, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297059/gran-turismo-7-ps5-playstation-5-release-date-delay-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the next &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465232/god-of-war-ragnorok-ps5-ps4-delay-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xd5Rvg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Horizon Forbidden West is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 18 February 2022! Pre-orders will begin next week, on 2 September. Are you ready to continue Aloy's journey?&lt;a href="https://t.co/aMD8LIWbf8"&gt;https://t.co/aMD8LIWbf8&lt;/a&gt; ​&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HorizonForbiddenWest?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HorizonForbiddenWest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bRP3kToGji"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bRP3kToGji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guerrilla (@Guerrilla) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1430611047308677123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5g7oE"&gt;Companies outside of PlayStation Studios have also had some of their PS5-exclusives delayed — Arkane’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; (a timed exclusive for the platform) has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373588/bethesda-deathloop-ps5-delayed-date"&gt;pushed back to September 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373588/bethesda-deathloop-ps5-delayed-date"&gt;also won’t see a release until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxb56J"&gt;At this point, the PlayStation 5 still has relatively few games that really take advantage of its next-gen hardware, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the delays stacking up, it seems like this may still be the case come holiday season of this year. How much that will affect console sales, though, is hard to tell — Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;already sold 10 million PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re still hard to get due to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;ongoing silicon shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The good news for those who haven’t managed to snag a PS5 yet is that, when it comes out in February, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;will be available on the PS4 as well&lt;/a&gt;. The studio says pre-orders will start on September 2nd and that more info will be coming next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Zero Dawn’s newest update unlocks 60fps on PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y_LTu3Pot32Uw2kUKTCGsfpXb6k=/53x0:794x494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775391/horizon_zero_dawn_screenshot_01_pc_campaign_en_us_01jul20.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BqMBXA"&gt;Sony has released a new update for &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; enabling 60fps on PS5. The game was previously locked to 30fps on Sony’s newest console, so this update should help the game feel that much smoother. A &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague has confirmed that the update, 1.53, is available to download and install now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBXQNH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWgwFc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; is the latest game to get a 60fps boost on the PS5 — Sony has slowly been adding higher frame rates for some of its biggest PS4 hits since the PS5 was released. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443868/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps5-patch-update-60fps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; got one in May&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260829/god-of-war-2018-ps5-patch-free-update-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; got one in February&lt;/a&gt;, and Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1314641549406265346"&gt;added a 60fps option for &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was available when the PS5 launched in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaS4gc"&gt;Sony also announced that its sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will be released on &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/horizon-forbidden-west-arrives-on-february-18-2022/"&gt;February 18th, 2022, on PS4 and PS5&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the developers had been targeting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465232/god-of-war-ragnorok-ps5-ps4-delay-2022"&gt;a holiday 2021 launch&lt;/a&gt; for the game, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Jason Schreier reported in July that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/playstation-video-game-horizon-forbidden-west-delayed-to-2022"&gt;the game had been delayed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces $549 Halo-themed Xbox Series X console</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSFySXKNyOOCoEu5SoDRDot3Mw8=/68x0:1049x654/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775214/xboxconsole.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w5f8iS"&gt;Microsoft’s first custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-branded Xbox Series X console will arrive on November 15th. The $549.99 console includes dark metallic paneling, gold accents, and a star pattern to match the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe. It even powers on and off with custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed sounds, and Microsoft has changed the top fan section of the Xbox Series X from a green color to blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mPWFy"&gt;The console bundle will also include a custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-branded controller that matches the console, and Microsoft says this will be a very limited edition that will be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-series-x-halo-infinite-limited-edition-bundle%2F8rpm8t9ck0p6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder from Microsoft’s site today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEG-q33AZBinDco78szkH34v1Ug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805320/Halo_gamescom_Inline1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Halo-themed Xbox Series X console.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQ8q3"&gt;This is the first custom Xbox Series X console, but Microsoft has previously launched many custom Xbox consoles. A limited edition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989078/taco-bell-xbox-one-x-console-contest-microsoft"&gt;Taco Bell Xbox&lt;/a&gt; included the famous ring when you powered on the console, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/20/16175552/xbox-one-s-minecraft-limited-edition-leak"&gt;special &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt; looked like it had come straight out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FfrqQ"&gt;Alongside a custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-branded console, Microsoft is also launching a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Elite 2 controller. It’s designed to match the metallic green found on Master Chief’s armor, and it even has a custom case and D-pad. The Halo Infinite Limited Edition Elite Series 2 controller will also be available on November 15th, priced at $199.99. Preorders for the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Elite 2 controller &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%%5B%E2%80%A6%5Drollers%2Felite-wireless-controller-series-2-halo-infinite" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;begin today at Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Persona 5’s Morgana is coming to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BIjoygDu2PZv4V8qAVBIYKMjCWE=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775194/morganamonkeyball.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morgana can’t catch a break&lt;/em&gt; | Sega&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IK7v0b"&gt;In an effort to build up excitement for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22530302/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-remaster-three-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s releasing on October 5th, 2021, Sega has been plucking characters from its roster of games, past and present. Not only will &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22631024/yakuza-kazuma-kiryu-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Kazuma Kiryu&lt;/a&gt; serve as an unlockable character, Morgana from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; will appear as post-launch content on November 2nd, except it’ll cost $4.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUWu4f"&gt;Morgana plays a pivotal role in &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, serving as the gutsy feline sidekick to the protagonist and your rag-tag team of Phantom Thieves. In &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;, Morgana will collect chests instead of bananas. Sadly, there’s no mention of &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;-themed stages or music mentioned in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5FTon"&gt;Sega is really wringing out its IP to include characters that’ll appeal to as many people as possible. So far, Sega has confirmed that Beat from &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio &lt;/em&gt;and Sonic and Tails will join the squad of monkeys, along with the aforementioned Kiryu and Morgana. That’s a potent amount of fan service. But I’m not sold until we get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20850674/yoot-saito-interview-seaman-sega-dreamcast-ai-20th-anniversary"&gt;Seaman&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Thankfully, Sega is promising that “more iconic additions” will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A9whS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; will be available on October 5th, 2021 on all consoles for $39.99, or on Steam for $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midnight Suns is a new Marvel tactics RPG from XCOM studio Firaxis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPl_rrKfK8lS9-yGU1J-f5WgDxk=/276x0:2298x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775155/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.14.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWtHmV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://midnightsuns.2k.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a newly revealed tactical RPG from Firaxis Games that was just announced at Gamescom’s opening night event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQJ6SS"&gt;The game is said to take place in the “darker side of the Marvel Universe,” and it will have players take on the role of a new hero, The Hunter (which Firaxis created with Marvel). In &lt;em&gt;Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll team up with classic heroes like Iron Man, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade, Captain America, and Captain Marvel as part of the &lt;a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Midnight_Sons_(Earth-616)"&gt;Midnight Suns superhero team&lt;/a&gt; to battle a supernatural foe: Lilith. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPFajmSOHyE2oNrbSJja4nOVxJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805244/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.16.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ob0KEX"&gt;There’s not much information on the actual gameplay yet — although, given Firaxis’ work on the rebooted &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; series and the fact that &lt;em&gt;Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt; will be a tactical RPG, it seems like players should expect some sort of superheroic spin on its &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; formula here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0nrHC"&gt;Fans won’t have to wait long for more information: a gameplay reveal is planned for September 1st, and &lt;em&gt;Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt; will be released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Steam, and the Epic Games Store in March 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOhw7i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1428718469596471302"&gt;As teased by Geoff Keighley last week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; is the next video game series to get a reboot. Developer Volition has announced that the newest title, which is just called &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt;, is scheduled to be released on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC on February 25th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ST03av"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; titles are renowned for their over-the-top open-world gameplay that feels more inspired by cartoons than &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;. Originally a rip-off of &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, the franchise quickly grew into a consistently funny spoof of franchises, including — oddly enough — &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;and Michael Bay’s &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt;. This reboot looks to eject some of the more indulgent references but maintain the core gameplay that prioritized fun over silly things like “reality.” There appear to be weird outfits, cool cars, and absurd weapons aplenty. It also appears to have adopted another very welcome hallmark of the original franchise: a diverse cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0hrnCV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YgjzDJA1o1E?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oIoa2j"&gt;The game takes place in Santo Ileso, a city inspired by the American Southwest, and a CGI trailer showed off gritty desert roads, a Las Vegas-like district, and more. The story stars three main characters and your customizable protagonist as you build a criminal empire and take on three opposing factions inhabiting the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc9Ev0"&gt;It looks like a strong new entrant in the &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and fortunately, we won’t have to wait too much longer to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theater owners are already taking a victory lap in the fight for where movies screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3znjdD-IFvAQPCzZjk9phbnhus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774883/acastro_210813_1777_theater_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bi8fGw"&gt;A year of chaotic movie releases made the future of theaters look uncertain. But as cinemas reopen, hybrid releases that studios so warmly embraced amid COVID-19 are now having to answer in earnest to theater owners and talent attached to high-stakes films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvPVzi"&gt;During this week’s CinemaCon, the National Association of Theatre Owners’ annual convention, prominent figures from the film and exhibition industry rebuked the simultaneous release models and insisted that theaters and exclusive windows will survive after being pummeled during the pandemic. Speaking during this week’s event in Las Vegas, NATO boss John Fithian said that exclusive theatrical release windows “remain vital to the survival and success of the theatrical experience,” according to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/theater-owners-chief-john-fithian-cinemacon-1235047830/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBiLxQ"&gt;“What the future holds is up to our members and distributors to decide, but let us be clear about one thing: Simultaneous release does not work for anyone,” Fithian said, per the publication. He added that exclusive theatrical releases are “essential” to the recovery of both theaters and the greater movie ecosystem at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="28MHer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Simultaneous release does not work for anyone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RmgMP"&gt;AMC boss Adam Aron, meanwhile, said during the event that the only way to curb “massive piracy” is to distribute films in cinemas first, according to &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/cinemacon-nato-chief-john-fithian-amc-adam-aron-opening-remarks-1234820889/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sony Pictures Motion Picture president Josh Greenstein was &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/sony-cinemacon-windows-brad-pitt-bulett-train-spider-man-no-way-home-1234819844/"&gt;cited by the outlet&lt;/a&gt; as committing to distributing Sony films exclusively in theaters first, adding that cinemas “and the theatrical movie experience will triumph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRGP9Q"&gt;“Debuting movies simultaneously in theaters and in the home is devastating to our collective business,” Greenstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o11dRF"&gt;While perhaps unsurprising that a convention centered on theatrical distribution would rally so much support for theatrical exclusivity, the comments come at a pivotal moment for the theater industry. As lockdown orders lift and vaccinations allow moviegoers to return to cinemas, studios have begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22622638/movie-theaters-streaming-amc-cinemark-regal-exclusive-windows"&gt;renegotiating contracts&lt;/a&gt; for exclusive theatrical windows, albeit much shorter ones than the 90-day period of exclusivity theaters often had pre-pandemic. It follows a dramatic standoff between theaters during the earliest days of COVID-19, with AMC — the largest distributor in the nation — threatening at one point to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240637/amc-theaters-universal-trolls-world-tour-disney-warnermedia-digital-streaming"&gt;ban Universal movies&lt;/a&gt; from its screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sz9J3"&gt;But studios that have taken their films straight to streaming have also had to answer not just to theater owners, but to frustrated talent and directors as well. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Scarlett Johansson sued Disney&lt;/a&gt; over the day-and-date release of its Marvel film &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, with the actress claiming its hybrid release cost her millions in box office bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eXIzRC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These leading creatives know better, and they are on the right side of history.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvolYt"&gt;Denis Villeneuve, the director of arguably one of the year’s most anticipated titles, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/"&gt;wrote an open letter&lt;/a&gt; last year castigating WarnerMedia’s decision to make its 2021 film slate available on HBO Max the same day the films premiered in theaters. WarnerMedia &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warner-bros-legendary-nearing-deal-to-resolve-clash-over-godzilla-vs-kong-exclusive-4113497/"&gt;was also reported&lt;/a&gt; to have ponied up for potential losses for the hybrid release of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; with Legendary, which financed the majority of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDQhfX"&gt;Theaters are still worse off post-pandemic in terms of theatrical exclusivity, with windows in many cases shrunk to just 45 days or fewer. Netflix, the biggest player in the streaming game right now, still bypasses major exhibitors by releasing its films on its service. And Disney’s commitment to theatrical releases remains unclear, with Disney boss Bob Chapek saying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22622604/black-widow-lawsuit-disney-defends-release"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that “distribution decisions are made on a film-by-film basis.” Warner Bros. will still produce films that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;head straight to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, even while it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618697/amc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max"&gt;returns its movies&lt;/a&gt; to theaters with exclusive theatrical windows. So while theaters are back and the criticism of hybrid releases feels louder than ever, the threat to theatrical still remains — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emxCx9"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Fithian commended support for theatrical exclusivity in Hollywood during this week’s event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLSu6m"&gt;“I applaud artists who refuse to accept the false narrative that movie theaters are a thing of the past and that the future will be one in which every movie is consumed at home,” Fithian said, according to the outlet. “These leading creatives know better, and they are on the right side of history.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb says it will temporarily house 20,000 Afghan refugees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7uSkyzRigeFZ-YKvo7dKFwjfF3I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774845/airbnb_keys1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Emma Hardy, Airbnb&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4l399j"&gt;Airbnb and Airbnb.org &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/afghan-refugees/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that they will temporarily house 20,000 Afghan refugees for free. The effort, an evolution of the home renting platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195307/airbnb-free-first-responders-hosts-coronavirus-rentals"&gt;“Frontline stays” program&lt;/a&gt; for housing first responders, is in response to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/18/22582355/operation-allies-refuge-afghanistan"&gt;the refugee crisis&lt;/a&gt; caused by the US military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/15/22626082/kabul-capital-fall-afghanistan-government-taliban-forces-explained"&gt;the Taliban’s takeover of the country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yz2Dqi"&gt;“It has become abundantly clear that the displacement and resettlement of Afghan refugees here in the United States and elsewhere is a significant humanitarian crisis – and in the face of this need, our community is ready to once again step up,” the company wrote in its announcement. This is of course dependent on Airbnb’s existing hosts agreeing to help out. In a tweet thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067315228352512?s=20"&gt;announcing the plan&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky put out a call for Airbnb hosts interested in housing Afghan families on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BTQxJz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you’re willing to host a refugee family, reach out and I’ll connect you with the right people here to make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067720427425793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vl8TNF"&gt;For participating hosts and homes, the free refugee housing will be available globally, paid for by Airbnb, Airbnb.org (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158434/airbnb-nonprofit-essential-workers-coronavirus-refugees"&gt;Airbnb’s nonprofit counterpart&lt;/a&gt;), Chesky, and donors from the Airbnb.org Refugee Fund. Airbnb didn’t offer a specific timeline for how long the program will last, but the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; “we are planning to support the 20,000 refugees for as long as is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSohEq"&gt;Other companies have also made attempts to alleviate some of the harm caused by the US exit from Afghanistan. Facebook and Clubhouse have taken steps to secure accounts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634209/facebook-hides-friends-lists-instagram-safety-afghanistan-taliban-security"&gt;by hiding friends lists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635378/clubhouse-removes-personal-info-user-accounts-afghanistan-taliban-safety"&gt;removing personal info&lt;/a&gt;. The US Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/22/22636498/pentagon-afghan-airlift-evacuation-american-kabul-taliban"&gt;has also called on airline companies&lt;/a&gt; to help with further evacuations from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Most US government agencies are using facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kVUCHrtiirxW7ADfCeA2agq5s4U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774735/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cycGKR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-526"&gt;A new report from the Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; (GAO) found that 19 of the 24 US government agencies surveyed are using facial recognition in some way, illustrating how commonplace the controversial technology has become within the federal government. The list of agencies includes agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that maintain in-house systems, alongside smaller agencies that use the system to control access to high-security locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7g8ppU"&gt;“As the use of FRT continues to expand,” the report explains, “members of Congress, academics, and advocacy organizations have highlighted the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of how it is used by federal agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l7UGF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556068/federal-agencies-facial-recognition-report-privacy-security-oversight"&gt;A previous GAO report&lt;/a&gt; found federal agencies have few meaningful systems in place to track the use of privately contracted facial recognition systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Chart showing 18 agencies using facial recognition for different purposes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yYeJ2OhUcfXvJ4Fqf9DHc2CKz-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804725/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_10.48.01_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chart showing the results of the GAO survey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C7RD6e"&gt;One system described in the report, called “TacID Guard Dog,” is used by the Department of Energy to “monitor entry and exit from controlled locations.” The department purchased the system in December 2019 and spent roughly $150,000 to test it over the course of the following year. The same system is also used by the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEUjb1"&gt;The federal government operates a number of facial recognition systems. DHS uses the Automated Biometric Identification system to process travelers at border crossings, while the FBI’s Facial Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation service (or FACE) allows for broad matching capability in criminal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAoGcY"&gt;The report found four separate agencies that had used Clearview AI, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22522486/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-avoid-escape-privacy"&gt;a controversial private company&lt;/a&gt; that compares new photos against data scraped from social media platforms. DHS and the Justice Department used Clearview AI for conventional law enforcement searches, while the Department of the Interior employed the system through the US Park Police. Notably, the Office of the Inspector General in HHS also began a pilot of Clearview AI in September to “assist with identifying subjects of a criminal investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HbOZ0"&gt;Privacy advocates have raised significant concerns about racial bias in facial recognition, and states like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557516/maine-facial-recognition-ban-state-law"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/07/982709480/massachusetts-pioneers-rules-for-police-use-of-facial-recognition-tech"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; have passed specific measures to limit its use. However, those efforts have done little to slow federal use of the technology. In particular, Customs and Border Protection continues to expand the use of facial recognition in airports, both as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188526/airport-facial-recognition-us-customs-biometric-exit-expansion"&gt;the Biometric Exit program&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/ord-and-mdw-encourages-travelers-use-facial-recognition"&gt;voluntary programs like Global Entry&lt;/a&gt;. The TSA is currently testing a new facial recognition system as part of its credential verification system, although it remains unclear whether the system will roll out for wider use.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DsiiFD"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HfyKBe"&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly is a great business laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
