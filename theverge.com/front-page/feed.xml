    <title>New trailers: One Night in Miami, Chaos Walking, Justice League, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SE67KzR3OHkxyjnaU3tvlJgSUmA=/194x0:1387x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67842615/one_night_in_miami.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Night in Miami&lt;/em&gt; | Amazon Prime Video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DbJbWW"&gt;I am currently suffering from &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt; withdrawal after finishing Season 4, and (like pretty much everyone) predicting we’ll see Emmy nominations for Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher) and Josh O’Connor (Prince Charles). Also I’m very on board with this suggestion that &lt;a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a34706701/erin-doherty-the-crown-season-4-interview/"&gt;Erin Doherty deserves her own Princess Anne spinoff&lt;/a&gt; series (please get on this asap, Netflix). She’s spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xQgk6"&gt;I’m not quite ready to commit to a new streaming series yet so went to the backlog of movies I have queued up; I tried to get into &lt;em&gt;Queen’s Gambit&lt;/em&gt; but honestly, I don’t get the hype about that movie, the dialogue is so clunky.  I even went so far as to open an actual physical book yesterday (lol) before restarting Season 1 of &lt;em&gt;The Crown &lt;/em&gt;(hi Claire Foy and John Lithgow!). At least we still have &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; to look forward to every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWJ9aw"&gt;Some great new trailers this week and a couple of second trailers/teasers for highly anticipated movies whose theatrical debuts were derailed by the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QIhZjO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZprXMxKg--w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="m6EV1k"&gt;One Night in Miami &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ88pY"&gt;Oscar/Emmy/Golden Globe winner Regina King makes her feature film directorial debut with &lt;em&gt;One Night in Miami&lt;/em&gt;, an adaptation of Kemp Powers’ 2013 play of the same name. It tells the fictional story of a meeting of Muhammed Ali (then still known as Cassius Clay), Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, and Malcolm X, as they get together following Ali’s 1964 fight against Sonny Liston. Powers also wrote the script. The movie is generating &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/awards/one-night-in-miami-oscars-campaign-decision-1234819507/"&gt;huge Academy Awards buzz&lt;/a&gt; (obviously, with a powerhouse like King at the helm) and has already received praise from critics at the Toronto and Venice film festivals. Leslie Odom Jr., Kingsley Ben-Adir, Eli Goree, and Aldis Hodge star. &lt;em&gt;One Night in Miami &lt;/em&gt;will hit theaters on Christmas Day and debut on Amazon Prime Video January 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RcMZi5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRf4ZgzHoVw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OQzHYT"&gt;Chaos Walking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2huPAV"&gt;In a future dystopia, Viola (Daisy Ridley) crash lands on a planet of men who are affected by something called “The Noise” that makes all their thoughts visible. All the other women are dead, or so we are told (I mean I have watched more than one future dystopia sci-fi flick in my life). Based on the trilogy of books by Patrick Ness, &lt;em&gt;Chaos Walking&lt;/em&gt; also stars Tom Holland, Mads Mikkelsen, Nick Jonas, and David Oyelowo. It’s due in theaters January 22nd.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PGdNNw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psFf4KXJZoQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7J3iG5"&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vSIwk7"&gt;Warner Bros. announced last week that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; would be released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;in theaters and on HBO Max December 25th&lt;/a&gt;, and we got a new “main” trailer to tide us over, with new glimpses of Diana, Steve, and Kristen Wiig’s Cheetah (“I want to be an apex predator” right on, girl). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bRhvx1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XN6JawOGvpM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fhc2KV"&gt;Superintelligence &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="giuI0h"&gt;Not every movie is about a future dystopia or superheroes, you guys! Melissa McCarthy stars in this very goofy-looking comedy about a woman who has to prove to an AI (voiced by James Corden) who’s thinking of destroying the Earth that humanity is worth saving. Girrrrl, good luck. Bobby Cannavale and Bryan Tyree Henry also star (and I was especially happy to see Sam Richardson, the funniest person from the &lt;em&gt;Veep&lt;/em&gt; cast not named Julia Louis-Dreyfus). &lt;em&gt;Superintelligence&lt;/em&gt; comes to HBO Max November 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SpwCQX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYWzEqX-J-4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qT5XrI"&gt;Godmothered &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BSEH44"&gt;Look, I can’t stop the tide of Christmas movies, so just settle in and accept them for the next couple of weeks. This one looks pretty cute, with Jillian Bell as fairy godmother in training Eleanor. She tries to help a 40-year-old single mom who made a wish as a child that didn’t come true. Isla Fisher and Jane Curtin (yessss) also star in &lt;em&gt;Godmothered&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwB3Xc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3JOOv2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIOU_k4mwDw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e1VUap"&gt;Justice League: Director’s Cut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3dy866"&gt;The first full-length teaser of the Zack Snyder cut of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; shows us Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Superman, Cyborg, and The Flash with Leonard Cohen’s version of “Hallelujah” playing— which feels a little too slow for an action movie? I watched the trailer at 1.5 speed and with all due respect to the late, great Mr. Cohen, it seemed a better fit. You know the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295712/justice-league-snyder-cut-teaser-hbo-max-darkseid-gal-gadot-wonder-woman-lex-luthor"&gt;backstory about the Snyder Cut&lt;/a&gt;; it will hit  HBO Max in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLwFfY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fleets are still visible on Twitter after 24 hours thanks to a bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fWqUL-RQzoH1vFjocSyQ8E23zY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67841877/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NlAT92"&gt;Twitter’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;ephemeral tweets, known as fleets&lt;/a&gt;, are supposed to last for only 24 hours. But a bug is causing fleets to not totally disappear, remaining accessible well past their expiration dates. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/21/twitter-fleets-bug/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the bug allows fleets to be viewed and downloaded by other users, but without notifying the fleet’s author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIp2qA"&gt;“We’re aware of a bug accessible through a technical workaround where some Fleets media URLs may be accessible after 24 hours,” a Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are working on a fix that should be rolled out shortly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYfJoX"&gt; The “workaround” referenced appears to be a developer app that could &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby/status/1330078983350837248?s=20"&gt;scrape fleets from public accounts&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter’s API. The Twitter API doesn’t return URLs for fleets that are older than 24 hours, according to the company, and once the fix is rolled out, even if someone has a URL for active fleet, it won’t work after the expiration point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sibqi3"&gt;And while fleets are only visible on users’ timelines for 24 hours, Twitter stores fleets on its back end for up to 30 days, longer for fleets that violate its rules and may require enforcement action, the company says. During that 30 day period, a fleet is available in a user’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data"&gt;Twitter Data&lt;/a&gt; downloads as long as Twitter is retaining a copy.  The “seen by” action is typically only available when someone views a fleet via the Twitter app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PUakx"&gt;Twitter is a bit late to the disappearing content party— fleets are essentially its version of Instagram or Snapchat stories, They allow mobile Twitter users to briefly share text, videos, images, or other tweets. They’re not meant to be retweetable and you can’t directly “like” a fleet, but you can reply to one by tapping on it, which sends a direct message to the fleet’s creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sofyJD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEeBYq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 22nd, 10:56 AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Twitter and additional details&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charli D’Amelio hits 100 million TikTok followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon - Season 7" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgj5t2f2L8xg57uwJfa5mFpEgtk=/0x0:1998x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67841790/1206486671.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Lipovsky / NBC / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R2LfAH"&gt;Charli D’Amelio is the first TikTok creator to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio?lang=en"&gt;hit 100 million followers&lt;/a&gt;. She’s the first by some distance, too — only two other creators have cracked 50 million. On TikTok, that makes her more than twice as big as Will Smith, three times as big as The Rock, four times as big as Selena Gomez, and five times as big as Kylie Jenner and Ariana Grande.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qGaWK"&gt;It also means she reached 100 million subscribers in record time. On YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645542/tseries-100-million-subscribers-pewdiepie-youtube"&gt;it took 14 years&lt;/a&gt; before any channel hit 100 million. D’Amelio only started posting to TikTok in May 2019, and the app has only been available (under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-douyin"&gt;its current branding&lt;/a&gt;, at least) since August 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDdV8a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok doesn’t have many opportunities for creators to make money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFqQqh"&gt;It’s a huge milestone for both her and the app, but it also comes at a time when Charli — and her family — are increasingly trying to move beyond TikTok. Recent months have seen the launch of a podcast, further expansion into YouTube, the announcement of a book deal, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dalgmx"&gt;Creators frequently branch out onto other social networks and into more traditional media formats once they’ve found success on one platform. It lets them broaden their reach, talk to fans in more places, and provide some amount of insurance should one platform make a change that hurts their ability to thrive. YouTube creators, for example, have seen algorithm changes come and go that seem to prioritize and later deemphasize certain genres of video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iq9GV8"&gt;It also, often, has to do with their ability to make money. TikTok has started to offer payouts to creators, but &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-creators-fund-revenue-sharing-complaints/"&gt;creators have been disappointed&lt;/a&gt; with the returns. Creators also don’t widely have the ability to sell merch straight from the app. That means the two main ways TikTok stars can make money are by recording native ads, or leaving the app for opportunities elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEyS4F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The whole family has been expanding to different types of media&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qbBmar"&gt;The D’Amelio crew has been quick to build out an ecosystem of media around not just Charli, but the whole family. Dixie, Charli’s sister, released a debut single in June that quickly jumped onto &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Emerging Artists chart. (To date, the song’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKOptbo-QFw"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; has more than 92 million plays on YouTube alone). The sisters have started a podcast together, and both have been experimenting with traditional YouTube formats (“My Slime Review,” “I went surfing with Casey Neistat,” “I Tried These Snacks For The First Time”) to build followings over there as well. Charli is also working on a book due to be released next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83w0jn"&gt;Heidi and Marc, their parents, have started building an audience, too. They each have their own TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter accounts, and they feature prominently on the “D’Amelio Family” accounts on those same platforms. Perhaps the biggest sign of their success as a family is that, when Triller signed a deal for Charli to start posting to its platform, it brought the whole family along with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLzR4k"&gt;This time last year, Charli had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/meet-charli-d-amelio-tiktok-s-newest-viral-teen-celebrity-n1092626"&gt;around 6 million followers&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok. In the year since, both she and TikTok have seen a meteoric rise — but TikTok has also faced a barrage of political concerns that have put its future in question. It looks like TikTok will ultimately make it through — but if the platform begins to falter, Charli and her family have already secured plenty of other places to go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Echo and Eero products are discounted for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmZBnPd-lsyM3tPZhcQuZtsFdI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67841603/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the new fourth-generation Echo speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AMlWrv"&gt;Amazon has unveiled a heap of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; to give you an early start on your holiday shopping. While we expect &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; more deals across all categories of tech for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, these ones are focused on Amazon-made devices. This is especially good news since there are a bunch of new products seeing their first price cuts, including Amazon’s ball-shaped Echo speakers and Eero’s fastest mesh Wi-Fi routers. Plus, there are some solid deals on Fire TV streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="koAqPz"&gt;Smart speakers and displays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="w6K7c4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084J4KNDS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The smaller Echo Dot that takes the same globular form of the more expensive Echo&lt;/a&gt; is just $29 (usually $50)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tqFtlZ"&gt;If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new spherical Echo Dot with a digital clock embedded in the fabric&lt;/a&gt;, that one costs $39. It’s normally $60.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The slightly larger Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt; with a bigger screen and more powerful speakers is $65 (usually $130)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="LOCuxJ"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi routers&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s Switch with better battery life includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Black Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hOLV4cP3rfsB4nGMqwfZu0Gp8oM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67841119/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_mario.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cG7jI2"&gt;Ahead of Black Friday 2020, one of the best Nintendo deals is available early. If you are looking to buy a Nintendo Switch, Best Buy has a bundle that includes the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724307311813170402" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;console, a digital code for &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;, and three months of Nintendo Switch Online for just $300&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a unique deal — the Nintendo Switch costs $300, a copy of &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; costs $60, and three months of Nintendo Switch Online is $8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3r2Kc"&gt;The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;, as confirmed to us by a spokesperson at Best Buy. The updated Switch model includes two more hours of battery life than the original model. While in handheld, the updated Switch can be used anywhere between 4.5 hours to nine hours on a single charge, depending on what games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAKHXn"&gt;While an argument can be made for why all three of these products alone are good gifts, this bundle is great for late adopters of Nintendo’s hybrid console. &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;is a great game to play with family or friends, and if you want to play online, you will need a Nintendo Switch Online membership. Alongside access to playing Nintendo games online like &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, Switch Online also includes access to digital games such as &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt;, plus a selection of NES and Super NES titles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter, Facebook will transfer presidential accounts to Joe Biden on Inauguration Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5NW7rm0P-XHvVGM3lXwTcNz25Uo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67837378/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GM08PU"&gt;Twitter will transfer the @POTUS account to President-elect Joe Biden when he’s sworn in on Inauguration Day, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/20/twitter-trump-transition-biden-potus-438880"&gt;the company told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter will transfer the account to Biden even if President Donald Trump hasn’t conceded — which he still hasn’t done, despite the election widely being called for Biden earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atzyY5"&gt;“Twitter is actively preparing to support the transition of White House institutional Twitter accounts on January 20th, 2021,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As we did for the presidential transition in 2017, this process is being done in close consultation with the National Archives and Records Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLW2PL"&gt;Other presidential accounts, including @whitehouse, @VP, and @FLOTUS, will be moved over as well, &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reports. The existing content on all of the accounts will be archived before the transfer (here’s Barack Obama’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS44"&gt;@POTUS archive&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re curious), and the accounts will be reset to show zero tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b05Eki"&gt;Trump will continue to control his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, after Biden’s inauguration, but the account will lose the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;special protections&lt;/a&gt; it gets due to Trump’s status as a world leader — meaning he will be subject to the same rules as the majority of the users on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5283fc"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/twitter-facebook-hand-over-potus-account-biden-january-20-n1248523"&gt;Facebook told Reuters&lt;/a&gt; it would also transfer the official POTUS account on its platform to the incoming administration. “In 2017, we worked with both the Obama Administration and incoming Trump Administration to make sure the transition of their Facebook and Instagram accounts was seamless on January 20th, and we expect to do the same here,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uLJoS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 21st 4:40PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds information that Facebook will transfer its POTUS account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zFPlP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: We originally said in one sentence that Twitter hadn’t replied to a request for comment, but they had. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV remote has yet another alternate option that includes buttons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_TKSU7PjnTlANaXHz0N_u-purl0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67840072/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhEt5t"&gt;Universal Electronics Inc. (UEI) has introduced its version of the notoriously unpopular Apple TV remote “specifically developed and designed” for cable, satellite, and MVPD  (multichannel video program distributor) customers, &lt;a href="https://www.uei.com/press/2020/11/20/universal-electronics-inc-to-launch-apple-tv-remote-control-for-mvpds/"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmcekl"&gt;The remote uses Bluetooth low energy or infrared to connect with the box, has a microphone to speak commands to Siri, and its universal remote function allows control of TVs and audio devices from any brand or manufacturer. It has backlit keys, which activate via an ambient light sensor, a button to flip through channels, and a mute button, according to UEI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uTFoG"&gt;“We’re excited that customers worldwide will soon be able to enjoy this new remote, designed specifically for the growing number of MVPDs offering Apple TV 4K to their subscribers,” said Paul Arling, CEO of Universal Electronics, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fatbaa2eJb0BPJrmg92AGVM69D4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22065126/uei_remote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Universal Electronics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Electronics new remote is for Apple TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dl5Ass"&gt;Universal isn’t the first company to introduce an Apple TV remote alternative; last year, Swiss TV and internet provider &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;Salt developed a remote&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with Apple after the touchpad controls on the native remote proved frustrating for users used to having standard buttons. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;Function introduced its Button Remote for Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; in July. The Salt model has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332433/apple-tv-remote-buttons-function-salt-siri-streaming-box-controller-price"&gt;difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHO3"&gt;UEI’s remote will be available beginning next year, but consumers won’t be able to buy the remote directly from Universal. The company plans to sell branded versions of the remote directly via the cable companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQ9WM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest teardown from iFixit shows how huge the iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ctoKDZ2fyt0fyi4Fs4Ns0IZ7Btk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67839634/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has an enviable camera&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest iPhone ever, with a 6.7-inch display that boasts a camera system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;our reviewer called&lt;/a&gt; “one of the most confident smartphone cameras.” In its latest teardown, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fifixit.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt; shows how big this impressive camera actually is compared to other iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7CJLcRZjqLg6Fj0KNzy1UKDp2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064774/iphone_pro_max_12_camera.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max camera is quite large&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SrEDMF"&gt;The primary wide-angle sensor “dwarfs the iPhone 12’s sensor,” iFixit says, coming in around 47 percent larger. But it has the same 12 MP resolution as the smaller model. The 12 Pro Max’s sensor-shift image stabilization system— found on most DSLR cameras— adds bulk to the large main camera, iFixit found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pu0uma"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXjDFdNVnXo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0Zdbb"&gt;The 12 Pro Max’s L-shaped battery is the largest among all current iPhone models, weighing in at 14.13Wh, compared to the 8.57Wh in the mini and the 10.78 Wh in the 12 and 12 Pro. But iFixit notes that’s actually slightly smaller than the 15.04Wh pack found in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro Max. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GprY-JuSf5E6QLdwOI52IYPtyIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22064775/iphone_12_pro_max_battery_l.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max battery (right) dwarfs the other iPhone 12 model batteries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iRSQ2j"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max —the most expensive iPhone on the market right now starting at $1,099 — “is arguably Apple’s finest iPhone-related achievement this year,” iFixit says. The device adds “demanding 5G tech with no obvious compromises to other components.” Check out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiPhone%2B12%2BPro%2BMax%2BTeardown%2F138640%3Fvgo_ee%3D3bheJeT%252FPRsWKKl8dfWh0vlMy%252BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F11%2F21%2F21588664%2Fapple-iphone-12-pro-max-teardown-ifixit-camera#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit’s full teardown&lt;/a&gt; of the iPhone 12 Pro Max here. &lt;/p&gt;

The ultimate goal of the Starlink program is to provide global internet coverage from space, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;SpaceX launched the public beta&lt;/a&gt; test last month, after&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325413/spacex-starlink-user-terminals-antennas-internet-satellite-constellation-beta-testing"&gt; introducing a private beta&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqMhMG"&gt;Beta users had to buy all of the Starlink ground equipment for $499 and then pay a $99 monthly fee for active service to participate in the program. An email to those invited to the public beta said users could “expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system.” The email also indicated there would be brief periods of no connectivity, and that latency and data speeds would improve as the company prepares to launch more satellites and installs more ground equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99Pj40"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317082/spacex-falcon-9-starlink-blacksky-rideshare-launch-time-visor-watch-live"&gt;SpaceX already has launched&lt;/a&gt; into low-Earth orbit 900 of the planned 12,000 satellites needed for the Starlink system. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said the company needs 800 satellites in space to provide “significant operational capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Tjk3"&gt;To ask questions of Starlink engineers (and there’s already a queue with more than 500 comments), go to the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/"&gt;official Starlink Reddit page&lt;/a&gt;. The AMA runs from noon to 1PM PST.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Giving thanks during a pandemic </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-FOOD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cfIP91y9dDvt8_OVxYaQyyz1u30=/13x0:4287x2849/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67838978/1229701113.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k8ChPC"&gt;Celebrating Thanksgiving during a pandemic is weird. It’s more stress, more risk calculations, more staying away from people you’d normally draw close to. It feels sucky and dark and I know there’s a lot of people like me who are going to be so grateful for 2020 to be over. But as much as this year has been the worst, it’s also shown us how we humans can be a lot better when we actually &lt;em&gt;try. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmtkfW"&gt;This year, I’m thankful for the researchers who have worked carefully and swiftly to develop extremely promising vaccine candidates. They took an impossible task and got it to the finish line in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTRBqT"&gt;I’m thankful for the volunteers who were willing to enroll in clinical trials, and put their bodies on the line to help those researchers figure out if the vaccines worked. Their decision to participate is what makes it possible for us to figure out how safe and effective any of the vaccines are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="pGNnT2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUAjU4"&gt;I have a deep debt of gratitude towards the professional gadflies — the experts and journalists who have demanded transparency throughout this entire pandemic. They’ve pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/dont-wear-mask-yourself/610336/"&gt;for us to wear masks&lt;/a&gt; and for official acknowledgment that this &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/health/cdc-coronavirus-airborne-indoor-air.html"&gt;virus can spread through the air&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-11-20/covid-tracking-project-volunteers-step-up-as-u-s-fails-during-pandemic"&gt;kept track of the numbers for us&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/"&gt;shone a light on rampant incompetence&lt;/a&gt; that’s made the virus worse than it ever needed to be. Now, they are demanding that the companies manufacturing the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/21556380/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-optimism-skepticism"&gt;give us more than just the research highlights&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5J2b5"&gt;Thank you to the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/third-surge-breaking-healthcare-workers/617091/"&gt;exhausted healthcare workers&lt;/a&gt; in the US, who are doing their best to tread water, even though they know a wave of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/11/americas-best-prepared-hospital-nearly-overwhelmed/617156/"&gt;illness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/11/coronavirus-death-rate-third-surge/617150/"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; is headed their way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VldxiI"&gt;Thank you to the disaster and public health researchers who have screamed into the void for the past year. They’ve tried everything they could to get us important messages, shore up supply lines, and stay one step ahead of a virus that’s outpacing a nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Pyr37"&gt;Thank you to the places that have actually managed to beat back the virus for providing an example on how to really put those researchers’ words into action — to &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/18/1007135/mongolia-coronavirus/"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54388340"&gt;Senegal &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/19/21541810/vermont-covid-19-coronavirus-social-distancing"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/17/how-covid19-has-been-curtailed-in-cherokee-nation/"&gt;Cherokee Nation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/world/australia/coronavirus-isolation.html"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, along with all the others who have paid attention to the scientists.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifJ5Am"&gt;Thank you to the people who have kept wearing a mask, even when it’s annoying and they’d rather not. Also, to the people who are keeping their distance from others, as painful as it may be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD0Onx"&gt;Thank you to the people who are working to keep their neighbors fed, and housed, and healthy, often for paltry wages. They deserve more. So do the people who are unemployed or incarcerated or homeless during this devastating pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzblEz"&gt;I’m especially thankful for you. Thank you for reading, and for joining me and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/nicole-wetsman"&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt; here every Saturday morning for the past few months.  We’ll be taking a break next weekend, but we’ll be back on December 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qI1PJV"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oJICgP"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgfUyV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-masks.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confused About Masks? Here’s What Scientists Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s been some weird stuff coming out this week about masks, including a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/20/mask-danish-study/"&gt;widely-ridiculed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/health/coronavirus-masks-denmark.html"&gt;study out of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. This article breaks down the current state of mask knowledge. Bottom line: wear one. (Apoorva Mandivalli/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4C5pX9"&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yahc22"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575207/antibody-treatment-distribution-limited-dose-coronavirus-treatment"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virus surges complicate the distribution of scarce COVID-19 treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monoclonal antibody treatments can help prevent people from developing the worst symptoms of COVID-19, but they are also in very short supply. Not only that, but health systems are so overwhelmed by new cases, that figuring out how to get the treatment to people who need it in time is a gargantuan task.  (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMKucD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderna says its COVID-19 vaccine is 94.5 percent effective in early analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday, Moderna announced that its vaccine was highly effective in its clinical trials. It also announced that its vaccine candidate could be stored in a refrigerator for up to 30 days, making it easier to distribute than anticipated. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DTkdd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated analysis shows Pfizer vaccine is 95 percent effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Days after Moderna’s announcement, their rivals at Pfizer and BioNTech released more detailed data on their own vaccine, claiming it was 95 percent effective in their trials. On Friday, Pfizer and BioNTech became the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/pfizer-covid-vaccine.html"&gt;first to file for an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1329912068322062338"&gt;FDA will meet on December 10&lt;/a&gt; to consider their application. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnlUca"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/health/covid-vaccine-95-effective.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Companies Say Their Vaccines Are 95% Effective. What Does That Mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to know more about the math behind the vaccine headlines, this breakdown is a good one. (Carl Zimmer/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pahrDM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587664/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-two-doses-shots"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first COVID-19 vaccines will likely require two shots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wondering why both Pfizer and Moderna are making vaccines that require two shots? It’s a training regimen for your immune system. (Kait Sanchez/&lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tIqcx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/11/18/fda-authorized-covid-home-test-but-rollout-limited-lucira/6339008002/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FDA approves first home COVID-19 test: Here’s why most Americans won’t get it before next spring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;An at-home COVID-19 test was approved this week by the FDA. It will only be available in limited quantities in some states this year. (Ken Alltucker/&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WIF9xj"&gt;Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4j90bJ"&gt;I get the same comments all the time over Facebook or email. “Oh, she’s blowing it out of proportion.” “She’s a communist.” “She’s a bitch.” “She’s pushing her agenda.” Okay, fine. I do have an agenda. I want disease transmission to go down. I want to keep this community safe. I want fewer people to die. Why is that controversial?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kEDgeo"&gt;— &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/18/health-care-worker-threats-coronavirus/?arc404=true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amber Elliott, county health director as told to Eli Saslow, &lt;/em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t1aEne"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y94GO9"&gt;To the more than 57,726,802 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbnoli"&gt;To the families and friends of the 1,374,985 people who have died worldwide — 254,473 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4cwFh"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
