    <title>Twitter removes thousands of accounts linked to Chinese Xinjiang propaganda</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A3qGoY"&gt;Twitter has removed a total of 2,160 accounts linked to Chinese regional and state propaganda campaigns, the &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/disclosing-state-linked-information-operations-we-ve-removed"&gt;social network has announced&lt;/a&gt; as part of its latest data release on misinformation campaigns. The accounts were attempting to push back against allegations of human rights abuses by the Chinese government against the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESS6oQ"&gt;Alongside it, Twitter has also detailed a campaign it discovered in Tanzania, which used copyright complaints to harass members and supporters of the FichuaTanzania human rights group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WutKoG"&gt;Twitter says 2,048 of the accounts “amplified Chinese Communist Party narratives related to the treatment of the Uyghur population,” while a further 112 were connected to a private company backed by the regional government. But according to analysis from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), one of the three research partners which Twitter shared information with, much of the propaganda was “embarrassingly” produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="haDF7Y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  NEW REPORT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASPI_ICPC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ASPI_ICPC&lt;/a&gt;'s report '&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StopXinjiangRumors?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StopXinjiangRumors&lt;/a&gt;: The CCP’s decentralised disinformation campaign' the authors analyse two Chinese state-linked networks seeking to influence discourse about Xinjiang across  Twitter &amp;amp; YouTube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Read here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/MmS3ybuj6B"&gt;https://t.co/MmS3ybuj6B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ASPI Cyber Policy (@ASPI_ICPC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ASPI_ICPC/status/1466361477917405184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYqkdB"&gt;According to research from the thinktank &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/xinjiang-twitter-closes-thousands-of-china-state-linked-accounts-spreading-propaganda"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, each network put out over 30,000 tweets, often disputing evidence of human rights abuses, as well as attempting to push the Chinese government’s version of events. But despite the seriousness of the abuses, much of the data analyzed from the campaign was linked to pornography, Korean soap opera content, and spam accounts, likely because the network had taken over and reused existing accounts. Hundreds of the tweets were linked to an account with the handle @fuck_next, while others tried and failed to tag former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSe95s"&gt;Most of the accounts had a small number of followers, or none at all, and the overwhelming majority of their tweets had seen zero engagement. The exception was when Chinese officials retweeted them, introducing them to a much broader audience. It’s content that’s unlikely to win over new supporters but is “propaganda appealing to the base,” ASPI researcher Albert Zhang tells &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fssO6Y"&gt;In contrast, the operation linked to Tanzania appears to have been much more sophisticated, although it involved a comparatively smaller number of 268 accounts. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shelbygrossman/status/1466395071276740608"&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford Internet Observatory researcher who worked on the report, Shelby Grossman, explained that the pro-government network would take anti-government content posted by activists, republish it on an external website with a date that predated the tweet, and then report the tweet to Twitter on copyright grounds to have it removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ksabvi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/ A pro-Tanzanian government network adversarially leveraged copyright reporting to harass activists. The scheme was fascinating. Stylized scheme below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/zEo5MttjQK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zEo5MttjQK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Shelby Grossman (@shelbygrossman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shelbygrossman/status/1466395071276740608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N0Np6v"&gt;“The tactic sometimes worked,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shelbygrossman/status/1466395081657647106"&gt;Grossman writes&lt;/a&gt;, “Twitter suspended 2 activist accounts, though both were ultimately reinstated.” But it’s a difficult situation for the activists to end up in, since countering the copyright complaint might compromise the source of the anti-government material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEIEoB"&gt;The treatment of Xinjiang’s Uyghur population has been referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;” and is said to include mass internments, reeducation, forced labor, and even sterilization. Twitter has publicly clashed with Chinese authorities about the human rights abuses before and, in January this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242086/twitter-chinese-embassy-in-us-uighur-muslim-tweet-dehumanization"&gt;locked its US embassy’s Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; for referring to Uyghur women as “baby-making machines” prior to government intervention. As of this writing, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChineseEmbinUS"&gt;the account&lt;/a&gt; appears to still be locked and has not tweeted since January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9BhiF"&gt;As well as these China and Tanzania-linked operations, Twitter says it’s removed accounts related to misinformation campaigns from Mexico, Russia, Uganda, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meet the Nvidia and AMD GPU hunters who turned battling bots into a full-time job</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-LXX6jt9rZN48CcQEE5v0Hm8Xpg=/16x0:2640x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70223494/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Falcodrin tells us the average gamer has barely any chance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4UqZnO"&gt;Last September, a bored 24-year-old from South Carolina decided to livestream the launch of Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics card, little knowing the GPU was about to become one of the most difficult-to-buy gadgets in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQkRFL"&gt;Now, Larry says he’s on track to pull in $100,000 a year — and another $100K for his software development partner Stu — as the proprietors of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/falcodrin"&gt;Falcodrin Stock Alerts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://t.co/i2TAItNORw?amp=1"&gt;Falcodrin Community Discord&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve become full-time GPU hunters, helping others find an estimated 50,000 graphics cards (and counting) in exchange for affiliate revenue. You sign up for alerts and get a ping when a GPU’s in stock. Like what you see? When you press the buy button, that retailer gives Falcodrin a piece of the action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpHgqo"&gt;But if you’re hoping to find a GPU this holiday season, Falcodrin has a message for you: it might be a cold winter, because retailers, scalpers, and stock trackers are all locked in a software arms race that kicks the little guy to the curb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAgfqD"&gt;“It’s a bot war,” say Larry, who asked us not to use his full name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H10IOj"&gt;So what’s a gamer to do? Here are some excerpts from my interview with the Falcodrin crew about how they cheat the system, how the system cheats you, and how that scalper arms race is pushing Falcodrin to build bots of their own. Plus, some tips if you’re still trying to nab a graphics card yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsjQNK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity. Fun note: despite now living in different parts of the world, Larry and Stu tend to finish each others’ thoughts, and there were a couple times I lost track of who said what. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="dYh77D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Falcodrin? What do you do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G62RXi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry:&lt;/strong&gt; I consider us to be a switchboard operator; we send you where you want to be. You set up Discord on your computer and on your phone. When something drops, your computer makes a noise, you get a link, and you do your best to buy. We try to let you know as fast as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRTwMK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;Role-wise, Larry is kind of the operations and community engagement manager. He engages with the community via Twitch and Discord, whereas I focus mainly on dev. When new people come in, they join our general chat, and our users fill them in on how the game is played. Everybody’s trying to figure out their own ways to get through websites and retailer protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJeA8D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s like they don’t want us doing that for some reason! Websites that prevent scraping are an annoyance for me, because the better we scrape ... that’s a thousand fewer people who are pinging EVGA themselves on their own computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alerts are pinging for various types graphics cards in a column on the left, while a chat window in the center lists each item with their price and link and emoji reactions from various community members." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzVdESBzhCk0f48tSxAi11DAzs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058988/falcodrin_discord.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A relatively representative sample of the Falcodrin Community Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HJ7ccW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu&lt;/strong&gt;: Our Discord is the focus. You come in and sign up for roles. What kind of alerts do you want to receive? Are you interested in buying a PS5, an Xbox, do you just want a 3080? As soon as something comes in stock, we ping an alert to that particular role, that particular product, and we try to be the fastest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="895R9w"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is buying a GPU so hard? What’s going on behind the scenes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7j3tCc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;In a nutshell, retailers ... I think the traffic load on their website really hurts them and they’re trying really hard to stop the volume of traffic. This is my speculation, I don’t run these servers, but the more volume hitting your website, the more server cost you have. It also hurts the purchasing process — you can see large holes in their websites which prevent anyone from being able to check out and purchase products. There’s a clear need for them to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="BkCx7r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Annnd they yanked it right out of my cart. Great shopping experience once again, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BestBuy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BestBuy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hycn1LoGXW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hycn1LoGXW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1334167428872343555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NgPot"&gt;The actions we’ve noticed are things like implementing a queue system. Instead of having a huge volume of people waiting in the lobby of a building, they create a queue which puts everyone in the parking lot outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iyr4FV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s the policeman who counts everyone who goes inside the building to make sure you’re within fire safety standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlRha8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;If we can get some kind of message across, it’s that the systems they’re putting in place to prevent the heavy load are preventing regular users, the users who want to buy just one, and enabling bots and software to win &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4Bly5"&gt;The bots go straight to checkout. They’ve figured out how to checkout without even going to the site. By putting up these queue systems they’re blocking the traffic load, but the bots are going through the back door and purchasing all the items — while shoppers are still sitting there in the parking lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEYrRX"&gt;They need to lock the back door, not the front door. It makes us question: do they care? Are they just trying to save on infrastructure costs? At the end of the day, it’s bots and scalpers that drive up the price of these goods and give them higher margins. Some retailers might even enjoy it because they get to ship them as a pallet, saves them a lot of money in shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3dClWS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They need to lock the back door, not the front door. It makes us question: do they care?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4uK9Sx"&gt;Recently, Walmart is one of the really bad examples. They just put in a queue system where you could just go to your cart where you’d ordered a PS5 and reorder it. “You scalped a PS5 before? Here’s a free ticket to get another one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sEPSyE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The gaming industry keeps failing miserably at selling its most important products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"},{"title":"The true price of a PS5 or GPU, November 2021 edition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EYnzFw"&gt;We haven’t yet done the full auto-checkout, auto-buy-now because that’s associated with scalpers. We develop scripts and helper tools. You’re still manually checking out, but we help you get through some of the tricky stuff by offering little scripts you can run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvH5kl"&gt;We are just to the point now where we’re starting to develop bots because a lot of the retailers are so bad, so heavily botted we have to develop auto checkout tools just to compete — just to get past the other bots. It’s a bot war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUDxgH"&gt;At the end of the day it’s our users versus some other Discord users. We represent the little guy, or at least that’s what we’d like to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="I3I5sy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know your users are gamers? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUHZhq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no way to be certain, but there are users who post their one win and then they’re gone. The ones posting two to three a week, we don’t always know, but they talk about mining and they show pictures of their rigs. It gets a little iffy when people are buying tons of cards and not showing pictures of their rig, and buying LHR cards, then it’s hmmm ... but most of them are staying quiet. I think the scalpers are keeping a very low profile, keep it to themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jh1rEL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They know we’re going to ban them on the spot.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpL2I6"&gt;I don’t get upset at people who stand in a line, because if they’re standing in line to resell a graphics card, they probably need that extra $500. But if it’s someone who’s botting and gets 70 cards in a drop and will resell them for thousands of dollars in profit, that’s when you get pissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y25GX0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;You can’t stop them all, we’re going to have scalpers and miners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTKKvD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;At least they’re smart enough to keep their mouths shut because otherwise they know we’re going to ban them on the spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="INIvRI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share some tricks of the trade?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EL2b3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;Some of them are very basic: enabling a buy button that’s been disabled. You open up the inspector in Chrome, open up the network requests, and you can right-click on it and turn off its disabled state. Set it to enabled, and then you can click on it. GameStop — it’s still there! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toAIJS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;We have this little blip of Javascript you can paste in...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iy2D8z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;Or you can right-click if you know any HTML, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out. One of our competitors created an extension for Best Buy — it recently stopped working, but what Best Buy does is you’ll have a little bit of a queue, a five-minute queue or 30-second queue, and the trick is called re-rolling the queue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI9Wh6"&gt;It lets you click Add to Cart again, which gives you a new queue time. You just click the button until your queue time is 30 seconds instead of five minutes. That could be the time between getting one and not getting one, and so that’s crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pB8Hu90PSWq2kXb9UF0M2oOUdyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058939/AMD_falcodrin_timing.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What an AMD drop looks like in the Falcodrin Community Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3YaJkB"&gt;With AMD, we created a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampermonkey"&gt;Tampermonkey&lt;/a&gt; script which added an add-to-cart button to every item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoiN35"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry:&lt;/strong&gt; It became a problem because AMD would go out of stock before the cards were visible to anyone on the planet. The inventory would show on their website, but nobody globally would see any stock. It harmed people who weren’t in the know enough to see that there was a card out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edtVO9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;Now AMD has a queue instead, but the queue is random: you might be put at the front of the line, the middle, the end of the line — it’s not first-come, first-serve. But somebody realized if you open up multiple sessions that don’t know about each other, you can open the queue 10 times, and it’s like rolling the dice 10 times instead of just once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k6LOoj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;We actually created a tool that makes it easy for you to open 500 independent sessions and we call it the AMD Queue Buster. The problem now is that AMD is dealing with 500,000 sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0SiX7"&gt;This is the kind of stuff we have to resort to, because bots were going through the &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; door — they didn’t even have a queue! By the time you got to the front of the website, your really good time would be eight minutes. You know what was left in eight minutes? Nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mxJVuD_Uk6eLdxf-xBXdNxS988=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058921/slack_ODtKTvuFtn.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even though I signed up for the AMD queue as soon as it opened, my wait time was over an hour. Tricks like Falcodrin’s let you “re-roll” your wait time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CVTIKI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;We have so many hacks. Just before a Newegg Shuffle — this is good old-fashioned social engineering — you call up customer service, you hope you get a newbie. You say “your website shows Add to Cart, but when I click it doesn’t add to cart.” Hopefully their manager approves purchase of said product. It works because you know which cards are going to be in the Newegg Shuffle before it opens, so you know what’ll be in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Zle04H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you charge for your own bots?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxSmsl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;It was never part of our business plan, but it has become the plan ... we’re going to do it because we have to. In January, I think we’ll have quite a few retailers as part of our checkout bot. Our plan is to be super cheap; we could make absolute fortunes, but that’s not our goal. It’s more of a lifestyle business for us. We’d just ask to pay for development costs, because we’ll have to pull in a few more resources. Stu is just one man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="XCaMPt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should our readers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; get a GPU?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCwcYn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re trying to protect your mental health, you sign up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776567/evga-line-queue-to-get-nvidia-rtx-3000-graphics-card-works"&gt;for EVGA’s queues&lt;/a&gt;, you enter the Newegg Shuffle, or if you’re willing to spend a little extra, go buy a bundle on Newegg or AntOnline. Just give up on the Founders Edition cards, they don’t exist anymore. For the cheaper cards, you’re going to be searching for a long time. If you’re not willing to spend your entire life on a Discord, hunting, you got to be willing to wait and let the systems work the way they do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pc1N9x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;You spend a bit more, or you buy things you don’t really want to buy in a bundle, or you spend your time, like our users do, to learn the ropes. It’s still possible to get GPUs, but it’s a time investment to get them at MSRP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="ZH7S0A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today it's just $540 for a $330 video card. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you win a raffle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madness. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mY4nPEpoE7"&gt;https://t.co/mY4nPEpoE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1371538511271141378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sNHl8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re going to spend hundreds of hours to save a hundred bucks, and the time investment doesn’t make sense. If you get a card within three to four hours at this point, you’re doing really good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiAFrt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a side note to that, and that’s due to COVID, I think people enjoy the community because they’re kind of a bit bored and locked away at home. It isn’t just, “I’m going to spend a hundred hours here because all I want is GPUs” — it’s the social aspect, the community, having a common interest with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="HheFZx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When and where are the best chances?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7enJa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcodrin: &lt;/strong&gt;Times and dates are all over the place. Sign up for the Newegg Shuffle, obviously. We’re actually seeing a lot of people win the shuffle now. It’s a really annoying system, they should penalize people who sign up for things and don’t buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8pFXB"&gt;Best Buy’s been weekly recently, sometimes Friday but mostly Thursday — early mornings, 10, 10:30AM Eastern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXu6by"&gt;Amazon is just whenever, all the time. EVGA B-stock is usually Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, usually in the afternoon or evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XElx1"&gt;Zotac is just whenever Zotac wants ... but recently their prices have gotten so high: $2,800 for a 3090, that is just nuts. So Zotac has really pushed a lot of people away. Most of the people who click a Zotac link are there for the entertainment, very few are there to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmTPyY"&gt;GameStop drops like once every four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeMUDU"&gt;If you’re looking for an AMD card, that’s pretty consistent: 9:50AM Eastern time, on Thursdays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="VjxWUW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22797788/price-ps5-xbox-nvidia-amd-rtx-gpu-scalpers-ebay-update"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermarket prices are bonkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. What kind of premium should you actually expect to pay at retail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PBU3d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falcodrin: &lt;/strong&gt;3060s, we’re seeing anywhere from $550 to $750. 3060 Tis are close to the same range, but there just aren’t as many ‘60 Tis compared to ‘60s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7yMw2"&gt;3070s are about $700, $800 now for most of them — ‘70 Tis have been pretty steady at $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRSPJu"&gt;3080s, $1,200. I was pretty happy recently when I got an ‘80 LHR with headset and mouse for $1,200 flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXr5Ft"&gt;3080 Tis you can regularly find for $1,400 to $1,600, sometimes $1,750, but most of the really nice ones are like $2,000. The Strix is like $2,199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFnnrf"&gt;3090s are extremely rare now because they’re the only cards that guarantee the full hash rate and people are hunting them ... you could get them for maybe $1,800, $1,900, but a lot of them are currently $2,200, $2,300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="cqFD3D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the business changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7m15J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;Right now people are generally discouraged. A lot of buyers are really good at what they do and get cards regularly, but the rest find that upsetting, and we have to do mediation. “Why are these other people getting three cards a month?” It’s been getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i4YhM0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Getting graphics cards used to be so easy and we used to think it was so hard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ghR8c1"&gt;We’ve also been seeing more new people recently. People want to get a card for Christmas or they’ve been having issues with their funds for personal spending, so we’ve been seeing a trickle of people who’ve been gone for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmBEg4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu:&lt;/strong&gt; How we’ve adapted is by affiliating with more retailers ... Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop. We also expanded our product offering; we started tracking consoles. People on Twitter who had no followers started focusing on consoles last year, and now they have 100,000 or 200,000 ... we were really kicking ourselves wishing we’d done both GPUs and consoles. So we’ve diversified, we’ve broadened our scope, moving into computer parts and prebuilts because a lot of folks just want to tear into the GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="P7cC39"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you making a comfortable living?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW8w9Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m currently doing okay; I’m in a lower cost of living area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfqlaQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;We’re not filthy rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2LZTKW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD4sgL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu&lt;/strong&gt;: But we’re making enough that this is a comfortable income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8etp7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;I just bought a house, so I have something if I ever screw up bad enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="483ba9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stu: &lt;/strong&gt;Money-wise we’re doing okay, but we’re constantly 24/7 plugged in. Mentally it’s stressful on both of us. There could be drops at 3 or 4 in the morning ... If we had kids, we would not be able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LnU9A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry: &lt;/strong&gt;It requires constant interaction. If there’s a big drop, it’ll be several hours straight of typing responses. You feel nervous because you feel responsible, you want to give your customers maximum opportunity. If you mess up, you’ve ruined someone’s Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="R3L3bt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any last tips?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QR0iiA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Larry:&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest thing a normal person can have is determination. Most of these websites are &lt;em&gt;dying &lt;/em&gt;when you’re trying to check out. It can be five minutes later and you’ll have a card. A console at Walmart, it’s going to take an hour of trying before you’ll be sure that you’re not going to get it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuweC9"&gt;Amazon, try, try, try again, give it five minutes. Best Buy does waves, you have to try again. Try for an hour straight. The dedication is more important than how fast you can click, and that’s hard to convey to people. Even the little Javascript thing you put in on GameStop, the determination in running it again and again and again is part of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pq87pE"&gt;Why would you just click it once and think it must be gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpfzLg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoFf2N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jimmy Wales is selling his first Wikipedia edit as an NFT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A web page from January 15th, 2001 with the text “Hello, World!”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHjP5QNTlfFCy-XIVl11mdm-6V0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70223280/Hello__World_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jimmy Wales / Christie’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aFVzwO"&gt;Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales is selling a non-fungible token (or NFT) based on his first edit of the free encyclopedia. Auction house Christie’s will hold a sale of the token from December 3rd to 15th, auctioning it alongside the Strawberry iMac Wales was using around Wikipedia’s launch. The funds will go toward charitable causes and WT.Social, a donation-backed social network that Wales launched in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0fINh"&gt;Wales’ NFT is effectively the keys to a very early version of Wikipedia, which debuted in January of 2001. “What you see displayed is what Wikipedia looked like at the moment that I set up the software,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The single page will be launched publicly on the web, and much like Wikipedia itself, anyone will be able to see and edit it. But all changes will revert after five minutes, returning it to its original state: a single edit reading “Hello, World!” following a long-held tradition of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSft1t"&gt;The NFT, which is written to the Ethereum blockchain, encodes a smart contract that grants its buyer control over that website. The buyer can change the window for reverting edits, and if they really want, they can turn off editing or shut down the page. They can also take a completely hands-off approach and let Wales manage the page for them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Strawberry iMac owned by Jimmy Wales in 2001" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oblMNNJeksGtRXXsHCrk_oOan8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058274/Strawberry_iMac_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Jimmy Wales / Christie’s&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L63rOh"&gt;The project is conceptually similar to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557765/www-nft-tim-berners-lee-sothebys-source-code"&gt;earlier sale&lt;/a&gt; by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who tokenized the source code to the first web browser and donated the proceeds from its sale to charity. Wales could easily have sold control of the website without using blockchain technology, but he says he was compelled by the idea of publicly recorded and verifiable ownership. “I think what is specifically interesting is that for the first time, we have a publicly distributed, immutable kind of database, and that’s new and different,” he says. It likely doesn’t hurt that NFTs are a highly sought-after commodity that can sell at auction for huge sums —  Berners-Lee’s source code token earned him $5.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="kEcgDA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jcWaIN"&gt;Wales’ WT.social platform is an experiment in paid social networking, but not in the style of systems like Friends With Benefits that restrict access with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/nft-nyc-metaverse.html"&gt;high-priced cryptocurrency tokens&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free to join while encouraging members to pay for a subscription, akin to the patronage model of Wikipedia — a strategy aimed at removing the bad incentives that ad-supported services can create online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHxFur"&gt;Wales has an ambivalent overall relationship with blockchain technology. While the Wikimedia Foundation accepts donations in Bitcoin, he says the money raised through that “hasn’t been massive.” And he thinks many proposed applications of the tech to Wikipedia are misguided — like letting people pay editors for the “best” edits with cryptocurrency. “I’m like, yeah, that sounds like a great way to let Exxon control what the page says about Exxon,” says Wales. Similarly, permanent blockchain storage could make Wikipedia incredibly hard to censor, but it would also make removing abusive, libelous, or privacy-invading edits a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9b2SR"&gt;But Wales sees potential for NFTs to supplement the traditional ways artists make money, especially around internet culture. He points to examples of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html"&gt;meme images selling as NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, something that doesn’t affect their availability but helps subjects benefit from online fame in a way intellectual property law hasn’t so far. “People just share [memes], normally in ignorance of or in violation of any intellectual property rights — somebody uploaded a cool picture, and basically it went viral, and it’s everywhere,” he says. “It’s all very hard to enforce.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jbthRj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re still very, very far from mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REQTAU"&gt;Wales also draws parallels with the dot-com boom and bust of the late 1990s and early 2000s — a world where some companies failed because they were part of a hype-fueled bubble, while others simply launched with business models that weren’t yet technologically feasible. “We’re still very, very far from mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies,” Wales says, because of both its inconvenience and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;damaging climate effects&lt;/a&gt;. He notes that Ethereum, while it’s currently extremely energy-intensive, is supposed to move to a &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/"&gt;more environmentally friendly&lt;/a&gt; and potentially more user-friendly system. “I think as we move in that direction,” he says, “then suddenly a lot of use cases that people aren’t really considering will start to seem more interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atmU0I"&gt;For now, this NFT is supposed to offer a window back into the launch of Wales’ own internet-changing project. “The artistic concept is to take people back to that moment when I set up the website and had to think, ‘Gosh, this is so vulnerable. Like anybody can edit. It might just destroy the whole thing, and I’ll be taken over by trolls in five minutes,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3PDkd2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The artistic concept is to take people back to that moment when I set up the website”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeFdWh"&gt;Wales described precisely that experience at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCiqqJ0Y4z0"&gt;last month’s NFT.NYC convention&lt;/a&gt;, joking about how someone could mint an early version of the homepage that got defaced by trolls. Which raises a question: could anybody sell an NFT based on Wikipedia, an encyclopedia where all the content is freely licensed for reuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxL9Gn"&gt;“Because this is a personal kind of art project of mine that I’ve been noodling over, I specifically chose a moment in time before anybody else had ever touched Wikipedia because I didn’t want to have a feeling I was exploiting something,” Wales says. And if you implied an NFT was an official Wikimedia Foundation project, you could run afoul of trademark law. But otherwise, “with everything on Wikipedia, it’s freely licensed,” says Wales. “So if you want to do anything, you pretty much can.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft backtracks on Windows 11’s controversial default browser changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fhnby_BZOAB2PAw7YKJHNb7gqZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70223161/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktm8CE"&gt;Microsoft is backtracking on changes it made to Windows 11 that made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;more difficult to switch default browsers&lt;/a&gt;. A new test build of Windows 11 now allows users of Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers to set a default browser with a single button, which is a far simpler process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cs3Ihi"&gt;Rafael Rivera, developer of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17457778/eartrumpet-windows-10-audio-app"&gt;excellent EarTrumpet Windows app&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the new Windows 11 changes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of having to change individual file extensions or protocol handlers for HTTP, HTTPS, .HTML, and .HTM, Windows 11 now offers a simple button that lets people switch default browsers in a similar way to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcsPFB"&gt;Microsoft has confirmed the changes are intentional and are currently being tested. “In the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22509 released to the Dev Channel on Wednesday, we streamlined the ability for a Windows Insider to set the ‘default browser’ to apps that register for HTTP:, HTTPS:, .HTM, and .HTML,” explains Aaron Woodman, vice president of Windows marketing, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Through the Windows Insider Program you will continue to see us try new things based on customer feedback and testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ILoOeP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Windows build 22509 has a new browser [Set default] button.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/kRDFPKfJMv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kRDFPKfJMv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rafael Rivera (@WithinRafael) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hAwSON"&gt;Microsoft originally defended its decision to make it more difficult to switch defaults, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it was “implementing customer feedback to customize and control defaults at a more granular level.” Rival browser makers weren’t happy with the changes, however, and Mozilla, Brave, and even Google’s head of Chrome and Android criticized Microsoft’s approach to default apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqbwkk"&gt;While Windows 11 does currently offer a prompt when a rival browser has been installed, it’s only triggered when you click a link from outside a browser, try to open an HTML document, or attempt to access browser protocols and files. The prompt lets you open a file or link in a different browser, with a checkbox to always use this program. If you forget to check the box, you’ll have to dig into the settings app in Windows 11 and manually configure a bunch of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lw_-QJBtN2ck0NgMlDKHaSs6v-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789643/windows11defaultapps.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The default apps process as it exists in Windows 11 today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="znczlE"&gt;Microsoft is still testing these new Windows 11 changes that make it easier to switch default apps and browsers, but it’s not clear when they will be available to all users. We’re expecting to see these debut with a larger update to Windows 11 next year, but Microsoft hasn’t announced a release date and some features and updates are appearing ahead of the big annual drop of features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPzVZW"&gt;Still, it’s encouraging to see Microsoft listen to the criticism and feedback around its Windows 11 changes. This u-turn comes amid anger over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810595/microsoft-edge-zip-buy-now-pay-later"&gt;new built-in “buy now, pay later” tool&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft’s efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813733/microsoft-windows-edge-download-chrome-prompts"&gt;dissuade people from downloading Chrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7XsBiG"&gt;Five years after Jamal Hinton secured himself a seat at Wanda Dench’s thanksgiving dinner thanks to a wrong number, their story is being turned into a Netflix feature film, the &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-develop-a-feature-film-based-on-the-true-story-of-the-viral"&gt;streaming giant has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Thanksgiving Text&lt;/em&gt; will be written by Abdul Williams (&lt;em&gt;The New Edition Story&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Bobby Brown Story&lt;/em&gt;), but&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/thanksgiving-grandma-wrong-text-netflix-movie-1235124198/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that a cast or director are yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7FgGO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thanksgiving Text&lt;/em&gt; is the latest example of a film drawing inspiration from viral online content. Perhaps most notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082396/zola-thestory-viral-twitter-thread-film-review-sundance-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zola&lt;/em&gt; turned viral Twitter thread #TheStory&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082396/zola-thestory-viral-twitter-thread-film-review-sundance-2020"&gt;surprisingly good&lt;/a&gt; feature-length movie. This &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/9-movies-that-were-greenlit-because-something-went-vira-1719922611"&gt;2015 article from &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has plenty of other examples, including &lt;em&gt;Bad Ass&lt;/em&gt;, a film loosely based on the viral video “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Transit_Bus_fight"&gt;AC Transit Bus Fight&lt;/a&gt;,” and the fact that the original &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; may never have been greenlit if its leaked test footage hadn’t gone viral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="B3H39c"&gt;As ever, &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thanksgiving-grandma"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know Your Meme&lt;/em&gt; has the definitive rundown&lt;/a&gt; of Hinton and Dench’s viral story. But the short version is that in 2016, Jamal Hinton posted screenshots of a series of text messages in which Wanda Dench mistakenly invited him to thanksgiving dinner, thinking he was her grandson. “Can I still get a plate tho?” Hinton asked after revealing himself, only for Dench to respond, “Of course you can. That’s what grandma’s do... feed everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="druL3l"&gt;Hinton and Dench have since struck up a friendship and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jamalhinton12/status/1459982391108202498"&gt;continued to spend Thanksgiving together&lt;/a&gt; in the years since, with Dench now inviting Hinton’s girlfriend and family to the festivities. &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;notes that the pair have become minor internet celebrities, with over 150,000 followers on Twitter between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNsXSB"&gt;The two welcomed the news of Netflix’s adaptation. “We are excited to share our story with the world,” Dench and Hinton said in a joint statement. “We hope it inspires more people to reach out and make connections that they wouldn’t ordinarily make.  We are so blessed to find a genuine friendship brought together by God from a mistaken text message.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJd0EB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go now runs much smoother on iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HxmZAAvywDy4fcTyRFgHsKMdl5c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70222795/jbareham_160711_1134_0119_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9BSXK3"&gt;A new update to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; for iOS lets you run the game at higher frame rates. With version 1.191.0, the “advanced settings” section of the app now includes an option that reads “Unlock your device’s native refresh rate for higher FPS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBvPcj"&gt;I tried it out on my iPhone 13 Pro and it makes a huge difference. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the most visually complicated game, of course, but there’s a lot of scrolling and camera movement, and the smoother touch response feels a lot better when you’re lining up a pokéball throw with your finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEVyUa"&gt;Here’s how the feature appears in the game’s menu:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nHW_89zKBQfybEMNL-btA64PvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060153/IMG_1041.PNG"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LAgIfC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was previously locked to 30fps on iOS devices. Many Android phones are already capable of running the game at a higher frame rate, though in my experience testing across several devices the support can be hit and miss. Still, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; generally ran better on Android until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlPgzi"&gt;The new iOS feature isn’t limited to the 13 Pro and Pro Max, which are the only iPhones with 120Hz “ProMotion” displays. I also tried it on my old 8 Plus and it’s possible to unlock the frame rate there, too, though the aging A11 processor doesn’t always keep up a steady 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3P1tC"&gt;Niantic isn’t making a big deal out of the feature; it’s switched off by default and it isn’t mentioned in version 1.191.0’s release notes, beyond a vague mention of “various quality-of-life improvements.” It’s possible that enabling it for all users would cause complaints about battery life, considering that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is already a pretty heavy app in that regard. But if that’s not a concern for you, it’s worth giving the option a try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next N64 game for Nintendo Switch Online is Paper Mario</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hkudsv4xUNAMOZLg8Ji5hKs4wXs=/38x0:443x270/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70222637/Switch_NSO_Classics_DecUpdate_2021_PM_SCRN_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J5kujB"&gt;Nintendo launched its “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;Expansion Pack&lt;/a&gt;” for the Switch Online service back in October, which brought Sega Genesis and Nintendo 64 games to the library of playable retro titles. The first new addition has now been announced, and it’s just one game: &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll be available on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLNGiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt; was released for the N64 in 2000 and was the first entry in what became a popular spin-off series featuring Mario characters and RPG-style turn-based combat. The most recent game, &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario: The Origami King&lt;/em&gt;, came out on the Switch last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0YUOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Paper Mario: The Origami King is a laugh-out-loud funny RPG on the Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21324614/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u17UoS"&gt;The launch of Nintendo’s Expansion Pack was somewhat contentious. The $49.99 annual fee does also include a big &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; expansion, but it’s still a big hike over the regular $29.99 service that includes NES and SNES games, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad"&gt;quality of the N64 emulation&lt;/a&gt; has also come under scrutiny. While &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt; is a popular game, adding just one release at a time isn’t likely to change many people’s opinion of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwqIAV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Mario &lt;/em&gt;is one of a list of upcoming N64 games that Nintendo has already confirmed to be on the way. Others include &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will wait until the new year to make more return to office plans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwFkWeZXQOiE_X-82ZXA096OIJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221858/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e2KSsa"&gt;Google is reconsidering its return-to-office plans again, saying that its US employees won’t have to adopt a hybrid work model come January 10th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;as was previously indicated&lt;/a&gt;. A Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s current plan is to hold off on coming up with new plans until next year, with decisions regarding timelines still being left up to local offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQSa35"&gt;The company has changed its return to work plans several times as the pandemic evolved. In August, when the delta variant was a growing concern, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;we learned&lt;/a&gt; that the company intended to keep in-office work voluntary until at least January 10th, 2022. That plan itself was a change from a previous one that was revealed in December 2020, which would have had employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;returning in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsZbxO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As COVID has changed, so have company’s plans to bring employees back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBBe19"&gt;According to an email from Google VP Chris Rackow, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/google-workers-in-us-wont-return-to-office-as-expected-on-jan-10.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, the company reiterated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;a promise from August&lt;/a&gt; that full-time employees will be given a 30-day period to transition from working remotely to working in the office when the company does start to bring them back in. Google says it’s still intending to go with the hybrid workweek model that &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/"&gt;CEO Sundar Pichai outlined in May&lt;/a&gt;, where “most Googlers” will work three days in the office and two days remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsIPhY"&gt;The spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company has opened 90 percent of its US offices open for employees to come in on a voluntary basis. CNBC says Google is encouraging employees to come in “to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in the office more regularly.” Whether this will continue to be possible remains to be seen and will likely be dictated by the US’s response as more cases of &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/22813896/omicron-covid-variant-cases-hospitalizations-vaccines"&gt;the omicron variant&lt;/a&gt; of the coronavirus continue to pop up. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone stole $120 million in crypto by hacking a DeFi website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b98pZzeFq76X39-nlsKa2cyqTYY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70222064/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBShhQ"&gt;On Wednesday night, someone drained funds from multiple cryptocurrency wallets connected to the decentralized finance platform BadgerDAO. According to the blockchain security and data analytics Peckshield, which is working with Badger to investigate the heist, the various tokens stolen in the attack are worth about $120 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="nzpUIF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is the current whereabouts as well as the total loss: $120.3M (with ~2.1k BTC + 151 ETH)  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BadgerDAO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fJ4hJcMWTq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fJ4hJcMWTq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1466356911842856967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="622ou8"&gt;While the investigation is still ongoing, members of the Badger team have told users that they believe the issue came from someone inserting a malicious script in the UI of their website. For any users who interacted with the site when the script was active, it would intercept Web3 transactions and insert a request to transfer the victim’s tokens to the attacker’s chosen address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eF88vq"&gt;Because of the transparent nature of the transactions, we can see what happened once the attackers pounced. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1466294179676372992"&gt;PeckShield&lt;/a&gt; points out &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x951babdddbfbbba81bbbb7991a959d9815e80cc5d9418d10e692f41541029869"&gt;one transfer&lt;/a&gt; that yanked 896 Bitcoin into the attacker’s coffers, worth more than $50 million. According to the team, the malicious code appeared as early as November 10th, as the attackers ran it at seemingly random intervals to avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrW03F"&gt;Decentralized finance (or DeFi) systems rely on blockchain technology to let crypto owners perform more typical finance operations like earning interest via lending. BadgerDAO promises users they can “rest easy knowing you never have to give up the private keys for your crypto, you can withdraw anytime you like, and our strategists are working day and night to put your assets to work.” Its protocol allows people who have Bitcoin to “bridge” their cryptocurrency over to the Ethereum platform via its token and take advantage of DeFi opportunities they otherwise might not have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="ZfGr7Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For now, the pause on smart contracts continues in order to prevent further withdrawals. Badger will share further updates as soon as they are available.&lt;/p&gt;— ₿adgerDAO   (@BadgerDAO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO/status/1466535161709817857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QHo3st"&gt;Once Badger became aware of the unauthorized transfers, it paused all smart contracts, essentially freezing its platform, and advised users to decline all transactions to the attacker’s addresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="634tWo"&gt;Thursday night, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO/status/1466535158606086144"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; it has “retained data forensics experts Chainalysis to explore the full scale of the incident &amp;amp; authorities in both the US &amp;amp; Canada have been informed &amp;amp; Badger is cooperating fully with external investigations as well as proceeding with its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjGoNH"&gt;One of the things Badger is investigating is how the attacker apparently accessed Cloudflare via an API key that should’ve been protected by two-factor authentication. While the attack didn’t reveal specific flaws within Blockchain tech itself, it managed to exploit the older “web 2.0” technology that most users need to use to perform transactions. Multi-factor authentication systems protect our accounts against many phishing schemes or bulk credential stuffing attacks. Still, experts have &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/hacker-kevin-mitnick-shows-how-to-bypass-2fa/"&gt;repeatedly warned about targeted phishing attacks&lt;/a&gt; that can bypass it, while toolkits to automate the process have been available for years. An &lt;a href="https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/centers/cybersecurity/_docs/fbi_cyber_pin/2019/fbi_pin-20190917_multi-factor_authentication.pdf"&gt;FBI notice in 2019&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) called out criminals’ growing capabilities to bypass MFA and suggested changes or training that could make such attacks harder to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="6cIasl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘one of the most security minded teams in DeFi’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFQNsD"&gt;Getting two-factor authentication right can be tricky even within typical financial applications — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/5/5971989/the-internet-doesn-t-care-about-security"&gt;just ask PayPal&lt;/a&gt;. But incidents like this one, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619272/poly-network-attack-600-million-cryptocurrency-theft-doge-ethereum-binance-return-defi"&gt;the stolen-and-returned $600 million hijack that Poly Network suffered in August&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2016/6/17/11965192/ethereum-theft-dao-cryptocurrency-million-stolen-bitcoin"&gt;the $53 million heist that hit the first DAO ever&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, are hopefully enough to expand awareness of security beyond protocols and encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg0US5"&gt;One commenter within Badger’s Discord summed up the situation by saying, “All [the] blockchain / smart contract audits in the world, and people lose 120m to a Cloudflare API leak by a sloppy team where a dude passes a new approval to his contract in the site header - GG - we still have a long way to go.” A member of the team said, “I’m sure we will have some mitigation procedures proposed after this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3K1jNo"&gt;What funds can be recovered and how those affected will be made whole is still unknown. But for anyone living in the world of crypto, blockchain, and Web3 apps, it may ultimately be on them to learn how approvals, signing, and transactions really work and keep an eye on them. Particularly when millions of dollars in holdings can disappear in an instant even while managed by “one of the most security minded teams in DeFi,” as Badger refers to itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="psfhUZ"&gt;Were you one of the 53,000 attendees of the Anime NYC 2021 convention in New York City, or know someone who did? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1466473589180403714"&gt;New York City authorities&lt;/a&gt; and Anime NYC organizers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animenyc/status/1466549890947895300"&gt;are urging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;every single attendee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;exhibitor, artist, and staff member&lt;/em&gt; to get tested for COVID-19 — because one of the United States’ first confirmed cases of the new omicron variant was a man who attended the convention and likely caught it there (via &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-the-usas-first-omicron-cases-attended-big-anime-1848152747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YYpdrz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you attended the Anime NYC 2021 Convention at the Javits Center from November 18-22, get tested for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;➡️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/fESkqpcKQo"&gt;https://t.co/fESkqpcKQo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/niI8ENg3ez"&gt;pic.twitter.com/niI8ENg3ez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— City of New York (@nycgov) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1466473589180403714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Anime NYC team was notified today that one of this year’s attendees tested positive for the Omicron variant of COVID-19. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, the attendee developed mild symptoms on November 22, was tested on November 24, and their &amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AqpJuLIjTQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AqpJuLIjTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anime NYC (@animenyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animenyc/status/1466549890947895300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FW6jCv"&gt;Omicron is the new coronavirus variant whose first known US case made the news &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reports-first-case-omicron-variant-2021-12-01/"&gt;only yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, but is now &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minnesota-omicron-variant-case-rcna6909"&gt;also identified in&lt;/a&gt; California, Minnesota, Colorado and New York State as well, less than a week after &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html"&gt;being classified by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Several fully vaccinated people have tested positive. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/1466545026587111427"&gt;In a press conference today&lt;/a&gt;, New York governor Kathy Hochul said her state alone now has five confirmed omicron cases, and NYC mayor Bill de Blasio warned New Yorkers that they should assume there’s community spread. Hochul suggested that so far, all the US cases of the omicron variant have been minor, with very light symptoms; the man who attended Anime NYC has reportedly already recovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QON8gO"&gt;The man is from Minnesota; &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2021/covid120221.html"&gt;the Minnesota Department of Health says&lt;/a&gt; he had already been vaccinated, and developed mild symptoms the day after the convention. He hadn’t been outside the United States recently, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/us/minnesota-omicron-case.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting he may have gotten it at the convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um2Shu"&gt;“Anyone who attended the AnimeNYC conference, especially anyone experiencing symptoms, should get tested immediately and take additional precautions including social distancing,” reads part of a statement from de Blasio. “I urge all New Yorkers to get vaccinated, wear a face mask while indoors and in public, and help our city beat this virus once and for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
