    <title>Elon Musk co-authored a COVID-19 antibody study of SpaceX workers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KGzjQm"&gt;More that 4,300 SpaceX employees volunteered to be part of a COVID-19 antibody study co-authored by CEO Elon Musk in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ocuyw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-021-21336-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295821%2Fspacex-employees-covid-study-paper-antibody-research-elon-musk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, shows evidence that infected people who exhibited milder symptoms developed less of an immunity to COVID-19 than those who got sicker from the disease. The group behind the study found some evidence that suggests there’s a particular threshold of antibodies that could provide immunity, though they wrote that “the precise levels [...] associated with protection from re-infection remain unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmst0R"&gt;Vaccines also produce a much stronger immune response than cases with little to no symptoms, the authors note. They hope that this research, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/health/covid-vaccine-single-dose.html"&gt;other studies like it&lt;/a&gt;, could help policymakers figure out how to distribute limited vaccine supplies effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OI32Bo"&gt;SpaceX employees were asked by email in April 2020 to be a part of the study — right around the time that Musk was spreading dangerous misinformation about the virus in internal company emails and on Twitter. In March 2020, Musk told SpaceX employees in an email that he believed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179291/elon-musk-coronavirus-tesla-memo-car-accident-deaths-comparison"&gt;they were more likely to die in a car crash than of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, and that he didn’t see the virus being “within the top 100 health risks in the United States.” He also tweeted that same month that there would “probably close to zero new cases” in the US “by [the] end of April.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCWMle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;92 percent of the volunteers were male&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbvaLV"&gt;Nearly 500,000 Americans have died since. Musk contracted COVID-19 in November 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563590/elon-musk-tests-postive-coronavirus-pcr-antigen"&gt;said he experienced mild symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QErQut"&gt;The spaceflight company had its existing medical director — who oversees SpaceX’s budding human flight program — work with an infectious disease expert from Harvard and a doctor from the Ragon Institute &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-got-4-000-spacex-workers-to-join-a-covid-19-study-heres-what-he-learned-11613826001"&gt;to develop the antibody testing program&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. A group of 30 total co-authors from MIT, Harvard, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Howard Hughes Medical Center, SpaceX, and others collaborated on the study. The effort received funding from, among others, the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221173/elon-musk-tesla-foundation-philanthropy-wealthiest-person"&gt;Musk’s own charitable foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the Gates Foundation’s COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2020/11/Gates-Foundation-announces-new-funds-to-develop-COVID-19-vaccines"&gt;vaccine accelerator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/tri"&gt;NASA’s Translational Research Institute for Space Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFOkl9"&gt;The employees who signed up gave blood samples roughly every month. The paper’s authors note that 92 percent of the volunteers were male, and the median age was 31, which could skew the results. The full paper and dataset &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-021-21336-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295821%2Fspacex-employees-covid-study-paper-antibody-research-elon-musk" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available for free on Nature’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG denies the Rollable phone has been put on hold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TqQeaVOklqPzLrYnZIpT9moH_yE=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859280/LGRollable.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="71AgBO"&gt;LG Electronics has told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s phone with a resizable screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;the LG Rollable&lt;/a&gt;, has not been put on hold. “I can firmly deny that any such decision on future mobile products has been finalized,” says an LG spokesperson. The denial comes in response to &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210222005600320"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that LG had reportedly told parts suppliers that the Rollable had been put on hold and that they could request a refund for their development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO1AeI"&gt;Denying that a final decision has been made is not quite the same thing as reassuring everyone that the Rollable is still coming in 2021, but it could reflect the general uncertainty that comes with designing, manufacturing, and shipping complicated electronics during a global pandemic. And it could also be that the &lt;em&gt;Yonhap News&lt;/em&gt; report is somewhere near the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iidMdy"&gt;LG also firmly denied a report in January that it was planning to exit the smartphone business, and Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;TheElec &lt;/em&gt;wound up deleting that report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;only to see LG turn around later and admit that it was indeed considering an exit from smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, even if the decision hadn’t been finalized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cqafV"&gt;If LG did decide to put the Rollable on hold, it could be to change release dates or to re-engineer some part of its design. Not every change in manufacturing schedule necessarily means cancellation. It would probably come as a surprise to LG employees if it did get canceled, though: &lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;’s now-deleted story originally suggested that smartphone business or no, Project I (LG’s codename for the Rollable) would continue, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-not-shutting-down-smartphone-business/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgPYyP"&gt;LG has had a hard time competing with other smartphone makers like Samsung or Huawei, and its smartphone business has lost approximately $4.5 billion over the last five years. But it has seemed committed to making sure the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the last “unique” phone design it releases. The Rollable’s future is uncertain, but the story definitely isn’t over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLBw29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BATTGi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDHcEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejHZqN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Is1ek"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWy0oK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXKiuW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google has finally added iOS’s privacy labels to Gmail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDiTaGgRPH8tpV59gVwCp7BsgcU=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68859215/IMG_0879.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Pn0zK"&gt;Google has finally added Apple App Store privacy labels to its Gmail app, almost a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label"&gt;we ran an article wondering what was taking so long&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The app is the second major Google app to get the labels, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22282000/google-bug-fix-ios-youtube-app-privacy-apple-gmail-docs-search-update"&gt;they were added to YouTube&lt;/a&gt; when it was updated earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohaNAl"&gt;So how does it look? Well, that’s up for you to decide. The app apparently shares your coarse location and user ID with advertisers, as well as information about your interaction with advertisements. According to the privacy label, though, it doesn’t collect your name, physical address, or phone number (though as an email client, Gmail obviously collects your email address). Location data is also used for analytics and there are some features of the app that will request it as well. If you want to see the full label, there’s a video below that scrolls through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xqi01Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What does the app privacy label for Gmail look like? See for yourself. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LpOPfg4Iq2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LpOPfg4Iq2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1364014742419828743?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jIwgfq"&gt;For contrast, here’s the app privacy information for another email app, Hey. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIoCTNloyt8hSUXVNmV2j_Uazt8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22321818/IMG_0882.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information Hey requests fits on one page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="57dzTT"&gt;It is worth noting that Apple’s app privacy labels are meant to show all the things that the app &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; access, not what information that app &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; access. For example, an app may only use location data when it needs to show you a map, but the privacy labels don’t make that clear — it’s just a binary used/not used. Also, the information in the labels is submitted by the company itself, and Apple doesn’t make promises about its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59vquM"&gt;Strangely, Google added the labels without actually updating the Gmail app, even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277304/google-ios-apps-out-of-date-update-message"&gt;it was literally crying out for an update&lt;/a&gt; (because of a fun bug). The last time Google updated the iOS app was two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zzyIO"&gt;So far, Google’s other large apps like Maps, Photos, Docs, and Chrome haven’t gotten the labels yet. But the fact that both YouTube and Gmail have had them added indicates that Google is starting to roll them out to its bigger apps.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Starlink internet speeds will double to 300 Mbps this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ssh5y_HqBQk8flDyMaCEK7q7SOA=/426x0:2418x1328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858859/Screen_Shot_2020_09_03_at_10.38.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4g4FjE"&gt;Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite-based internet provider, will double in speed “later this year”, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?s=20"&gt;a tweet by Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, posted as a reply to someone who had just received their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536073/spacex-starlink-public-beta-testing-email-user-terminal"&gt;Starlink beta kit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-spacex-will-double-starlinks-satellite-internet-speeds-in-2021/?ServiceType=facebook_page&amp;amp;UniqueID=D7D4F968-7539-11EB-B2F4-9E263A982C1E&amp;amp;PostType=link&amp;amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0a&amp;amp;TheTime=2021-02-22T18:14:45"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com"&gt;currently promises speeds between 50 to 150 Mbps&lt;/a&gt;, and Musk specifically calls out a 300 Mbps goal in his tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Z4EGl"&gt;While 300 Mbps isn’t unheard-of speed, it’s faster than many people currently have access to, especially in the low-to-medium population density areas that Musk talks about targeting in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?s=20"&gt;a second tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4z4Yxo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Speed will double to ~300Mb/s &amp;amp; latency will drop to ~20ms later this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363763858121256963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="jAsFxM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then it’s about densifying coverage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1363774017606348802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MbHOoo"&gt;In the reply, Elon also tells the person that their latency should improve to around 20ms as well. In the speed test screenshots, their latency was at 34 and 44ms respectively, while Starlink’s website says to expect between 20 and 40ms during the beta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdLDn1"&gt;The speed increase and latency improvements should come as a nice surprise to anyone who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274385/musk-spacex-starlink-deposit-price-satellite-internet"&gt;put down a $100 Starlink pre-order&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s well known that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/8/7/20758944/elon-musk-twitter-tesla-funding-secured-private-420"&gt;Elon’s promises about the future should be taken with a grain of salt&lt;/a&gt;, especially if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13024542/elon-musk-spacex-mission-to-mars-preview-budget-schedule-nasa"&gt;they’re about timelines&lt;/a&gt;. Still, this shows that SpaceX is looking to speed up Starlink, and it might be able to keep pace with what’s available from a copper wire running to your house. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors is going public in a major SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGzfPBEZNRPgCMsbUSBai1eVL3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858569/akrales_170324_1554_A_0021.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LX5SBy"&gt;Lucid Motors is going to become a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in a deal that will leave the electric vehicle startup with $4.4 billion in cash. The California startup, which is majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, plans to start shipping its first luxury electric vehicle — the 500-mile range Air sedan — later this year. An electric SUV is slated to follow in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxUhx6"&gt;Much like many other startups in the automotive space have done over the past year, Lucid Motors is skipping the traditional path to becoming a publicly-traded company and is instead merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Lucid Motors is merging with Churchill Capital Corp IV, which is already listed on the NYSE. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; first reported that Lucid Motors and Churchill — which is run by investor Michael Klein, who has architected deals for Saudi Arabia in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;were in talks back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZLjky"&gt;Roughly $2.1 billion of that cash will come from Churchill. Some $2.5 billion will come from a new round of funding running concurrently with the merger, which is anchored by Saudi Arabia but includes BlackRock, Fidelity Management, and others. Some will go to fees, the rest will go to the newly combined version of Lucid Motors. The deal values Lucid Motors at $24 billion. It’s expected to close in the second quarter of this year, and Lucid Motors’ shares will trade on the NYSE under the ticker “LCID.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jibxp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lucid Motors is the latest EV startup to do a SPAC merger&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DMKFCk"&gt;Led by Peter Rawlinson, a former Tesla engineer who helped bring the Model S to life, Lucid Motors was founded way back in 2007 as Atieva. It was initially focused on battery technology, but ultimately pivoted into becoming an electric vehicle startup a few years ago. It has since grown to more than 2,000 employees and begun construction on a $700 million factory in Arizona where the Air will be built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvzIT1"&gt;Like many of its peers, Lucid Motors struggled for a time as it searched for new funding. Complicating matters was the fact that Jia Yueting, the founder of fellow EV startup Faraday Future, wound up owning around 30 percent of Lucid Motors. Jia became an obstacle in the company’s fundraising efforts, which &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;included solicitations from major OEMs like Ford&lt;/a&gt;. (Ford ultimately forged its own path into EVs, though it has supplemented that effort with a partnership with Volkswagen and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240212/ford-lincoln-cancel-rivian-suv-ev-coronavirus-pandemic-investment"&gt; an investment in buzzy EV startup Rivian&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyAqOr"&gt;In the meantime, Lucid Motors turned to hedge funds for loans to keep the lights on, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17757218/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-funding-tesla-billion"&gt;using its intellectual property as collateral&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nphkv"&gt;Lucid Motors eventually found a savior in Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, or PIF. PIF pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder"&gt;more than $1 billion to Lucid Motors in 2018&lt;/a&gt; (just a few weeks shy of the slaying of Jamal Khashoggi) in exchange for majority ownership in a startup that aligned with the clean energy ambitions touted by the Kingdom’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF0WB7"&gt;According to the investor presentation published Monday, PIF currently owns 85 percent of Lucid Motors following a new injection of $600 million that is supposed to sustain the startup until the SPAC deal is closed. Jia is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511540/silicon-valley-foreign-money-china-saudi-arabia-cfius-firrma-geopolitics-venture-capital"&gt;reportedly now out of the picture&lt;/a&gt;, and Faraday Future is one of the many other EV startups to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;announce a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzc5hj"&gt;Since then, Lucid Motors has been hard at work prepping the tech-forward luxury Air sedan for its debut. The car leverages the company’s long history in battery technology to deliver more than 500 miles of range, which would make it as capable as Tesla’s most advanced Model S sedan. Lucid Motors also plans to sell it directly to customers, much like Tesla and other EV startups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmNHu8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unlike other EV startups, Lucid Motors has a long history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bBOz2C"&gt;That battery tech is one reason Klein’s SPAC is investing so deeply into Lucid Motors, according to the investor presentation. Lucid Motors has “untapped potential in battery storage solutions and powertrain technology licensing,” the companies write. They imagine the batteries specifically being used in everything from commercial vehicles, to helicopters or drones and other aircraft, and heavy equipment, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jU46vU"&gt;The investor presentation also talks up Lucid Motors’ growing cache of executive talent. That includes former Apple VP Michael Bell, who helped bring the iPhone into the world. Bell was previously CTO of Rivian until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21143374/rivian-cto-mike-bell-left-apple-intel"&gt;he abruptly left last February&lt;/a&gt;. Former Tesla executives Peter Hochholdinger (manufacturing) and Peter Hasenkamp (supply chain) are also among Lucid Motors’ executive ranks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AC4i4n"&gt;Lucid Motors believes it can generate gross profits as soon as 2023, which is when its first SUV — called Gravity — will debut, and to get truly into the black by 2025. It expects to be able to make and sell 20,000 cars in 2022, 49,000 in 2023, and as many as 500,000 cars a year (including the Air, the Gravity SUV, and future models) by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sp65Yt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is bringing back Twisted Metal... as a TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vk0oCLWqIPpJD2lywHB0MeFlLtU=/0x100:1322x981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68858065/Twisted_metal.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal Wiki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dXeJYE"&gt;Sony is bringing back its &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;franchise, but this time it’s going to be a TV show, not a video game. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/twisted-metal-tv-series-deadpool-writers-1234911825/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the show is moving ahead in its production, with the writers of &lt;em&gt;Deadpool&lt;/em&gt; and actor Will Arnett signed on as executive producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5i8WA"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; games center mainly around getting in a heavily armored car and blowing other drivers up. The series, which the head of PlayStation Productions calls “one of the most beloved franchises from PlayStation,” started on the original PS1 and got releases on the PS2 and PS3 as well (though my personal favorite was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal:_Head-On"&gt;the PSP version&lt;/a&gt;, which I sunk hours upon hours into). The series went dormant during the years of the PlayStation 4, however, with no signs of a console comeback any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JztXeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The show will be going for a comedic (but probably not lighthearted) tone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9NcR4f"&gt;The show’s plot synopsis reads like a cross between &lt;em&gt;Mad Max &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Death Race&lt;/em&gt;, with a car thief and vague protagonist having to fight down highways to deliver a package. It’s also rumored to include Needles Kane, the terrifying clown whose face or ice cream truck (named Sweet Tooth) grace the cover of pretty much every game in the series. If you’ve been bummed that &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal: Apocalypse &lt;/em&gt;never saw the light of day, maybe this TV show will scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpQjMW"&gt;While the idea for the series seemingly came from Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who wrote the &lt;em&gt;Deadpool &lt;/em&gt;movies, the actual writing was done by &lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/em&gt;’s Michael Jonathan Smith. It seems like the show will be going for a comedic (but probably not lighthearted) tone, with Sony Pictures’ Glenn Adilman, the company’s executive vice president of comedy development, calling the script “action-packed [and] brilliantly funny.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXSpdb"&gt;The return to the property comes after a long drought: the first &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;game came out in 1995, and the most recent one was released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3. It’s a bit strange that Sony is making a television show about a franchise that hasn’t seen a release in almost a decade — especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261214/destruction-allstars-playstation-5-ps5-sony-interview-cars-demolition-derby"&gt;one of the flagship PS5 games is &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same theme of vehicular violence. That’s not to say that &lt;em&gt;AllStars &lt;/em&gt;should’ve been a &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;game, just that it might be a bit awkward if the &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; show and &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; were stopped at a red light next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDwCgS"&gt;It’s unclear when the show will come out, but it probably won’t be any time soon — it seems like it’s just now cleared to start production. It’s also worth noting that Sony has tried to make a &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt; movie before, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2012/02/ghost-riders-brian-taylor-in-7-figure-sony-deal-to-writedirect-twisted-metal-movie-231020/"&gt;which was announced in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://collider.com/twisted-metal-movie-update-brian-taylor/#nicolas-cage-sweet-tooth"&gt;the man who was supposed to have directed&lt;/a&gt; it said that it fell apart because Sony didn’t want to spend the amount of money needed to make it feel like, well, &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal&lt;/em&gt;. Hopefully the show will get the budget, otherwise fans may wish they had heeded the lesson &lt;em&gt;Twisted Metal &lt;/em&gt;games always end on: be careful what you wish for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9xXVA"&gt;If and when the show starts hitting screens, it’ll likely be part of Sony’s first wave of PlayStation-based film and television content, including the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21583442/hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show-playstation-neil-druckmann-craig-mazin-series-order"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Of Us&lt;/em&gt; HBO show&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; staring Tom Holland and Antonio Banderas. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish is confident in its plan to offer 5G in its first major cities by end of Q3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dish CES 2013 stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUOO-ApGg_rdiEWhLHLSttCGaH8=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857966/20130110-625A1517VERGE.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QclUa4"&gt;Dish Network co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen underscored the company’s commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;building a 5G wireless network&lt;/a&gt; on today’s Q4 2020 earnings call. He restated the intention to bring 5G online in its first major cities by the end of Q3 2021 — that’s the period running from July through September — and was bullish on Dish’s ability to boost the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;somewhat dismal global position&lt;/a&gt; in terms of wireless network offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px7YNP"&gt;Ergen spent several minutes on &lt;a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yi3fxcbb"&gt;today’s call&lt;/a&gt; recapping what the company has done so far in its network-building effort. With its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquisition of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s currently offering prepaid service as an MVNO on T-Mobile’s network, but it has also been accumulating its own spectrum to make the move to a full-fledged carrier. That’s a good sign for wireless competition in the US; with Sprint no longer available as a choice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;Dish is positioned to step up&lt;/a&gt; as a fourth major carrier option. And it kind of has to in order to satisfy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;the conditions of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PchgGb"&gt;To that end, Dish made low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum purchases last year, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/c-band-assignment-phase-kicks-off-february-8"&gt;estimated to have spent $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the recent C-band auction. With access to these different kinds of spectrum, Dish has the pieces of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;5G “layer cake”&lt;/a&gt; that will help it establish fast service with wide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PnayvP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"},{"title":"The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287683/iphone-12-pro-max-5g-sales-adoption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lKc9dQ"&gt;“This isn’t our first rodeo,” Ergen said, stressing his confidence in the company’s ability to execute, despite the considerable risks. He didn’t stop there either; Ergen believes Dish can “help the United States actually start leading again in wireless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUHguA"&gt;Maybe he’s right. There’s a big challenge ahead of Dish, but the company doesn’t face one of the challenges plaguing the major carriers right now: keeping 4G data flowing while adding 5G. This has led Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, to turn to a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;poor results&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the bar is quite low at the moment for US networks, which might help Dish get a running start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-XyU5rsEElrPRnqeZ6FTPpJqdU=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67448810/twarren_200909_4177_0030.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update February 22nd, 2021 4:55PM ET: The Xbox Series S is currently available at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733050721171570442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $299.99. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296076/xbox-series-s-restock-best-buy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out, and if you missed out on preordering either (or both — look, I’m not going to judge), you might be able to snag one online soon. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6AgAag"&gt;Last November, Microsoft debuted two next-gen consoles — the Xbox Series X and the more affordable Xbox Series S. If you are looking for the more affordable next-gen Xbox, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733050721171570442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the console in stock right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyA4VQ"&gt;The Xbox Series S variant costs $299, is smaller, and is less powerful than the $500 Series X. One other important thing to note is the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive to play physical games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RsBijG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QU1oLf"&gt;If you plan to buy this console, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tp76dt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv0OUa"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0on2NA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WaqSo8"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B0wXAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SpaceX announces second crew member of its all-civilian space mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A white woman with long, light brown hair smiling and standing with her arms crossed in front of a wall painted with planet earth and a star." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNtxvTpv0HtoNYnyARwKu09fNGg=/1x0:1200x799/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857769/Hayley_Arceneaux.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hayley Arceneaux | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.stjude.org/inspire/series/st-jude-cancer-survivor-hayley-arceneaux-hope-inspiration4-worlds-first-all-civilian-space-flight.html" target="_blank"&gt;St. Jude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tgA4N"&gt;Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, will join the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;first all-civilian trip to space&lt;/a&gt;, SpaceX announced today. She will orbit Earth for up to five days in the Crew Dragon capsule as part of the Inspiration4 mission. Crew members are being selected based on “mission pillars of leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration"&gt;press release for the mission&lt;/a&gt;. Arceneaux, SpaceX said, will represent hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HZeny"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/science/spacex-hayley-arceneaux.html"&gt;Diagnosed with bone cancer at 10&lt;/a&gt;, she had some of the bones in her left leg replaced with titanium as part of her treatment. She was treated at St. Jude, where she now works with children who are being treated for lymphoma and leukemia. With the upcoming mission, Arceneaux will become the first person with a prosthetic body part to go to space.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPVAN1"&gt;The mission is slated for late 2021 and if all goes as scheduled, Arceneaux, at 29 years old, could also be the youngest American to go to space. The title of youngest person in space would still go to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/gherman-titov-bad-boy-cosmonaut-turned-elder-statesman-of-space/"&gt;Gherman Titov&lt;/a&gt;, a cosmonaut who was 25 when he orbited Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc85sQ"&gt;The selection process for crew members also involves a fundraising effort for St. Jude, with a sweepstakes where people can donate to St. Jude for chances to be the third member. The fourth crew member will be the winner of a contest sponsored by the billionaire Jared Isaacman, who is funding and commanding the mission. &lt;/p&gt;
