    <title>T-Mobile’s home office internet is a separate cellular-based Wi-Fi network for enterprise customers</title>

  &lt;p id="22ZIL3"&gt;T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Funprecedented-times-meet-the-un-carrier-t-mobile-unveils-big-moves-for-businesses&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313560%2Ft-mobile-enterprise-home-office-internet-5g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced some new services&lt;/a&gt; for enterprise customers today, including wireless Home Office Internet. Part of a trio of services T-Mobile is calling WFX, Home Office Internet is designed to complement customers’ standard home internet with a separate cellular-based Wi-Fi network. The goal is to provide a reliable, secure connection for business customers without having to worry about sharing bandwidth with the rest of the household. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mV9Kd"&gt;Home Office Internet is an extension of the LTE-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;wireless home broadband consumer service&lt;/a&gt; that’s being piloted now, and it works in basically the same way. Users receive a router and can self-install the network. It uses 4G and 5G signals and, like the consumer service, includes a potentially important caveat: customers are subject to deprioritization slowdowns at times when the network is busy. That’s an annoyance for anyone but would be particularly bad for customers trying to conduct business on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUSuHp"&gt;Home Office Internet will be available to businesses starting March 22nd, and at launch T-Mobile says 60 million households will be covered. The company aims to expand that to 90 million households by 2025. T-Mobile didn’t share any updates on the consumer home broadband service, which remains in testing in certain markets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s moonshot lab is working on a device to give people superhuman hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gZVl1Fv4fsPzQIBNNGqm32VJVGM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911891/acastro_180130_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jfsUUg"&gt;Alphabet has attempted to take on some wild projects over the years, like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21513353/alphabet-google-x-lab-moonshot-computational-agriculture-mineral-revealed"&gt;crop-sniffing plant buggy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161029/tidal-moonshot-sustainable-fish-farms"&gt;fish-tracking cameras&lt;/a&gt;. But now, its X lab is working on a device that could give people superhuman hearing. As &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-x-alphabet-hearing-project-wolverine-codename-augmented-reality-2021-3?international=true&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt;, the project, codenamed “Wolverine,” is exploring the future of hearing through sensor-packed hardware. The team, members of which spoke to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; anonymously, say they’re currently trying to figure out how to isolate people’s voices in a crowded room or make it easier to focus on one person when overlapping conversations are happening around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Su9XxP"&gt;They’ve already iterated on the device multiple times, including devices that covered the whole ear and others that protruded from above the ear. These iterations have been large because the team incorporates lots of microphones into the build, but newer versions are smaller, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;says. Multiple people from hearing technology companies have joined the team, including talent from Starkey Hearing Technologies and Eargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBb93v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says the Wolverine team’s goals most closely align to that of &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/whisper-announces-35m-series-b-to-change-hearing-aids-with-ai-and-subscription-model/"&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt;, a company that came out of stealth last year. That team has managed to isolate sounds through a “sound separation engine,” which adapts to wearers’ environments. This suggests the lab’s goal isn’t to just create a device everyone would want, but rather an enhanced hearing aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJaBh7"&gt;Alphabet’s team isn’t focused on just one device or one use case, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says. The team is looking to build a successful business with multiple devices and models, so if they’re successful, you might start wearing Google-owned hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have PS5 and Xbox Series X restocks available today </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qs7kgLsOEhwKsUYeWKWCzsOZ_wM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911732/vpavic_4261_20201023_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Due2Rh"&gt;Both the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X / S gaming consoles will be back in stock at Walmart later today. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the consoles available for purchase again at 11:30AM PT /  2:30PM ET for the Xbox Series X / S and  12PM PT / 3PM ET for the PS5. As usual, stock will likely not last very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hp1rKY"&gt;Walmart plans to have inventory for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles, with prices ranging from $300 to $500 depending on the model you purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jDvaI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6H8DPb"&gt;If you plan to buy a PS5 console, there are a few additional items you should pick up to get the most out of your new console. I recommend picking up a second &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is necessary for any in-person multiplayer action. I suggest that early adopters also subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you a few perks, such as access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zo7xb2"&gt;No option to expand PS5’s SSD, but it is likely coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwqpDB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2xum71"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzvvrT"&gt;If you are buying either an Xbox Series X or Series S, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt; is likely a good purchase. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenHaystack is a new open-source tool that lets you create DIY AirTags on Apple’s Find My network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OpenHaystack" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWv4gZcgIkCpqVS0u4KSp5A2mEM=/155x0:1748x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911699/OpenHaystack_Screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzuy7b"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;promised to open up its Find My app to third-party accessory makers&lt;/a&gt;. But ahead of that, there’s a new tool that will let anybody make their own Bluetooth tracking tag to use with the Find My network so they can track its location. &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack#installation"&gt;OpenHaystack&lt;/a&gt; is a new open-source tool developed by security researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/seemoo/index.en.jsp"&gt;Secure Mobile Networking Lab&lt;/a&gt;, who have essentially reverse-engineered the way Apple devices register themselves to the Find My mesh network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEZeQU"&gt;It is, in short, a way to create your own DIY AirTags today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zlLXv"&gt;OpenHaystack works via a custom Mac app that can be used to track the location of custom tags that you create. As of right now, the tool has direct support to make a tracking tag using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910685/bbc-micro-bit-final-design-giving-away-to-kids"&gt;BBC micro:bit mini computer&lt;/a&gt;, though other Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device support could be added by other developers in the future. Once registered on Apple’s Find My network, the OpenHaystack app will be able to report the tag’s location just like Apple’s Find My app works for iPhones and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvYYZC"&gt;The whole system is a bit of a hack — in the sense that it’s complex, not in the sense that it’s actually hacking anything. It uses a plugin for Apple Mail (which authenticates you as a genuine Apple user) to get the necessary access to Apple’s Find My network to create and locate the keys — so Mail needs to be running for OpenHaystack to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPS6sM"&gt;There don’t appear to be serious security implications for the Find My network itself, either (though the team has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849"&gt;submitted other bug reports to Apple&lt;/a&gt;). That doesn’t mean you should just go ahead and start using OpenHaystack, however. There’s an important disclaimer on the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XbBH78"&gt;OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack tags using our &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="GB48S3"&gt;A high-level understanding of how the security model for Find My works also helps understand why OpenHaystack is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToMNk7"&gt;Find My works by using a combination of public and private keys. Any Apple user can access the public keys for devices in the Find My network, but you need the private key in order to actually access location information. This means not even Apple can access your location information without your private keys. The network is possible because Apple devices communally track the public keys, but only users can get location data from private keys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="How OpenHaystack gets on the FindMy network" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbLNvcqV7Wz51mhNC1yaLl405Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345345/FindMyOverview.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OpenHaystack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How OpenHaystack gets on the Find My network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n70MOz"&gt;What OpenHaystack does is create one of those public / private key pairs for your own Bluetooth tag and uses Apple Mail to register it in the Find My network. To Apple, it just looks like another iPhone. The Mac app then accesses the public key database, pairs it with the private key you created, and bam: secure location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byvR9j"&gt;From the way it’s designed, it seems like it might be difficult for Apple to cut off OpenHaystack easily without also cutting off a bunch of older Apple devices. However, it’s also surely true that Apple as a company won’t like the whole thing and may try to find a way to block it. A developer could use the system to create a way to add Android devices to the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnABVp"&gt;The team behind OpenHaystack has written a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02282"&gt;paper detailing its methods&lt;/a&gt; and disclosing a now-fixed security flaw. It also released the &lt;a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware"&gt;source code for its firmware&lt;/a&gt;, which other developers could use to adapt OpenHaystack to other BLE devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhvZGZ"&gt;Apple’s &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; support for third-party accessories is still coming. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-AUC002%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313461%2Fopenhaystack-apple-find-my-network-diy-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Belkin has already announced a set of earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that will support Find My. Given how complex the setup of OpenHaystack is, it probably won’t gain mass adoption. It’s similar in some ways to AirMessage and Beeper, two tools that use Mac utilities to redirect iMessages to Android devices. Apple’s ecosystem is locked down in any number of ways, but the Mac finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TTDZk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge gets a speedy startup feature and vertical tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zY-MrbIlFQelBwXBgl55xWO5FU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911586/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IysseP"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out some new improvements to its Edge browser this month. While the software maker announced vertical tabs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199819/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-feature-chromium"&gt;nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is finally making its way to all Edge users this month. You’ll be able to stack tabs at the side of the browser instead of the traditional long list of tabs at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9B0b4"&gt;The vertical tabs feature looks ideal for 16:9 screens, and you can click to switch between tabs or group some together. It arrives just weeks after Microsoft implemented a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242622/microsoft-edge-new-themes-icons-sleeping-tabs-feature"&gt;sleeping tabs feature in Edge&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a large amount of tabs open. This prevents Edge tabs from hogging memory and CPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAL6kyE4ZaTVsng3d3C7TTmwbsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345218/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Vertical_Tabs_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Edge vertical tabs feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="52NsHz"&gt;Microsoft is also improving the startup experience for Edge this month. A new startup boost feature is rolling out that makes browser launches up to 41 percent faster after rebooting a device. “Initial tests show startup times improve from 29 percent to 41 percent with this feature,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=175340"&gt;says Liat Ben-Zur&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft executive working on the company’s “Modern Life” initiative. “Startup boost will be automatically enabled this month and you can access your browser settings menu to personalize Microsoft Edge even more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUUyLZ"&gt;If, somehow, you’re still using Bing and haven’t switched to Google, Microsoft is also improving how search results work from Edge. Results for popular searches like recipes will soon include improved visuals. Big topics like “giraffes” or “Kenya” will also aggregate visual results into an infographic at the top of search results. These new search results should be available in the US in the “coming weeks,” according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Bing search results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BDOWbx"&gt;Finally, Microsoft Edge users will also see a new history view in the browser this month. When you navigate to history it will soon drop down from the toolbar instead of heading into the settings section. It should be a lot easier to search, open, or manage search history now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exclusive: this is the Sonos Roam, coming in April for $169</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDEzk874ZwErdjzHLonwzBpJ7LQ=/1x0:903x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911425/SonosRoamWM2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u8tSWb"&gt;You’re looking at the first images of the next speaker from Sonos. Set to be priced at $169, the new device — it’s called the Sonos Roam — is much smaller than the Sonos Move, which was the company’s first foray into portable speakers. This product has a much closer resemblance to popular, take-anywhere Bluetooth speakers like the UE Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxuupx"&gt;According to a source with direct knowledge of the Roam, it measures 6.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches and weighs around a pound. It will come with a USB charging cable, and a wireless charging dock will be sold separately for $49. Like many of the company’s other speakers, the Sonos Roam will be available in either black or white. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-IWbxALXY8TM46kJO-XIeBW8To=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345374/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_11.49.00_AM.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSlA9X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Sonos for comment. The new speaker first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;popped up in a Federal Communications Commission filing&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Sonos has confirmed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287135/sonos-event-date-announced-bluetooth-speaker-headphones"&gt;will announce a new product on March 9th&lt;/a&gt;. Current plans call for the Roam to ship a month later on April 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EKCeV"&gt;Like the Move speaker, the Sonos Roam will be able to play audio over both Wi-Fi (when at home on your regular Sonos system) and Bluetooth on the go. On Wi-Fi, the Roam will function like any recent Sonos speaker as part of a multi-room system. It runs on the company’s S2 platform that rolled out last year. There are built-in mics for hands-free voice commands for either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, and AirPlay 2 is supported as well. Two Roams can be stereo paired when in Wi-Fi mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWBfnX"&gt;Battery life is expected to be around 10 hours on a full charge, and the Roam is fully waterproof, which will help it compete against the similarly-rugged competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP3Ucj"&gt;With the Roam, Sonos will expand its lineup of multi-room speakers to go well beyond the home. The Move’s hefty weight made it impractical for taking anywhere beyond short trips to a backyard or porch, but the Roam will fill the role of a true travel speaker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas cold snap froze cleanup efforts at some Superfund sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Houston Area Begins Slow Recovery From Catastrophic Harvey Storm Damage" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f64RZnJq04anVajNGMsDNcTl5Hc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911067/842561422.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NiWCTT"&gt;Texas’ deep freeze was the latest warning that extreme weather events threaten to derail efforts to clean up the most toxic sites in the US. In a worst-case scenario, a natural disaster can unleash buried toxic substances. But even minimal damage or the mere threat of a storm can stop or slow cleanup efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prRtP7"&gt;That vulnerability could become a bigger problem as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/superfund-sites-climate-change/index.html"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; brings about more weather-related disasters. For years, experts have pushed the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare for the onslaught. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBbhAh"&gt;“We have over two dozen Superfund sites here in our county, and we are one of the most threatened coasts in the world by natural forces,” says Jackie Young-Medcalf, executive director of the Houston-based nonprofit Texas Health and Environment Alliance. “As long as the waste remains in place … It’s at risk for impacts from Mother Nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hIH48o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Superfund sites lost power or preemptively stopped operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3WTCZ"&gt;Efforts to control hazards at some toxic Superfund sites in Texas temporarily halted as a result of the deep freeze that battered the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; in February. Superfund sites are places so polluted that they were placed on a National Priorities List for cleanup. Several of these sites lost power or preemptively stopped operations during the freeze, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. At least four sites sustained minor damage like cracked pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mV8OtB"&gt;After winter storms knocked out power and water systems, the EPA assessed 16 Superfund sites in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana for problems. The damage it found didn’t lead to any contaminants being released, the EPA told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9hSAw"&gt;But the storms did manage to freeze some Superfund operations, at least temporarily. One of the Superfund sites that Young-Medcalf’s group has monitored over the years, the Jones Road Groundwater Plume in Harris County, was damaged during the recent cold snap. The EPA found leaking valves and ruptured pipes and fittings at the site following the winter storms. The affected equipment will come back online after repairs are made, the agency said. And short-term lapses in operations at the site won’t affect the long-term strategy for containing or cleaning up hazards, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vg7IH1"&gt;In the meantime, residents are anxious for cleanup operations to resume.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s certainly slowing down the cleanup process because the unit is not fully operable, you know, it can’t perform,” says Young-Medcalf. “What that ultimately means is that the plume of vapors that [the treatment system] was once extracting from is sitting there, largely undisturbed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cnptmF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disasters have put Superfund sites — and surrounding neighborhoods — in peril&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sS64T6"&gt;Jones Road was polluted by a dry cleaning business in a strip mall. Chemicals the business used from 1988 until it shut down in 2002 wound up contaminating nearby private water wells with tetrachloroethylene, also called perchloroethylene (PCE). PCE in drinking water has been &lt;a href="https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/srp/1/ResearchBriefs/pdfs/SRP_ResearchBrief_247_508.pdf"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a higher risk of epilepsy and cancer in people exposed in early childhood. Since then, &lt;a href="https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.cleanup&amp;amp;id=0605460#Done"&gt;cleanup&lt;/a&gt; has involved plugging up wells and pulling vapors from contaminated soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16bG28"&gt;Disasters have put Superfund sites — and surrounding neighborhoods — in peril in the past. Hurricane Harvey’s flood waters broke a protective cap at the San Jacinto Waste Pits in 2017, releasing cancer-causing chemicals, dioxins, into the nearby river. Like many Superfund sites, the prescription for addressing pollution was to contain it on site. But after the protective cap failed during Harvey, the EPA &lt;a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2017/10/12/242068/epa-announces-115-million-cleanup-for-san-jacinto-waste-pits/"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to remove the chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oci2nR"&gt;“There’s not anything that man can make that is going to withstand the changes of this river and the forces of Mother Nature that go on there,” Medcalf-Young says. The issue now is that removing the chemicals from San Jacinto will take at least &lt;a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2020/08/26/380447/cleanup-of-san-jacinto-river-waste-pits-now-estimated-to-take-7-years/"&gt;seven more years&lt;/a&gt;. And with storms growing stronger because of climate change, time is working against cleanup efforts. “Seven more years is seven more hurricane seasons,” Medcalf-Young says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aH13Nf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Seven more years is seven more hurricane seasons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCfJ8r"&gt;That’s one of the more daunting problems facing already established Superfund sites. Strategies to clean up and contain these sites were likely designed to address weather-related risks the location has faced in the past, says Jim Blackburn, an environmental law professor at Rice University. But climate change is creating new normals that remediation plans might not have taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6DdMo"&gt;“We’ve seen 100-year rain fairly often around here. These terms have lost their meaning because we have so many severe rainstorms,” Blackburn says. “We’re facing something that’s changing going into the future. And I don’t think we’re very good at understanding how to evaluate that, address it, and plan for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMl2lY"&gt;Superfund sites are evaluated &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-five-year-reviews"&gt;every five years&lt;/a&gt; if the location still has contaminants at high levels. That’s when the EPA will consider if any changes need to be made because of any additional risks posed by climate change, a spokesperson for EPA’s Region 6 office, which includes Texas, said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnZBHC"&gt;“The Agency’s new leadership team is aware of the issues involved in climate change and Superfund sites, and will be working with EPA staff to determine next steps to build on the Superfund program’s existing climate change approaches,” a spokesperson for EPA headquarters said in an email. It’s a reversal from the EPA’s approach under former president Donald Trump, when leadership &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-s-epa-claimed-success-superfund-cleanups-climate-change-went-n1242435"&gt;backtracked&lt;/a&gt; on previous efforts to incorporate climate change into the agency’s work.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4EJ4B"&gt;About 60 percent of all non-federal Superfund sites are in places where they’re vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, sea-level rise, and wildfires made worse by climate change, according to a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-73"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Government Accountability Office. That report didn’t investigate how those events or other challenges might delay cleanup, but it’s something the agency is interested in looking into in the future if Congress makes an inquiry (the GAO conducts investigations at the behest of Congress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWZ840"&gt;“You can imagine that if an area is flooded and inaccessible, that whatever cleanup might have been going on is suspended,” says Alfredo Gómez, director of natural resources and environment at the GAO. He says the agency would like to look into what kinds of challenges affect the pace and scheduling of Superfund cleanups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYg5GT"&gt;“Now we know that our future from climate change is going to be potentially affected by more frequent and intense storms,” says Gómez. “How can we still ensure that these sites are going to be more protected?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qCg48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ55mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Sound certification promises a big wave of hi-fi wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYmtmgMJkh3S_NtAqBK-cxAZl80=/1x0:1365x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911041/snapdragonsound.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLEf74"&gt;Qualcomm today announced Snapdragon Sound, which is what the company describes as “a chain of audio innovations and software” that work together to significantly improve audio quality when listening to music through wireless headphones, earbuds, and other devices. The goal is to deliver “high-resolution, wired quality audio, wirelessly,” according to James Chapman, Qualcomm’s VP of voice, music, and wearables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2fNbs"&gt;Snapdragon Sound takes advantage of the company’s latest processors, Bluetooth audio SoCs, and codecs like aptX Adaptive to achieve playback of hi-fi music up to 24-bit 96kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R54EyN"&gt;The concept of high-quality wireless audio isn’t new to Android; Sony has been largely pushing that mission forward with its own LDAC technology, which can transmit up to three times the amount of data that the standard SBC Bluetooth codec is capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UU7lYy"&gt;But Qualcomm’s components are found in headphones and earbuds from many companies — Bose, Jabra, 1More, Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Anker, and more — and the Snapdragon Sound badge will appear on the boxes of both audio products and smartphones that support this HD audio chain. Existing devices won’t be updated to support it; the first Snapdragon Sound products are expected in the next few months. Xiaomi and Audio-Technica have been announced as the first two Snapdragon Sound partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP2FQr"&gt;Aside from making it easier to enjoy hi-res music, Qualcomm says Snapdragon Sound focuses on improved, clearer voice call quality and lower latency when playing games — down to 89 milliseconds. Connection stability is also a priority, with the company promising minimal dropouts and glitches even in the busiest wireless signal environments. Qualcomm claims “Snapdragon Sound optimized devices will be tested for interoperability in Qualcomm Technologies’ dedicated test facility on measures of performance including audio quality, latency, and robust connectivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqn2d3"&gt;One thing that Snapdragon Sound &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; particularly focus on is multipoint pairing for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. The feature has become fairly common for wireless headphones, but Jabra is pretty much the lone earbud maker to offer it. We’ll have to see if that changes with this next wave of products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx0o6W"&gt;Today’s announcement of Snapdragon Sound follows Spotify’s recent news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;it will offer a lossless streaming tier&lt;/a&gt; later this year as an add-on for Premium subscribers. Amazon Music already offers an HD streaming option, as do Tidal, Qobuz, and other music services. Good audio is always heavily dependent on the source, so you’ll need one of those services to get the most from Snapdragon Sound when it begins reaching products. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pOfyP1"&gt;General Motors is considering building a second battery factory in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-looking-to-build-second-battery-factory-in-u-s-11614853806?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, in order to ramp up its production of electric vehicles in the interest of becoming a completely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIwiS0"&gt;The factory would be built in collaboration with LG Chem, the South Korean battery maker that is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996866/gm-lg-ev-electric-vehicle-battery-joint-venture-chem-lordstown"&gt;working with GM on a battery factory&lt;/a&gt; in northern Ohio. According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the second facility is likely to be located in Tennessee, though a final location has yet to be selected. A spokesperson for GM confirmed that a second factory is being discussed with LG Chem, and a decision is expected sometime in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJHAu6"&gt;GM announced the construction of its first battery factory in December 2019. The automaker set up a joint venture with LG Chem, with the two companies committing to spend $2.3 billion on a new facility located in Lordstown, Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aRH7Kl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM is increasingly staking its future on electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Gb0hh"&gt;GM, the largest automaker in North America based on sales, is increasingly staking its future on electric vehicles. The company has vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. GM even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;redesigned its logo&lt;/a&gt; to look more like an electrical plug to emphasize its pivot to battery-powered vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h3nEL"&gt;LG Chem is a major supplier of lithium-ion batteries to automakers like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and their respective parent companies Volkswagen Group and Daimler. Many of these automotive giants have plans to either build their own battery factories in the future or partner with suppliers to build batteries together, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18305976/tesla-panasonic-gigafactory-batteries-model-3"&gt;Tesla does with Panasonic&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has also announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;bring its future battery production in-house&lt;/a&gt;, and it recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fe50829f-045b-4134-9089-4b650c544d91"&gt;a deal with a major producer of nickel&lt;/a&gt;. But until those factories are built, they’re at the mercy of suppliers like LG Chem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSBkAh"&gt;The auto industry as a whole is slowly shifting to electric vehicles, and if the US wants to compete with the rest of the world, it needs to ramp up its supply of locally produced EV batteries in addition to other crucial components in the supply chain. SK Innovation, another South Korean company that supplies batteries to Volkswagen and Ford, began construction on its second US-based factory in July in Georgia with production aimed for 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQeuV5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;President Joe Biden recently signed a series of executive orders&lt;/a&gt; aimed at combating climate change, including the electrification of the federal government’s fleet of vehicles. The new administration has provided an opportunity for GM to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;fully embrace the electrification of its vehicle lineup&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;shrug off its past support&lt;/a&gt; of former President Donald Trump’s effort to allow passenger vehicles to pollute more.&lt;/p&gt;
