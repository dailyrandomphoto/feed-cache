    <title>Android apps are crashing for some, but Google is working on a fix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naDA8Nsuq_s656I6Ht2zbSxi95Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009525/wjoel_180413_1777_android_002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iUh0l6"&gt;Some Android apps are crashing for some people right now, but Google is working on a fix. The issue is due to a system component &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.webview"&gt;called Android System WebView&lt;/a&gt; that lets Android apps display web content, but it has some kind of problem right now that is causing apps to crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODHH6q"&gt;“We are aware of an issue with WebView causing some apps on Android to crash,” Google &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-gmail-stop-running-webview-234125352.html"&gt;said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We are currently working to fully validate the scope and a fix is in progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUFqjV"&gt;Some users are saying that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/19Watty87/status/1374130850518945798"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; the latest update to WebView should fix the issue — and in fact, Samsung’s official US support Twitter account recommends &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/milanbear0609/status/1374122986870083584"&gt;taking that exact step&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iki3I2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hi! Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Please remove the Webview Update and then restart the phone. Here are the steps: Go settings &amp;gt; apps &amp;gt; tap the three dots in the top right corner &amp;gt; show system apps &amp;gt; search for Android System WebView &amp;gt; select Uninstall updates. ^Nina&lt;/p&gt;— Samsung Support US (@SamsungSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungSupport/status/1374124081843343361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFELlo"&gt;Google also acknowledges issues with Gmail on Android on the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=issue&amp;amp;sid=1&amp;amp;iid=aa75515d184a2423be444d676b7ebf45"&gt;Google Workspace status page&lt;/a&gt;. The company recommends using the desktop interface until issues are resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH6mKL"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvU4Fo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now tell the FCC just how broken the internet is for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mp-CIRTBZE5yPDn1aImJRYi78o=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009435/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p8BoOq"&gt;It’s not at all controversial to say that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;internet service sucks in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. As part of its plan to update coverage maps in the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in a break from tradition, is finally asking average Americans &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData/consumers"&gt;to report which internet services are &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; where they live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsoJRq"&gt;In the past, the FCC has made these coverage maps&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt; with self-reported data&lt;/a&gt; from the ISPs themselves, an inherently compromising decision because internet service providers will naturally want to paint the rosiest picture possible. Since the FCC uses these maps as evidence for proposed regulation, it can seriously hinder the FCC’s ability to make sure there’s actual competition in the market and that the internet is being responsibly distributed. For instance, a map might show that you have 11 broadband providers when you actually only have one or two real options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qrWrkY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Take note. We're going straight to consumers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/bZzsFo46ap"&gt;https://t.co/bZzsFo46ap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1374093168816369672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0DXp9"&gt;Now, the FCC will finally go to the people actually using the internet to learn what’s up, though you may need to communicate clearly to be heard. &lt;a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001440131"&gt;The form the FCC is using for your responses&lt;/a&gt; is decidedly rudimentary; it looks like a general complaint form, and doesn’t ask any specific questions about broadband at all (the only reference is in the header). But the FCC says it’s a stopgap on the path to a more detailed and specific reporting tool. For now, perhaps you can take a look at &lt;a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/"&gt;the FCC’s current crappy maps at your address&lt;/a&gt;, and tell the FCC whether you actually have the kinds of choices that the ISPs claim you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbwtmn"&gt;Hopefully, once the Broadband Data Task Force finishes collecting these new data points, we’ll have more accurate maps that show the worrying reality of American internet, and be able to do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam can now stream games at 8K resolution and we immediately thought of you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nhk super hi-vision hero" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpl0zNa9UbcVugLsqLwdNRWVibo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009321/DSC01926.1419978978.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An early 8K TV set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2H4Mdk"&gt;I just realized: I never came back to thank you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/11/27/21723138/samsung-98-inch-tv-deal-sale-black-friday-8k"&gt;for buying that $30,000 8K television&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, I’m sure the $1,500 coupon helped? But I feel like I still owe you a bit more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vfawb"&gt;How about this: why not be the first to stream PC games at 8K resolution to the other end of your mansion? When we saw that Steam &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/steam/?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;amp;emgid=3006688962897471639"&gt;now supports that feature&lt;/a&gt;, we immediately thought of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISnlQW"&gt;Imagine the possibilities: you could sit down on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18170575/kohler-konnect-bathroom-smart-gadgets-numi-intelligent-toilet-ces-2019"&gt;your fully immersive $9,000 toilet&lt;/a&gt; with your backup 8K TV — as you do — and instead wasting so many of those glorious pixels on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;a pillarboxed Snyder Cut&lt;/a&gt;, you can use all 33+ million of them to sling some not-terribly-demanding game at 8K resolution from your blinding rainbow death box of an RTX 3090-equipped gaming PC, without even disturbing its sanctum at the other end of your house!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHxo2W"&gt;You’ll likely &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; that level of PC, of course, and even then 8K may not be a given. “Results may very depending on hardware,” reads Valve’s release notes. I would also suggest a wired Ethernet cable to reduce latency, and you might want to unlock your bandwidth limiter in Steam &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Remote Play &amp;gt; Advanced Client Options too — because 50Mbps may not cut it at 8K resolution. You’d know better than us, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWrIqVt4BYr5Lk5vSPqmIGkFqxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22390373/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8K Remote Play is now available in the stable Steam client, after coming to the beta a few days ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4cRpbr"&gt;In all seriousness, it’s pretty cool to see Steam getting prepped for the TVs of the future. And please send us a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;high resolution photo of your setup if it’s your TV of now, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1zFb5"&gt;On the other hand, if you’re the kind of person who can’t afford new games much less an 8K TV or high-end gaming PC, Valve has good news for you as well — the company just brought Steam Remote Play Together URL sharing out of beta, so friends can send you a link to join their local multiplayer games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300768/steam-remote-play-together-no-account-required-beta"&gt;even if you don’t have a PC or a Steam account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pikmin is the next AR game from the makers of Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qq-W4prKzzLKpAHXV4Nd-NaaLpU=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69009287/Niantic_Nintendo_Pikmin_app.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Niantic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AjIMq3"&gt;Niantic, developer of the smash hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, has announced a new partnership with Nintendo. The first new game from the collaboration will be a mobile augmented reality game based on Nintendo’s popular &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and it will launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyLthC"&gt;Details are thin right now, &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/nintendo-apps-partnership/?hl=en"&gt;but Niantic says that&lt;/a&gt; “the app will include gameplay activities to encourage walking and make walking more delightful.” If you want to receive more information about the new game as it’s available, &lt;a href="https://nianticlabs.com/newappsignup/"&gt;you can sign up here&lt;/a&gt; to get updates. The new &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; AR game will be the first developed by Niantic’s Tokyo Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0mavJQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're overjoyed to make new memories with our partners at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; and YOU!    Imagine exploring the world through the wonder of AR and alongside all of your pals - including your new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pikmin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pikmin&lt;/a&gt; friends! Learn more about our partnership here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/TiQ10S8kMR"&gt;https://t.co/TiQ10S8kMR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/YUpp4P33NA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YUpp4P33NA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Niantic, Inc. (@NianticLabs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NianticLabs/status/1374148894028873729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psSbcs"&gt;“Niantic’s AR technology has made it possible for us to experience the world as if &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; are secretly living all around us”, Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210323.html"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Based on the theme of making walking fun, our mission is to provide people a new experience that’s different from traditional games. We hope that the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; and this app will become a partner in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfadaI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; franchise is all about exploring a very Earth-like planet with packs of the adorable Pikmin creatures, so a Niantic-made &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; game about walking and exploring the world around you makes a lot of sense. The latest game in the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; series is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355506/pikmin-3-deluxe-nintendo-switch-release-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch’s &lt;em&gt;Pikmin 3 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an upgraded version of the 2013 game first released for the Wii U.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilQOxk"&gt;Niantic didn’t say what other games it will be making with Nintendo, but it sounds like the two companies have secured some kind of long-term partnership. “We’re honored that Nintendo has chosen Niantic to be its publisher of real-world AR applications,” Niantic said. More details about upcoming apps will be revealed “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5nAEJ"&gt;Niantic is best-known for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the hugely popular mobile AR game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12113802/pokemon-go-release-date-us-ios-android-app-available"&gt;released in July 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The game is still quite popular despite being nearly five years old, although Niantic has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;make some changes&lt;/a&gt; to the game while many have been staying inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;due to the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Those changes didn’t stop &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; from generating money hand over fist, however — 2020 was the game’s biggest year yet, surpassing $1 billion in revenue as of November, according to &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020"&gt;app analytics firm Sensor Tower&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder will soon let you gift a Lyft ride to your date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxzsNXZl4qw3hrOdQ87El9bWae0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008916/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cED3A4"&gt;Tinder is partnering with Lyft to offer the ability &lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item=122493#assets_all"&gt;to gift rides to dates without having to leave the Tinder app&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small convenience if you already have the Lyft app downloaded, but like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248548/tinder-video-chat-launch-update"&gt;adding video chat in the app&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one less reason to switch your focus away from your match and to another app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRuyy2"&gt;There’s no firm release date for the Lyft integration other than it’s “slated to roll out in the coming months” and Tinder has no visuals to share yet for how it will work in the app. Tinder does say that Lyft’s usual safety features like location sharing with family and friends will be available from the Lyft app for gifted rides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL44lT"&gt;Adding Lyft rides could be convenient, but there are some potential scenarios to be concerned about. It’s not clear at what point you’re able to order a ride, or whether both you and the person you matched with have to agree. It would be annoying (not to mention a little unsettling) for both the person you matched with in Tinder and the Lyft driver if you called a ride and they didn’t actually want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKYh2M"&gt;When asked for more details, Tinder declined and said more information would be available in the coming months. Until then, Zoom dates or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250995/tinder-trivia-live-test-launch-interactive-video-feature"&gt;Tinder’s built-in trivia feature&lt;/a&gt; might be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrOZf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s new Mars rover is about to spawn a tiny helicopter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ingenuity’s debris shield lies beneath Perseverance | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R9tli5"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover is getting ready to deploy a mini-helicopter named Ingenuity on Mars. The four-pound, four-blade rotorcraft will attempt the first flight of its kind on another planet, and in the process, it will test a new mode of mobility that could transform the way we Earthlings remotely explore other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49iGBX"&gt;The craft is currently attached to the belly of Perseverance, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; at Mars’ Jezero crater in February. One of the first steps toward setting the baby helicopter off on its debut flight came this weekend when Perseverance dropped a protective shell and exposed Ingenuity to the bright Martian sunlight for the first time. “Away goes the debris shield, and here’s our first look at the helicopter,” the rover’s Twitter account said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3sQxvf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Away goes the debris shield, and here’s our first look at the helicopter. It’s stowed sideways, folded up and locked in place, so there’s some reverse origami to do before I can set it down. First though, I’ll be off to the designated “helipad,” a couple days’ drive from here. &lt;a href="https://t.co/E9zZGQk5jQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/E9zZGQk5jQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1373708912281542665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e4I2nG"&gt;After dropping the debris shield, Perseverance will spend a couple of days driving itself to Ingenuity’s flight zone, which NASA officials plan to unveil in a press conference on Tuesday. The helicopter will be lowered to the ground, and Perseverance will scoot away to a safe distance of about 330 feet, leaving Ingenuity to unlock its rotor blades and carry out a few spin tests. NASA expects the first test flights to come “no earlier than the first week of April,” a statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="301QvM"&gt;The artificial boundaries of the flight zone, wherever it is, will be a 50-foot-long oval patch of land that Ingenuity will need to stay within during its flight tests. Perseverance will drop the helicopter off near one end of this flight zone, in a space engineers call the helipad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7wuKz"&gt;Deploying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21339544/nasa-mars-helicopter-ingenuity-perseverance-rover-flight-date"&gt;the first&lt;/a&gt; helicopter on Mars is no easy task. Ingenuity’s team of engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had to account for a Martian atmosphere 100 times thinner than Earth’s, which means the craft needs to work much harder than Earth-bound helicopters to lift itself off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Njtg1v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every step is something to celebrate because nothing is a given”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OfEPed"&gt;And it’s not just a more powerful toy drone: Ingenuity is an $85 million spacecraft built to withstand an extremely turbulent ride to Mars — from the violent rumbling during liftoff from Earth last summer to Perseverance’s seven-minute landing sequence through Mars’ atmosphere in February. Its design also has to comply with the international 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which requires signatories to ensure their spacecraft don’t contaminate environments on other planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqUgOf"&gt;“This was a design challenge that straddled both the aircraft and spacecraft boundaries,” says Bob Balaram, Ingenuity’s chief engineer. The team’s biggest challenge, he said, was creating a craft that can spin its blades fast enough to generate thrust, while keeping the overall design simple and lightweight — “otherwise whatever lift you generate doesn’t do any good if you’ve gotten too heavy in the process in the design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f6eRM"&gt;Packing all that power in the craft’s four-pound body is made possible by a rectangular solar panel installed above the craft’s four carbon fiber blades. That panel also holds a tiny telecommunications device that can communicate with a node on Perseverance’s body called the Mars Helicopter Base Station, even from as far as nine football fields away.  The Base Station will help relay signals back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C2Oa0B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ingenuity will lie on the Martian surface for eternity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F4QETJ"&gt;Beneath the blades is a tissue box-sized fuselage that houses flight sensors, two cameras, batteries, and mini “survival heaters” that protect Ingenuity from freezing during nighttime on Mars, where temperatures drop as low as negative 130 degrees Fahrenheit. One of the two cameras has a 13-megapixel color camera facing the horizon that will snap and send images to Perseverance mid-flight (the other camera has a 0.5-megapixel black-and-white sensor used for navigation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0n5p5e"&gt;In all, Ingenuity will attempt to carry out five flight tests within a short, 30-day window. If the tests work, similar helicopter tech could be used in other missions, to trek places where wheeled rovers can’t reach, like caves, tunnels, or mountaintops. Ingenuity won’t fly again after its 30-day window, even if the tests are wildly successful. That’s because “we are being accommodated by a major flagship mission that’s got a huge, new astrobiology exploration ahead of it,” Balaram says. Perseverance’s primary mission is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316093/nasas-perseverance-rover-first-drive-mars"&gt;explore&lt;/a&gt; Mars’ Jezero crater and pack soil samples into tiny, cigar-sized sample tubes that the rover will scatter around the surface for a future “fetch” rover to send back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbETgz"&gt;After that 30-day window, Ingenuity will lie on the Martian surface for eternity. If the craft’s first flight attempt doesn’t work out, Balaram said his team can still celebrate a number of achievements they’ve already made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40OWLq"&gt;“I think the main thing is, we’ve already achieved a lot of milestones just by having a design that could do all of these things, and we have had a successful test program so far,” he said. “Every step is something to celebrate because nothing is a given. It’s a fairly high-risk, high-reward type of activity. And tech demos are inherently a quite risky venture, they’re not a slam dunk.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Richard Stallman returns to the Free Software Foundation after resigning in 2019</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xQcI_yhsEYSyIUUNtZaiEwwYKo=/0x86:2164x1529/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008630/Screen_Shot_2021_03_22_at_11.05.09_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LibrePlanet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pU27sb"&gt;Open-source software advocate Richard Stallman is rejoining the board of the Free Software Foundation. Stallman founded the FSF in 1985 and acted as its president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870050/richard-stallman-resigns-mit-free-software-foundation-epstein"&gt;until 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when he resigned after making widely criticized statements about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqNsw2"&gt;Stallman announced the news &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/1373905399707955202"&gt;during a live stream&lt;/a&gt; for the FSF project LibrePlanet. “Some of you will be happy at this, and some might be disappointed, but who knows?” he said. “In any case, that’s how it is, and I’m not planning to resign a second time.” He also mentioned that the announcement was meant to be made with a more formal video, but that “it didn’t get finished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPXNCm"&gt;Stallman resigned from the FSF, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870050/richard-stallman-resigns-mit-free-software-foundation-epstein"&gt;a position at MIT&lt;/a&gt;, after participating in an email conversation about &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scientist-richard-stallman-described-epstein-victims-as-entirely-willing"&gt;MIT’s leadership and its ties with Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/a&gt;. Stallman defended MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed"&gt;allegedly had sex&lt;/a&gt; with one of Epstein’s trafficking victims — saying “the most plausible scenario” was that Minsky had been unaware the woman was being coerced and she would have “presented herself to him as entirely willing.” The exchange was posted online, sparking calls for him to step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZmeLA"&gt;Stallman &lt;a href="https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jul-oct.html#14_September_2019_(Statements_about_Epstein)"&gt;denied defending Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, saying he wished he “could’ve prevented the misunderstanding.” But for some critics the problems &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794"&gt;went beyond that exchange&lt;/a&gt;, covering other statements and actions he’d made over his years in the open-source software community, where critics said he’d created &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88"&gt;a hostile environment for women&lt;/a&gt;. MIT graduate Selam Jie Gano, who posted the original emails on Medium, called the Epstein statements “almost irrelevant” to the larger issue. “This was about real life actions, not only online words,” wrote Gano &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794"&gt;in an update&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nN8Raf"&gt;Even after his resignations, Stallman remained in charge of the GNU Project, which develops and advocates for free and open-source software and operating systems. As referenced in the famous &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/linux"&gt;“I’d just like to interject” copypasta&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"&gt;a blog post by Stallman&lt;/a&gt;), the GNU utilities have been instrumental in the history of Linux, and the FSF has a similar function, acting as a nonprofit to advocate for free and open software. It publishes the GNU General Public License, under which many open-source projects are published. After being away from its leadership team for over a year, Stallman has returned to help run the FSF. The FSF wasn’t immediately available to provide comment on Stallman’s return or what role he will play on the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft rebrands Xbox Live to Xbox network</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ddmRo2OP7DilKgcwwrj4q8XRHc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008528/xbox_live_1280.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KHEpwd"&gt;Microsoft is rebranding Xbox Live to Xbox network. Instances of the new branding started appearing in the Xbox dashboard recently for beta testers, with clips being uploaded to “Xbox network” instead of Xbox Live. Microsoft has now confirmed the name change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVbi3S"&gt;“’Xbox network’ refers to the underlying Xbox online service, which was updated in the &lt;a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fservicesagreement&amp;amp;data=04%7C01%7Calexis.crofts%40assemblyinc.com%7C094de9662ca64e088b0208d8ed5e29c2%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637520336003048746%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;amp;sdata=Bp37ZUQU5G%2BIyqTGXisJA%2BfmuchnPzK%2F31zNfvmSTmE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;Microsoft Services Agreement&lt;/a&gt;,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The update from ‘Xbox Live’ to ‘Xbox network’ is intended to distinguish the underlying service from Xbox Live Gold memberships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DYK03"&gt;Microsoft has used Xbox Live to refer to its underlying Xbox service since its original launch 18 years ago. Larry Hryb, better known as Major Nelson, has been known as “Xbox Live’s Major Nelson” for years, but Hryb now refers to himself as “Xbox’s Major Nelson.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2ertIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox network   &lt;a href="https://t.co/E49QQzQFad"&gt;https://t.co/E49QQzQFad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OQS1cRsrZ2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OQS1cRsrZ2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1373458474898706433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh39u4"&gt;Hints at a name change originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355756/microsoft-xbox-live-rename-gold-free-rumors"&gt;appeared back in August&lt;/a&gt;, after Microsoft updated its Services Agreement. At the time, Microsoft said it wasn’t rebranding the service and had no plans to discontinue Xbox Live Gold. Instead, Microsoft went on to announce a price hike for Xbox Live Gold that the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-reversed-f2p"&gt;forced to quickly reverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGfsFe"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to drop the subscription requirement for free-to-play games on its Xbox network in the coming months. Games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;will no longer require Xbox Live Gold as a result, but Microsoft hasn’t yet confirmed exactly when the paywall will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon threatened warehouse workers organizing amid COVID-19 pandemic, says US labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggV_SB8VTw06IuLRYUbxpQdV3rw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008497/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nv0dDf"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found merit to the claim that Amazon threatened and retaliated against workers protesting the company’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an NLRB complaint &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8ngk/amazon-interrogated-worker-who-led-first-covid-19-strikes-nlrb-says"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The case, which centers on a warehouse in Queens, New York, was settled before it went to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyJ0x4"&gt;The NLRB investigation found that warehouse managers may have violated US labor law on four accounts, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports. During the pandemic, they allegedly instructed employees not to organize without first notifying them, interrogated workers about the walkout, and threatened to discipline those who spoke to colleagues about the protests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1HT77"&gt;The complaint reportedly said that Amazon illegally interrogated and disciplined Jonathan Bailey, one of the lead walkout organizers. He coordinated a protest after a colleague tested positive for COVID-19 — the first time this had happened at an Amazon facility in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqbGUp"&gt;The day after the walkout, a regional manager interrogated Bailey for an hour and a half, telling him his behavior might constitute harassment, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports. He also demanded Bailey alert him in advance of any future protests. A week later, Bailey was written up for harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulzBui"&gt;“Amazon did its best to keep everybody working while simultaneously crushing our effort to fight back,” Bailey told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlvBxY"&gt;He’s not alone in this assessment. In February, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/technology/amazon-new-york-lawsuit-covid.html"&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the company&lt;/a&gt; for failing to provide adequate safety measures and retaliating against workers who raised concerns. The case is focused on the Queens warehouse as well as a facility on Staten Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t99dUR"&gt;The NLRB has separately found merit to allegations of retaliation from warehouse workers in Chicago, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Employees say they were retaliated against in the wake of protests regarding how the company handled the COVID-19 crisis. The US labor board is reportedly in the process of negotiating a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKNf57"&gt;The news comes amid a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;historic union vote&lt;/a&gt; at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. Workers began voting by mail on February 8th. Votes will be counted on March 30th. If the effort is successful, it’ll be the first Amazon union in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcrEAH"&gt;Amazon is disputing the results of the NLRB investigation. “While we disagree with allegations made in the case, we are pleased to put this matter behind us,” said spokesperson Leah Seay, in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The health and safety of our employees is our top priority and we are proud to provide inclusive environments, where employees can excel without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This USB-C gadget from hell brings back the worst part of USB-A</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gp_C2T5JLl28DIh5pVJILBmhwcI=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69008479/Ew_iOliWQAEs1eJ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/mifune/status/1373565157759156226/photo/2" target="_blank"&gt;Pim de Groot (@mifune) / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r8U7yG"&gt;USB-C ports, I am occasionally forced to admit, are somewhat confusing. Different standards, different charging speeds, different data and video capabilities, proprietary labels like Thunderbolt, all on top of identical-looking plugs — it can be a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj9Xu9"&gt;But one thing that USB-C ports had going for them was a solution for one of the biggest annoyances of USB-A — it’s no longer possible to insert a USB cable the “wrong” way, thanks to the symmetrical design of the plugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qu8Vph"&gt;Or, at least, it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, until mechanical engineer Pim de Groot came along with a USB-C gadget from hell, which &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; behave differently depending on which way your USB-C plug is facing. And I hate it so, so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BZrSEj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’ve made a Cursed USB-C 2.0 device. It behaves differently based on the orientation of the plug. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8Ko66wPuV2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8Ko66wPuV2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pim de Groot (@mifune) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mifune/status/1373564866443759617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JX8MB8"&gt;The device itself is rather simple: when the USB-C cable is plugged in one way, a green LED lights up on the top of the device. Plug it in reversed, and the bottom LED lights up green, a malevolent horror balefully blazing out in a sea of black silicon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VEy88"&gt;What unearthly science has birthed this horror? Well, as de Groot explains, USB-C plugs aren’t &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; symmetrical — there’s a set of contacts that are only used when connecting plugs as a USB 2.0 device that’s only found on one side of the plug. And when you connect a plug to use in a USB 2.0 setting, you apparently can take advantage of that to create de Groot’s cursed device above, which uses a pair of microcontrollers that each only light up when they detect those contacts. (USB-C 3.0 connections apparently are immune to the trick, thankfully.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="GzviUN"&gt;Unfortunately, instead of viewing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mifune/status/1373565157759156226"&gt;de Groot’s eldritch sigil-etched monstrosity&lt;/a&gt; as a cautionary tale, some developers are looking to take things even further &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1368736720133398530"&gt;by trying to intentionally build a USB-C cable&lt;/a&gt; that requires a “superposition” maneuver of constantly unplugging and replugging it in different orientations before it successfully works. For the sake of all that is good in this word, we can only hope that these efforts fail to come to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Laughing_Man?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Laughing_Man&lt;/a&gt;, is there a way for a Type C cable to detect rotation? &lt;br&gt;I want to to make a Type C cable that implements “Type A mode” so it never works until you have unplugged &amp;amp; rotated it at least twice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m don’t see any orientation indicator possibilities from host :( &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z8v8E8KQzy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z8v8E8KQzy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— _MG_ (@_MG_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1368736720133398530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
