    <title>Google Calendar will break down how much of your work is spent in meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Calendar Time Insights" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/roNyGY4HlndIIi2jBKRNGfmboOU=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69797079/time_insights.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9SQkck"&gt;Google is adding a new “Time insights” panel to Calendar on the web, showing users how much of their working week is spent in meetings. According to &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/better-understand-how-youre-spending.html"&gt;Google’s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the feature is rolling out gradually over the next month on select plans. It was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307087/google-workspace-status-meet-calendar-frontline-split-screen"&gt;back in March&lt;/a&gt; as part of a raft of new features coming to Google Workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOMhZm"&gt;Time Insights arrives a couple of years after both Google and Apple added similar breakdowns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17426922/apple-digital-health-vs-google-wellbeing-time-well-spent-wwdc-2018"&gt;into Android and iOS respectively&lt;/a&gt; to show the amount of time spent using different apps. But while these OS features included the ability to set per-app time limits, Google Calendar won’t let you set similar boundaries on meetings. Instead, it provides you with the information you need to hopefully curb any meeting-obsessed colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ttB7xE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This information is visible to you, not your manager”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fnkbpb"&gt;A screenshot published by Google shows what kind of insights the panel will provide. Up top there’s a “Time breakdown” pie chart, showing how much of your working hours are spent in meetings, which is subdivided into meeting between just two people, versus bigger groups of three or more. Below there’s a snapshot of time spent in meetings on a week-to-week basis, as well as highlights of which days are busiest, and the average hours per day spent in them. Calendar entries where you’re the only attendee don’t count towards these meeting totals, Google notes in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/10738043#:~:text=has%20at%20least%20one%20other%20guest."&gt;a support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWxARq"&gt;Google emphasizes that “this information is visible to you, not your manager.” However, it adds that it might be possible to see another person’s breakdown if you have permission to manage their calendar. The feature will be on by default, and while it can be turned off by Workspace admins, it can only be minimized, not disabled, by end users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wi4yKQ"&gt;Time insights is available for users on the Google Workspace Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, and Nonprofits subscription tiers. However, it won’t be accessible for G Suite Basic and Business customers, or those on Google Workspace Essentials, Business Starter, Enterprise Essentials, Education Fundamentals, and Frontline tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google must allow developers to use other payment systems, new Korean law declares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6vtfjWbmqr8esuAJJkmBtb-Xlvc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796907/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="blzh29"&gt;South Korea has passed a bill written to prevent major platform owners like Google and Apple from restricting app developers to built-in payment systems, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-apple-hit-in-south-korea-by-worlds-first-law-ending-their-dominance-over-app-store-payments-11630403335?st=dh3dbi4h20et6lc&amp;amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The bill is now expected to be signed into law by President Moon Jae-in, whose party championed the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIrgCu"&gt;The law comes as a blow to Google and Apple who both require in-app purchases to flow only through their systems, instead of outside payment processors, allowing the tech giants to collect a 30 percent cut. If tech companies fail to comply with the new law, they could face fines of up to 3 percent of their South Korea revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNYI55"&gt;The law is &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210824010651320"&gt;an amendment to South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act&lt;/a&gt;, and it could have a large impact on how Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store do business globally. South Korea’s National Assembly passed the bill on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GoDypm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Neither company is happy about it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BuinVx"&gt;Neither company is happy about it. In a statement, Google defended its service fees, which it says “helps keep Android free,” and gives developers “the tools and global platform to access billions of consumers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ4yQH"&gt;“Just as it costs developers money to build an app, it costs us money to build and maintain an operating system and app store,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakKxF"&gt;A representative from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;However, prior to the law’s passing, the company sent over the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WQK7nh"&gt;The proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like “Ask to Buy” and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal—leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WiFTPR"&gt;Lobbyists for the two companies have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/technology/apple-google-south-korea-app-store.html"&gt;reportedly argued to American officials&lt;/a&gt; that the Korean legislation violates a trade agreement, as it seeks to control the actions of US-based companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ie3QNX"&gt;South Korea isn’t the only country that’s trying to bend American tech giants to its will. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;Russia requires that gadgets come pre-installed&lt;/a&gt; with apps made by Russian developers, and  &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-considering-new-laws-apple-google-wechat-digital-wallets-2021-08-30/"&gt;Australia is looking into regulating services&lt;/a&gt; like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Some in the US government have even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;proposed legislation similar&lt;/a&gt; to what was passed by South Korea. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that South Korea’s new legislation could end up being referenced by regulators in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnA8Nj"&gt;Both Apple and Google have been trying to stave off such actions through changes to their store policies. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;introduced its App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt;, which halved Apple’s cut from developers earning less than a million dollars a year on its store. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;agreed to let developers&lt;/a&gt; inform their users about payment options outside the App Store, using the email addresses that users gave them. Google said that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;only take 15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of developers' first million dollars instead of 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfkiI9"&gt;Both Apple and Google have faced legal challenges despite the changes, with the most notable coming from Epic Games. Epic argued that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; used their dominant positions to dictate what could and could not be done with their phones. While Epic’s argument is different against each company, they share the same core complaint: Apple and Google’s dominance over the app stores. Both cases are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYAzT8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 31st, 7:21AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added new statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the robotaxi that will be available on the Lyft app in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c02rG1_goy7DmqJVCzFkGhOW9Kw=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796821/04._Priority_image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ciMMtc"&gt;Motional, the autonomous vehicle company that is a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, revealed more details about its forthcoming robotaxi as well as some of the first images of the vehicle. The company is also working with Lyft and says that by 2023, customers in certain cities will be able to hail rides in this vehicle using the Lyft app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OoRqw"&gt;Motional first announced earlier this year that it would be using the Hyundai Ioniq 5, an all-electric crossover, as its inaugural vehicle. The company hasn’t said how many vehicles it would acquire, nor where it will eventually deploy them for its robotaxi service. It’s currently operating a fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Las Vegas in collaboration with Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugFiUi"&gt;The Motional robotaxi will be fitted with “more than 30 sensors,” such as cameras, radar, and lidar, prominently displayed around the exterior to help identify it as a vehicle that drives itself. The sensors provide the vehicle with a 360-degree field of vision, including high-resolution images and the ability to detect objects from a long distance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NESGfq70gzFJseY1bb6BSFsjYOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22815645/01._Hero.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FI6g1U"&gt;The vehicle will come equipped with the hardware and software necessary for Level 4 autonomous driving, meaning the vehicle can operate without a human behind the steering wheel under certain conditions. Motional has previously tested its vehicles without safety drivers on public roads in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUrrC8"&gt;The Ioniq 5 is an interesting choice for Motional’s robotaxi. Hyundai claims it has nearly 300 miles of range on a single charge and a two-way charging feature that can supply up to 3.6kW of power. It will also be built on Hyundai’s new Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) that the automaker says will serve as the basis for an entire family of planned EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvfkTN"&gt;Motional says that E-GMP will provide “passengers with a spacious, comfortable place to work, relax, or socialize during their driverless ride.” The company also teased a passenger experience that will include “an interior suite of rider-focused interfaces” that enable customers to add an extra stop on their trip, even when there’s no one in the driver’s seat. Motional claims it will “set a new standard for driverless ride-hailing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmwN7u"&gt;Lyft was previously working on its own autonomous vehicle technology but recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404406/toyota-lyft-autonomous-vehicle-acquisition-amount-deal"&gt;sold off its entire division to a subsidiary of Toyota&lt;/a&gt; for $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOWC6c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch gets a walkie talkie feature of its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Most of the pre-installed apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 come from Samsung." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VjrjQTyLLXnfW1QTfc7wlPOK8f4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796813/dbohn_210816_4717_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Watch 4.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VkGD8j"&gt;Samsung has released a new walkie talkie app for the Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic, which allows watch owners to have push-to-talk conversations with one another using the wearable. The app’s release was &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-watch-4-walkie-talkie/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but its development was rumored in May &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-galaxy-watch-4-feature-wear-os-confirmed/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prior to the watch’s official announcement&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It’s available to download now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.wear.walkietalkie"&gt;via the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FK3hPF"&gt;The app’s release comes after Apple added a similar feature to its Apple Watch back in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17428180/walkie-talkie-apple-watch-facetime-audio-wwdc-2028"&gt;with WatchOS 5&lt;/a&gt;. But while Apple’s push-to-talk walkie talkie feature only lets two people communicate at once, Samsung’s supports “two or more users” by setting up a Walkie-Talkie channel to chat in. That is, so long as you can find enough people using the Wear OS 3-based Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic, the only two wearables currently listed as compatible with the app on its Play Store listing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VanMoof adds manual gear shifting to S3 and X3 e-bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdCZYUnkicYBTRtzyP2QRoYCjlI=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69796811/DSC_0700.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rz9I9h"&gt;VanMoof has released a firmware update for its S3 and X3 e-bikes that allows for manual gear shifting. If you’re thinking that sounds like a pretty basic feature for a bicycle, you’d be right. But Vanmoof’s latest bikes have fully automatic four-gear shifters, and until now, there was no way to change gears yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svstvZ"&gt;The automatic shifter is convenient and generally works well, but as with automatic gearboxes in cars, you do occasionally find yourself riding in a suboptimal gear. While this can normally be fixed by easing off the pedals or using the turbo boost button, it’s not always practical given factors such as terrain. VanMoof does offer settings for hilly and flat land, as well as the ability to customize at what speeds the gears shift up and down, but you’ll inevitably find yourself wanting a manual shifter every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlngAy"&gt;That’s what’s been delivered with the new firmware, and I’ve been using it for a few days on my personal X3. All things considered, it works better than I expected, especially since the bikes have such a spartan control setup. You first need to activate manual shifting in the mobile app, then you’ll be able to shift up by double-tapping the turbo boost button near the right grip and shift down by performing the same action while holding down the bell button near the left grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dw41U3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"VanMoof S3 e-bike review: better than the best","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"},{"title":"VanMoof X3: five months later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="WPPoVp"&gt;The bike plays a noise out of its speaker when you change gears, which isn’t exactly the kind of feedback you’d get from a regular bike, but it does the job. I haven’t once seen the bike fail to shift when I attempted to do so, nor have I accidentally blared out a bell noise. I got used to everything pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crzg4s"&gt;The problem, though — and I accept that this is 100 percent the result of having ridden an automatic-shifting bike almost daily for more than a year at this point, and it will sound ridiculous to any regular bike rider — is that I don’t always want to have to shift gears myself. I like the automatic shifter, and it’s really just an occasional annoyance that it’d be nice to be able to override a couple of times a week. The way the manual shifting works here is that it’s either on or off all the time, so it’s not going to help you in a pinch — it’s just another way to ride the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33AftF"&gt;That could still be useful for a lot of people, though. If you live in a hilly city or have an awkward commute that trips up the automatic shifter, it might be worth switching to this setting at certain times. Personally, I don’t really see myself using it unless it’s ever possible to shift manually while in an automatic mode. And for people who do want to shift manually most of the time, they’d probably be better served by bikes with more conventional controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c1TKrzP4L2BZAOJcHuVu2XgKFBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19913124/verge_DSC_7155_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The turbo boost button on the VanMoof S3.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NwWv4i"&gt;What I will use, however, is another new feature that comes with this firmware and lets you shift motor assist modes while in motion. Previously, you could only do this from within the app or by holding down the boost button while the bike was stationary; now, the latter method works as long as you’re not pedaling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evqwbg"&gt;I shift motor assist modes quite often depending on the setting and situation — I’ll turn it down when riding with my wife and her non-e-bike, for example, or when I want to save battery power. But I usually realize I want to change when I’m actually riding the bike, so this will come in useful. It’s definitely a feature that demands caution, since you have to look down at the screen on the frame to confirm which mode you’ve switched to (there are four degrees of power assist), so I wouldn’t recommend using it on busy streets or at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gq8Z9"&gt;Overall this is a solid feature drop for the VanMoof S3 and X3 that could make a big difference to the way people ride their bikes. The manual shifting might not get much use from me, but I’m glad to know it’s there, and it might just fix what would otherwise have been a dealbreaker for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rfgWFP"&gt;The Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 have inherited a battery protection that was previously exclusive to Samsung’s tablets, which when enabled is designed to maximize the lifespan of batteries, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-3-and-z-flip-3-have-tablet-like-battery-protection-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The “Protect battery” feature limits the devices’ charge level to 85 percent, preventing the full charge to 100 percent that’s believed to wear down batteries over years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFdn3B"&gt;The feature, which is available in the Settings app under Device Care &amp;gt; Battery &amp;gt; More battery settings, comes with the obvious trade-off of limiting the max battery life you’ll get out of either phone per charge. In our reviews we noted that both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; average around a day of battery life by default, which means you might have to commit to a midday top-up if you’re only charging to 85 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Protect battery feature in the Samsung Settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bMDNAs"&gt;That might be a price worth paying if you want to get as many years of use as possible out of the pricey flagship phones, especially considering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum#:~:text=Is%20all,custom%20glue."&gt;difficulty of repairing either device&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0S0Jug"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; notes that this isn’t the first time Samsung has included the Protect battery feature on its devices. But this is the first time it’s appeared on one of the company’s phones. The feature is available with One UI 3.1.1 on the two foldables, but reportedly hasn’t appeared on its other smartphones &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-s20-note-10-note-20-get-one-ui-3-1-1-updates/"&gt;with the same update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjCLaj"&gt;Other smartphone manufacturers already offer similar battery protection features. However, while Samsung’s feature won’t ever let a device’s battery charge beyond 85 percent, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210512"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054830/oneplus-optimized-charging-battery-overnight-overcharging-percentage"&gt;OnePlus’s&lt;/a&gt; equivalent features only temporarily limit their charging levels to 80 percent, before aiming to top up their batteries to 100 percent just before they’re unplugged to limit the time spent fully charged.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13’s rumored satellite link sounds like it’s just for emergencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTbREU_Xs0DW0aQhAlHaVr2kmEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69795964/vpavic_4243_20201017_0077.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqc8Bg"&gt;Apple plans to let you connect your iPhone to satellites so you can contact emergency services in areas that don’t have cellular coverage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/apple-plans-to-add-satellite-features-to-iphones-for-emergencies?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;according to a new &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;article was published after Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Sunday that the iPhone 13 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647252/the-iphone-13-5g-leo-satellite"&gt;may be able to make satellite calls&lt;/a&gt;. Kuo often reveals details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/17/18682820/apple-5g-iphone-2020-oled-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228861/apple-iphone-kuo-rumor-ipad-ipod-touch-airpower-airpods"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; before the company officially announces them, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; sources indicate that Apple’s approach for iPhone satellite connectivity may be more limited to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYJAg9"&gt;One feature, called Emergency Message via Satellite, will let you text emergency services and emergency contacts when you don’t have a cell signal by harnessing a satellite network, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. These messages will have a length limit and be represented as a grey bubble instead of the green used for SMS messages and the blue used for iMessages. And when you’re sending one of these messages to an emergency contact, it will reportedly push through even if they have Do Not Disturb mode turned on, which could help ensure that your message is seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4cpaQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New emergency reporting features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S15bkM"&gt;Another feature will let users report emergencies. “The phone will ask what kind of emergency is happening, such as whether it involves a car, boat, plane or fire,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. You’ll also be able to send information such as your location and your Medical ID (which you can set up in the Health app). You may also be able to notify emergency contacts at the same time you report an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1E08p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the next iPhone might have the required hardware to make satellite calls. But a source tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that the new features probably won’t be ready before next year, throwing cold water on the idea that you might be able to use them as soon as you buy the next iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ceva6Y"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OW6pDa"&gt;The new satellite link features, if they are released, could help ease fears about being able to contact emergency services in a time of need or when you’re away from a cellular network. There’s also the possibility the features could provide another way to get in touch with emergency services in the event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494652/911-outage-centurylink-lumen-intrado"&gt;of 911 outages&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17515464/att-911-emergency-outage-fine-fcc-2017"&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8990735/t-mobile-17-5-million-911-outages-fcc"&gt;happen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8244041/fcc-verizon-911-outage-fine"&gt;occasionally&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome 94 beta tests some next-gen tech for gaming in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkCsp9SdmuGGe4dumRYIF1Dn9Pc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69795918/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FpRqPy"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/08/chrome-94-beta-webcodecs-webgpu.html"&gt;Chrome Beta 94 announcement&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Google is implementing some new web standards that could make browser-based gaming experiences even better. The soon-to-be-released &lt;a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5669293909868544"&gt;WebCodecs&lt;/a&gt; could help make cloud gaming easier and faster, while the experimental &lt;a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6213121689518080"&gt;WebGPU&lt;/a&gt; could make it easier for developers of games that run in the browser to tap into your computer’s power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXFLFF"&gt;WebCodecs is &lt;a href="https://web.dev/webcodecs/"&gt;an API designed to give developers better access&lt;/a&gt; to the video encoding/decoding codecs that are already bundled with your browser, which figure out what to do with video streams. While there are already methods of getting video to play in Chrome, they’re not necessarily designed for things like cloud gaming, which is best when it’s as low-latency as possible. WebCodecs is built to avoid overhead, making it easier to get the incoming video stream onto your screen as fast as possible, potentially with the help of hardware decoding. This will also, in theory, make it perform better than it currently does on slower machines (which are the kinds of computers where cloud gaming is most desirable anyhow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvC725"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both technologies simplify and streamline things that technically could’ve been done before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zYWAuv"&gt;The newer, &lt;a href="https://web.dev/gpu/"&gt;more experimental WebGPU&lt;/a&gt; gives web developers better access to your computer’s graphics horsepower, by letting them hook into your computer’s native graphics API (similar to Apple’s Metal, Microsoft’s DirectX 12, or Vulkan). In simpler terms, it makes it easier for web developers to talk to your graphics card in a language it understands, without having to go through other layers that could slow things down. It’s &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7380/next-generation-3d-graphics-on-the-web/"&gt;meant to be a next-generation version of WebGL&lt;/a&gt;, which lets developers tap into the (now reasonably out of date) OpenGL framework. In the future, the tech should make it easier for developers to make graphically intense games that run in the browser, tapping into the full power of current-generation GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1UEOg"&gt;Both technologies have their place outside of gaming too. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nhTxJBgTywc?t=505"&gt;In a July 2020 talk&lt;/a&gt;, Google mentioned that Zoom was interested in using WebCodecs for videoconferencing, and &lt;a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/explainer/#use-cases"&gt;WebGPU could be used&lt;/a&gt; to render 3D models in the browser or to accelerate machine learning models. It makes sense that they’d show up in Chrome, as these are all areas Google plays in, from cloud gaming with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18654632/google-stadia-price-release-date-games-bethesda-ea-doom-ubisoft-e3-2019"&gt;Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638696/google-meet-echo-warning-text-alert"&gt;own video conferencing apps&lt;/a&gt;. Both pieces of tech are open standards though, developed by the W3C, and other browser makers have &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/webgpu"&gt;begun testing them as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7NZRXF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers will still have to make their apps work with WebCodecs, and look into WebGPU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ym3j"&gt;Of course, we probably won’t be seeing experiences powered by WebCodecs or WebGPU for a little while. While WebCodecs is actually getting close to release (it’s expected to be turned on by default in the upcoming Chrome 94), developers will still have to make their apps work with it. As for WebGPU, it’s currently in its experimental trial phase, which &lt;a href="https://web.dev/gpu/"&gt;Google expects to end&lt;/a&gt; in early 2022. Whether it’ll end up as a feature at that point depends on how the trial goes, if the specification is done, and if enough people are interested in using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lrh0Uv"&gt;While these technologies may not make things that were impossible possible, they’re exciting nonetheless. When things are easier, or more flexible, it lowers the barrier of entry for developers. For gamers looking to play on the web, either through streaming or native games, the time developers save on figuring out how to get frames onto your screen is time they can spend making other parts of the experience better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max and YouTube are now on Spectrum TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9yYe3IWlOEY5tkKqF3AjjiOjOQI=/295x0:1210x610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794872/HBO_Max_in_Apps_Menu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Spectrum TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T6a5MI"&gt;Two of the biggest players in streaming, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube, have officially arrived on Spectrum TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykoa4Y"&gt;It’s the first time the apps have been supported on Spectrum TV, Charter’s digital cable provider and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629518/spectrum-tv-app-roku-channel-store"&gt;live TV app&lt;/a&gt;, and users will be able to access content from both apps through the platform’s guide on channels 2004 for HBO Max and 2003 for YouTube. Users will also be able to find them by searching the guide or from the guide’s apps menu. (A subscription to HBO Max, which costs $10 per month with ads or $15 to go ad-free and unlock same-day theatrical releases, will still be required to access the content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjnVvu"&gt;The two apps are huge additions to Spectrum’s platform. &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeHBOMaxYoutube083021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which launched well over a year ago, offers more than 13,000 hours of premium content from brands that include HBO, DC, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Studio Ghibli, and Max Originals, among others. The service also made Warner Bros.’ entire 2021 film slate available on its premium tier the same day those films debut in theaters at no additional cost. While a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;controversial move&lt;/a&gt; and one that’s caused WarnerMedia quite a few headaches, it’s a tremendous value for anyone uncertain about returning to theaters just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhFspw"&gt;A spokesperson noted that the guide channels offer an additional method for customers to access the HBO Max and YouTube apps. Together with Netflix, they’re the first three streaming apps to be accessible directly through the Spectrum Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMRGJ"&gt;“As the video landscape continues to change, we are evolving our products and making it easier for our customers to watch what they want by providing access to streaming apps from convenient launch points within the Spectrum TV experience,” Elena Ritchie, Spectrum’s group vice president of video experience, said in a statement. “We look forward to growing this library and expect to launch more streaming video apps in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM temporarily stops making the Chevy Bolt after latest recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1rxJ2BMzB34OOJ_fVTF7eMFyQc=/0x0:5700x3800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69794866/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Chevrolet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yIlq0v"&gt;General Motors is halting production of the Chevy Bolt EV after a number of battery fires prompted a massive recall that has already cost the company nearly $2 billion. The automaker won’t resume making the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;2022 Bolt and Bolt EUV&lt;/a&gt; until at least mid-September. It had initially stopped production last week because of the global chip shortage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLwSka"&gt;The recall repair process is also on hold, as GM is still waiting to get new battery modules from its supplier, South Korean conglomerate LG, that it is confident are free of defects. “We will not resume repairs or restart production until we are confident LG is producing defect free products for us,” GM spokesman Daniel Flores said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwK9TP"&gt;It’s the latest blow to one of the most capable and competitively priced electric vehicles on the market, and it comes as GM is getting ready to dramatically increase the number of EVs in its lineup. Those new EVs will also be powered by batteries from LG, which makes the cells that GM identified as the cause of the fires in the Bolt. GM CEO Mary Barra told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; late last week, though, that the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/gm-ceo-touts-multiple-battery-options-while-affirming-lg-deal?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;recall will not affect companies’ plan to keep collaborating on EV batteries&lt;/a&gt; — despite GM saying it plans to make LG pay for the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuiMLJ"&gt;GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;first recalled 2017–2019 Chevy Bolts&lt;/a&gt; in November 2020 after a handful of fires had been reported. But it wasn’t until May 2021 that the company explained it would attempt to prevent future fires by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;installing new software on those older Bolts&lt;/a&gt; as well as on all new models being made. That fix didn’t work, though, as at least two more Bolts caught fire by July that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577757/gm-chevy-bolt-fires-recall-fix-software-update-not-working"&gt;had the new software&lt;/a&gt;. GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590210/chevy-bolt-new-recall-battery-defect-fire-risk-fix"&gt;issued a second recall&lt;/a&gt; and also finally started to share that it believed certain defects in the cells were causing the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5pCYi"&gt;Then, on August 20th, just days after a 2020 Bolt caught fire, GM issued a third recall for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634721/gm-recall-chevrolet-bolt-battery-fire-fix-problems"&gt;all Bolt EVs ever made&lt;/a&gt; — some 140,000 — including the two new 2022 versions that launched this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzGFIr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Srslhl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izV0Jv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
