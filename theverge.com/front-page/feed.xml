    <title>Vergecast: 10 years of Tim Cook, iPhone 13 rumors, and the OnlyFans decision</title>

  &lt;p id="KG5sA9"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lk0IkF"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2462775031&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GnLRj"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay, Dieter, and managing editor Alex Cranz talk with senior reporter Adi Robertson about why OnlyFans planned to prohibit sexually explicit content on its platform and then quickly reversed its decision days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OauTMW"&gt;In the second half of the show, the crew pivots to discuss Tim Cook’s first 10 years as Apple CEO and the rumors about some Apple products coming this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z29cLN"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in this episode — like a new gadget to remix Kanye West songs and Elon Musk’s humanoid Tesla robots — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors taps Hertz board member to right the ship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Endurance All-Electric Pickup Truck Reveal Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBz6eqzykCAKFPZwH42RUDuoxyM=/0x109:5623x3858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784569/1222922472.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EY6Uby"&gt;Lordstown Motors has hired a new CEO, Daniel Ninivaggi, just two months after its previous chief executive and founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;resigned after misleading investors&lt;/a&gt;. Ninivaggi comes from an automotive background and recently wrapped up a seven-year stint as a member of Hertz’s board of directors, where he helped oversee the rental car company’s very public bankruptcy and restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz5C6u"&gt;That experience could come in handy. Lordstown Motors needs someone at the helm who can steer the company through the adversity that lies ahead — including, mainly, surviving past early 2022, which is when the startup says it expects to deliver its first electric pickup trucks &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;when it will also run out of money unless it finds new funding. But Lordstown Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;struggles since its late 2020 SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; have also played out under an intense spotlight, something that Ninivaggi appears to have gained some experience with at Hertz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3dBXE"&gt;Hertz was in crisis mode during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in large part &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-26/goldman-was-just-trying-to-help?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;because it had borrowed heavily against its fleet of cars&lt;/a&gt;. As the markets dipped, the company’s lenders got jittery and started thinking about seizing those cars in order to recoup what they were owed. In response, Hertz filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sh3elE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NWnhv6"&gt;That’s when the real weirdness started. Hertz became a darling of the booming population of retail traders, including those who had been introduced to the stock market by apps like Robinhood as well as those who spend their time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;obsessing over information shared in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. People were buying Hertz stock left and right, post-bankruptcy, despite there being &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/883047437/owner-of-a-broken-hertz"&gt;almost no chance that the shares they were trading would be worth anything&lt;/a&gt; when the company was eventually restructured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fL8yba"&gt;In other words, Hertz was a meme stock before that term became part of our shared lexicon. And the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-12/if-you-want-hertz-have-some-hertz?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;tried to take advantage of this&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to sell even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;shares directly to those eager retail traders, though a judge quickly cut them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57KcxM"&gt;As all this was happening, Hertz’s largest shareholder cut bait and backed out: billionaire Carl Icahn sold his company’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hertz-glo-hldg-bankruptcy-icahn/billionaire-icahn-exits-hertz-with-significant-loss-after-bankruptcy-filing-idUSKBN23339J"&gt;stake in Hertz in mid-2020&lt;/a&gt;. But Ninivaggi — one of Icahn’s former executives — remained on Hertz’s board. The company eventually emerged from bankruptcy this year and, to the surprise of many, regular &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-05-12/money-stuff-the-hertz-gamblers-were-right?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;retail shareholders actually got something in return after all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZLy14"&gt;Ninivaggi has other automotive experience beyond Hertz, mostly at companies that are deep in the supply chain. Whether or not Lordstown Motors was more attracted to that, or to Ninivaggi’s experience with Hertz’s rollercoaster year, the cash-strapped startup is paying handsomely to have him run the show. He’ll make an annual salary of $750,000 and is eligible for a yearly bonus of nearly $1 million, according to a filing with the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921109520/tm2125956d3_8k.htm"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC), and was given a company stock package currently worth around $4.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn8Tt2"&gt;In return, he’ll have to help the startup get its electric pickup truck into production, raise more money (including following up on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;plan to rent out space at its factory&lt;/a&gt;), and then compete in an increasingly crowded field of electric pickup trucks. All this while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;facing down investigations from the Department of Justice and SEC&lt;/a&gt; that were kicked off by his predecessor’s misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft won’t stop you installing Windows 11 on older PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bV8dQOMT2f2VzKcCny934l5HVLQ=/0x0:1650x1100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784505/windows11main.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0xgxM4"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that it won’t block people from installing Windows 11 on most older PCs. While the software maker has recommended hardware requirements for Windows 11 — which it’s largely sticking to — a restriction to install the OS will only be enforced when you try to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 through Windows Update. This means anyone with a PC with an older CPU that doesn’t officially pass the upgrade test can still go ahead and download an ISO file of Windows 11 and install the OS manually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLvzcH"&gt;Microsoft announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware"&gt;Windows 11 minimum hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; in June, and made it clear that only Intel 8th Gen and beyond CPUs were officially supported. Microsoft now tells us that this install workaround is designed primarily for businesses to evaluate Windows 11, and that people can upgrade at their own risk as the company can’t guarantee driver compatibility and overall system reliability. Microsoft won’t be recommending or advertising this method of installing Windows 11 to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfKHEK"&gt;It’s a big change that means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;millions of PCs&lt;/a&gt; won’t be left behind, technically. Consumers will still need to go to the effort of downloading an ISO file and manually installing Windows 11, which the vast majority probably won’t do. But for those happy to install Windows manually, the actual minimum Windows 11 specs mean that CPU generations don’t matter, as long as you have a 64-bit 1GHz processor with two or more cores, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI6k5xCoGk3Cjzg7J2LDyTDIdXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671569/windows11main.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 will now run on older CPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GqoXja"&gt;Alongside the workaround to install Windows 11, Microsoft is also tweaking its minimum system requirements to include more processors. Intel’s Core X-series and Xeon W-series will now be officially supported for Windows 11 upgrades, alongside Intel’s Core 7820HQ chip that’s inside the Surface Studio 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCPFCw"&gt;Microsoft has been testing these processors with Intel, but the 7820HQ is only supported on devices that ship with &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/dch-principles-best-practices#dch-design-principles"&gt;Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps (DCH)&lt;/a&gt;. You may have heard of DCH in GPU drivers, and it’s a cleaner and more secure driver design that Microsoft has been encouraging OEMs and hardware manufacturers to adopt in recent years. Apps like GPU control panels are separated from the driver install with DCH, allowing OEMs to service them separately without having to issue new driver updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgFQ3z"&gt;Microsoft won’t be officially supporting any Zen 1 CPUs, despite testing them recently. “After carefully analyzing the first generation of AMD Zen processors in partnership with AMD, together we concluded that there are no additions to the supported CPU list,” says Microsoft’s Windows team in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZJ0VO"&gt;Obviously there is a workaround to install Windows 11 on these older AMD systems, but Microsoft says devices that don’t meet the minimum hardware requirements “had 52 percent more kernel mode crashes.” Devices that meet the official minimum specs “had a 99.8 percent crash free experience,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated PC Health Check app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ux2KXb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to update its PC Health Check app (&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindowsinsiderpreviewpchealth" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a preview is available here&lt;/a&gt;) to include the new Intel CPUs and provide much greater clarity on why your PC might not be able to officially upgrade. The new PC checker app will let Windows users know if they need to simply enable Secure Boot or TPM 2.0 to upgrade, which is much better than the vague unsupported message that greeted many in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8rwBY"&gt;Microsoft also details how it arrived at these minimum system requirements for Windows 11. Microsoft wants to push Windows toward modern DCH drivers and modern security with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support and virtualization-based security (VBS). There’s never a good time to try to change hardware requirements, but with a workaround in place it does cushion the blow of what Microsoft is trying to achieve around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;improving the security, compatibility, and reliability aspects of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a tiny tube amp in this super pricey Astell &amp; Kern music player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cccVmGKqjPuRUCIjbQJXc-skt0o=/0x0:2234x1489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784480/akultimahero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qj4Sdc"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s latest portable music player is as high-tech as it is extravagantly expensive. &lt;a href="http://aknewsroom.armourhome.co.uk/2021/08/27/astellkerns-latest-aultima-sp2000t-portable-digital-audio-player-packs-a-next-gen-triple-amp-system/"&gt;The $2,399 A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T&lt;/a&gt; releases in October, and it stands out from the brand’s previous models like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15752152/astell-kern-kann-review-audiophile-pmp"&gt;Kann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18518150/astell-kern-kann-cube-audiophile-pmp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Kann Cube&lt;/a&gt; with a new triple amp system. These things are never affordable, and the price might seem especially out there if you’re content with listening to music from a streaming service on your phone. But there’s some real engineering swagger in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoQaKO"&gt;Astell &amp;amp; Kern managed to fit a tiny tube amp inside of this device. Specifically, it uses &lt;a href="https://korgnutube.com/en/"&gt;a Korg Nutube 6P1&lt;/a&gt;, which conceptually operates just like larger tube amps, only it’s small enough to fit in a device that can go in your pocket. To avoid any interference that the resonance of the tubes might generate, Astell &amp;amp; Kern says it developed a modular structure on the PCB just for the tubes, fixing them with silicone to minimize vibrations. The best part of the press release is that it says its design “uses magnetic forces to float the amp in the air to reduce internal noise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFeiKo"&gt;Audiophiles reading this have every right to be skeptical that Astell &amp;amp; Kern can reproduce the effect of a tube amp with such minuscule hardware, but it at least deserves some credit for trying. Check it out in action below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lqdmIZNEYjqezZgxbkSgzwPqMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809604/astellandkern7.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fe5okP"&gt;When you’re using the A&amp;amp;ultima SP2000T, it’ll let you switch between its OP-AMP setting for “ultra-clarity and a dynamic playback,” the tube amp mode for a “uniquely warm” sound, and a hybrid mode that blends the best of both modes into one. Additionally, this model has an ESS ES9068AS quad DAC for further enhancing the way your music sounds. This is apparently Astell &amp;amp; Kern’s first player to feature a quad DAC, as well as the Replay Gain utility, which adjusts the volume of all of your music (up to 24-bit / 192kHz) to the same level, so one song isn’t quieter than the other. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Astell &amp;amp;amp; Kern A&amp;amp;amp;Ultima SP2000T" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUwgXcceOaZDdFuE7MPxTLt_rMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22809612/akultima.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astell &amp;amp; Kern&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFN7nK"&gt;Now, for some specs. The player is compatible with 2.5mm, 3.5mm, and 44.mm plugs. It has a five-inch 1080p touchscreen, which might be the least impressive thing about it. You can charge it and transfer files via its USB-C port. It’s also Wi-Fi ready, supporting the company’s AK File Drop utility that lets you transfer files wirelessly via PC, phone, or even an FTP on the same network. You’ll obviously get the best sound quality with a set of high-end, wired headphones or earphones, but it also supports Bluetooth 5.0 with 24-bit aptX HD and LDAC codec support. Lastly, it has 256GB of flash storage built in, but it supports up to 1TB via microSD. It has a 4,200mAh battery, which the company says will get you about nine hours of FLAC playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfGcDP"&gt;For people with the sort of budget that allows this kind of purchase, this seems like something you may want to try before you buy. It’s possible that Astell &amp;amp; Kern created something great that defies its pocket-sized stature, but it’s just as likely that this has some overly ambitious first-gen quirks to iron out. You’ll be able to find out yourself when it releases in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton drops the price of its original Bike by $400 amid poor earnings results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMjYxVYlXID8XCZM7n_57aZ2zwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784251/akrales_170407_1569_0850.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7se5A1"&gt;Peloton has &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/making-it-easier-to-become-part-of-the-peloton-community"&gt;dropped the price of its original Bike&lt;/a&gt; by $400, making it $1,495. This price reduction comes alongside the company’s 2021 financial earnings, which showed that the company grew less than expected, and lost more than it had predicted (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/peloton-pton-q4-2021-loss.html"&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4836b73e-6e63-4517-a3cd-86c45ea98e68"&gt;The company reports&lt;/a&gt; that in the fourth quarter of its 2021 financial year, it had a net loss of just over $313 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bFYqN"&gt;While the company’s financial results certainly give it a reason to want to boost growth, this isn’t the original Peloton Bike’s first price drop. Its previous price point of $1,895 was the result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427003/peloton-new-treadmill-bike-plus-exercise-equipment-features-price"&gt;a price drop that happened&lt;/a&gt; alongside the introduction of the Bike Plus last September, which took it down from its original &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/peloton-slashes-the-price-of-its-bike-by-hundreds-of-dollars-to-1495.html"&gt;$2,245 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mTVmBL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peloton says it wants to lower the barrier of entry to its workout equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6RsYXp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/making-it-easier-to-become-part-of-the-peloton-community"&gt;Peloton’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; about Wednesday’s price drop spins it a different way, saying that the price drop is a way to allow more people into the Peloton community, lowering the barrier of entry. Of course, the Bike is at its best when paired with a $40-a-month Peloton Membership — the more bikes Peloton sells, the more memberships it’s likely to get. Given that subscription profit is one of the places the company is being successful (Peloton reports 158.9 percent year-over-year growth in subscription gross profit for Q4), it’s likely the company wants to keep riding that high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVsriN"&gt;This news also comes as Peloton is getting ready to relaunch its lower-cost treadmill (appropriately named the Tread) at the end of August. When &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/new-peloton-bike-tread/"&gt;it was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, the $2,495 Tread was supposed to slot in under the more expensive Tread Plus, though Peloton currently isn’t selling that model due to a recall that stemmed from a series of injuries and one death. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;Tread Plus recall&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the separate recall that delayed the Tread’s launch, are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/peloton-pton-q4-2021-loss.html"&gt;cited by CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and Peloton as part of the reason for the company’s financial woes last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS39Jb"&gt;Peloton may also have new products on the horizon to go along with its bikes and treadmills — it appears the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634770/peloton-rower-rumors-android-app-mazu-app-analysis"&gt;finally working on its long-rumored rowing machine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545560/peloton-wearble-heart-rate-monitor-fitness"&gt;there are rumors&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on a heart rate monitoring armband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAjQ1D"&gt;If the Bike’s price drop has intrigued you, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15408338/bike-peloton-review-indoor-cycle-live-streaming-cycling"&gt;read our review of it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian files to go public at up to a reported $80 billion valuation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oSci-s4zz4znkxLnlY0qDxVZN0k=/621x504:2221x1571/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784225/rivian_r1t_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FfHS8z"&gt;Buzzy (and extremely well-funded) EV startup Rivian has filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public. Rivian will be doing a traditional initial public offering, bucking the recent trend of electric vehicles going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U977yH"&gt;The company, which is backed by Amazon and Ford, announced that it submitted a draft registration statement for the IPO &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210827005292/en/Rivian-Announces-Confidential-Submission-of-Draft-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Public-Listing#.YSj7kO5r9HM.twitter"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The draft will initially remain confidential, though &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/rivian-is-said-to-file-for-ipo-seek-about-80-billion-valuation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has reported that Rivian is seeking a valuation as high as $80 billion. The IPO date is expected to be sometime before the end of this year. When it happens, Rivian will add to a fundraising war chest that is already over $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St6d4W"&gt;Rivian’s IPO filing comes as the startup is set to finally deliver its first vehicle: the R1T electric pickup truck. Originally revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, the R1T has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580293/rivian-delay-september-deliveries-electric-pickup-r1t-amazon"&gt;hit with multiple delays&lt;/a&gt;. Rivian’s second vehicle, an electric SUV known as the R1S, is supposed to follow soon after. Rivian is also developing electric delivery vans for Amazon, which owns at least 10 percent of the company following its investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZJ1Fb"&gt;Rivian bucking the SPAC trend fits the company’s longstanding pattern of zigging where other EV startups have zagged. While many of its peers (like Faraday Future, Byton, and Nio) emerged in the mid 2010s with splashy announcements and exorbitant spending, Rivian was founded in 2009 and stayed in stealth mode until 2018. Instead of trying to build its own factory, it bought an existing one and repurposed it (though it is now reportedly interested in building a second factory from scratch). Rivian spent a lot of time crafting a brand, too, instead of focusing solely on the technology it has been developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32DCy0"&gt;All told, it was an unusually methodical approach for an EV startup, but one that helped Rivian court big name investors and strategic partners along the way, setting it up for a big IPO that is now closer than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fA4ocC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota pauses self-driving ‘e-Palette’ service after one crashed into an Olympic athlete</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpWlTgUDLV1qzKt0WAfbUt1lFoE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784064/20201222_01_28.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AngzZd"&gt;Toyota has halted its autonomous shuttle service in Tokyo’s Olympic village after one of its vehicles collided with a visually impaired athlete, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-halts-all-self-driving-e-pallete-vehicles-after-olympic-village-accident-2021-08-27/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Technically, the vehicle was not driving autonomously but was under manual control at the time of the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHZWyH"&gt;Toyota had been operating dozens of its “e-Palette” shuttles during the Olympics as a demonstration of a far-out concept &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16863092/toyota-e-palette-self-driving-car-ev-ces-2018"&gt;the company first showed off in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Back then, the automaker said its e-Palettes, which are modular battery-electric vehicles without traditional controls like steering wheels or pedals, could operate either as ride-hailing shuttles or mobile retail spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRvMfN"&gt;Toyota saw the Olympics as an opportunity to demonstrate its new technology. The boxy vehicles were being used by athletes and Olympics staff for months prior to the start of the summer games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="la23Rp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota saw the Olympics as an opportunity to demonstrate its new technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJO6Gw"&gt;But that came to an end this week, after one of the vehicles slammed into an athlete that was set to compete in the Paralympic Games. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, the shuttle was at a T-intersection when it turned into the athlete at a speed of 1-2 kilometers-per-hour. The vehicle was under manual control at the time, with a human operator using the joystick control. The athlete was taken to a nearby medical center for treatment and was able to walk back to their residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yOyzR"&gt;Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda acknowledged the crash in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXhG_hFNK4"&gt;a video posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. “It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” he said, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gVQFv"&gt;A spokesperson confirmed that the e-Palette service has been halted as a result of the crash and could not say when it would be resumed. But this doesn’t spell the ultimate end of the e-Palette program, the spokesperson said. “This doesn’t mean the entire e-Palette program beyond its current use at the Games has been halted,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFDim3"&gt;Toyota’s shuttles look similar to the low-speed autonomous pods that are in operation in cities around the world. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690793/self-driving-shuttle-crash-las-vegas-manual-controls-locked-away"&gt;a driverless shuttle crashed into a truck in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; while in autonomous mode. Investigators later determined that the crash occurred partly because the safety operator inside the shuttle didn’t have direct access to the manual override controls. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga review: a promising start</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A laptop that knows its business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="F8aoQS"&gt;Most people know a ThinkPad when they see it. While the line has evolved throughout its decades of existence, it’s maintained a consistent ThinkPad look, ThinkPad feel, and ThinkPad set of features, from the red keyboard nub to the trio of discrete clickers. The formula has a devoted following, and with good reason — it’s tried and true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktU91K"&gt;With the new Titanium line, Lenovo seems to be trying some new things on for size. For one, the first X1 Titanium Yoga is the thinnest ThinkPad ever made (not to be confused with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;lightest&lt;/em&gt; ThinkPad ever made). There’s a hodgepodge of other stuff, too, including a 3:2 display (an aspect ratio you don’t see every day in the X1 series), a haptic touchpad, and a top cover that’s — as the name implies — actually made of titanium. There’s an IR webcam with human presence detection, a match-on-chip fingerprint reader, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. It’s a grab bag of eccentric features thrown together into one new, very unique ThinkPad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iPRUV"&gt;The result: fantastic. Sure, it’s a first-generation product, with some kinks to work out here and there. But with Intel’s 11th Gen processors and Evo certification in tow, the X1 Titanium Yoga is a solid contender in the premium business laptop sphere. It maintains the hallmarks of the ThinkPad line, but it’s unlike any ThinkPad we’ve ever seen before. I’m excited about this one, but I’m more excited for the next generation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JdxzJj"&gt;Before we jump in, the usual disclaimer about ThinkPads: They’re expensive. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fx1-titanium-g1%2F22tp2x1x1t1%23models&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642876%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base X1 Titanium Yoga&lt;/a&gt; has an MSRP of $2,949, but is currently listed for $1,769.40. My test model has an MSRP of $3,369 but is listed for $1,674.39. (In case this wasn’t obvious, you should never pay full price for a ThinkPad.) This isn’t ridiculous as business laptops go, of course — a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fx1-carbon-gen9%2F22tp2x1x1c9%3Fclickid%3DxW2XgoUiVxyLUhwwUx0Mo3ZwUkBWZyQeNViK1M0%26irgwc%3D1%26PID%3D221109%26acid%3Dww%253Aaffiliate%253Abv0as6%26visibleDatas%3D696%253AIntel%25C2%25AE%2520Core%25E2%2584%25A2%2520i5%253B704%253A16%2520GB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22642876%2Flenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9&lt;/a&gt; with comparable specs is currently listed at $1,727.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxW71Z"&gt;Many ThinkPads have dizzying arrays of options to choose from, but the X1 Titanium Yoga’s selection is refreshingly straightforward. There are four processors, all of which support Intel’s vPro platform for remote management: the Core i5-1130G7 (which my test unit has), the Core i5-1140G7, and two Core i7 chips. The 1130G7 is the only processor available with 8GB of RAM; the other three come with 16GB. Human presence detection is also only available with the Core i5 models — you can’t get it with either Core i7, which is a bit frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEir6o"&gt;My model has the Core i5-1130G7, 16GB of RAM (soldered), 512GB of storage, and the presence-detection webcam. Like all models, it also has a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504, 450-nit touch display, and ships with Lenovo’s Precision Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j2wR60"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The X1 Titanium Yoga’s selection is refreshingly straightforward&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5KvLp"&gt;The Titanium Yoga’s primary selling point is its category-topping portability. It’s 0.45 inches thick, making it no problem to slide into a packed backpack or briefcase. The 3:2 aspect ratio makes it a bit taller than most competitors of this size, so it’s not one of the lightest laptops on the market — but at 2.54 pounds, it’s still a pretty effortless lift. I could be convinced that I’m carrying an empty chassis, rather than a full system, when I walk around with this device. It’s hard to believe there’s a whole... computer inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t5Ogq"&gt;Despite its thin frame, the Titanium Yoga is quite sturdy. Its lid is a combination of titanium and carbon fiber, while the rest is a more boring (and cheaper-feeling but still fine) magnesium aluminum. Lenovo claims to have tested the system against “12 military-grade certification methods and over 20 procedures.” I didn’t see any scratches or dinks in the chassis after my testing period, and the keyboard deck didn’t pick up a ton of fingerprints, though the lid did get a bit smudged. My only real complaint about the build quality is that I wish the hinge were sturdier. There was a decent amount of screen wobble when I used the stylus — so much that I mostly stuck with the touchpad in clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga from the left side with the stylus on top of the keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HzJ0t26AhNMterxFRl6CuSE9Bw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763955/akrales_210804_4676_0119.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power button, audio jack, lock slot on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga seen from the left side half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/70zYadCdVMyqfXzvcLqMjIBibmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763953/akrales_210804_4676_0098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Thunderbolt ports on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nV9Jgy"&gt;Laptops that are so extremely compact often come with significant tradeoffs for their size. There are a few worth noting here, though I wouldn’t call any of them disqualifying. The biggest drawback is certainly the haptic touchpad — as a space-saving measure it has no moving parts, so the clicking sensation is entirely simulated. While it convincingly emulates a regular touchpad, it has some other issues. It’s cramped for scrolling, its texture is a bit coarse for my liking, the click is stiff, and it’s not the most accurate — I sometimes felt like I had to coax the cursor to where it needed to go, and it occasionally thought I was scrolling or zooming in when I wasn’t trying to. This is one of those things I assume will improve over generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYGhMz"&gt;If you’re fed up with the touchpad, you do have the option of using the red keyboard nub or Lenovo’s Precision Pen, though there’s no garage to put the latter in (another space-saving measure). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nXThgD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I sometimes found myself having to lean in to hear the person speaking&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8g1Q0f"&gt;Another expected sacrifice is port selection. You get just two Thunderbolt 4 ports, both on the left side, one of which will be taken up by the charger. Get your dongles and docks ready. (There’s one audio jack and one Kensington lock slot as well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNviBP"&gt;Finally, audio is also often a thin affair on thin-and-light laptops, and the Titanium Yoga’s two upward-firing speakers are no exception. They deliver audio that’s clear but not particularly deep. Bass is not present. During Zoom calls, I sometimes found myself having to lean in to hear the person speaking, even with the volume cranked all the way up. The microphones did do a fine job of picking up my voice despite some background noise, and the F4 key functions as a kill switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left palm rest of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga with the stylus laid diagonally across it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBgzkvGKOX2G6qegTHnIbDfwwzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763948/akrales_210804_4676_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pen has 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, according to Lenovo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VCSAUVTsgG3aXbxlgMlyN1wBsoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763951/akrales_210804_4676_0069.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint sensor didn’t give me any trouble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGEMh8"&gt;But there’s no compromise in arguably the most important part of the laptop: performance. The Core i5 isn’t a workstation chip, but it handled my hefty load of Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, and Zoom calls with no problem. I never heard fan noise or felt uncomfortable heat, though the bottom of the chassis was consistently warm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJUCSQ"&gt;Battery life was okay, but not spectacular. The Yoga averaged seven hours and 52 minutes of continuous productivity work around medium brightness. While that doesn’t top the business category, it’s about what we expect from ThinkPads (we got a slightly worse result from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;the last X1 Carbon we reviewed&lt;/a&gt;). It means the device will just about get you through a work day if your load is similar to mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo logo on the lid of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KEFvNVJvcvx_PKXkXBj9ebblNZU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22763954/akrales_210804_4676_0109.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it in clamshell, tablet, or tent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MTQ0oS"&gt;All in all, the ThinkPad X1 Titanium Yoga is an interesting bet. It’s clear that Lenovo has an eye on the traits that modern business users have been asking for: stylus support, the 3:2 aspect ratio, durability, and portability, in addition to the security of the vPro platform. The Titanium Yoga is the first iteration of a line that I’m very excited to see Lenovo making, and for that I think it deserves a high score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNXvqG"&gt;With that said, I won’t pretend it’s the most practical purchase out there. It’s a first-generation product, and — as is often the case with first-generation products — there are some kinks to be worked out. The limited ports, the finicky touchpad, the shaky hinge, and the thin audio could all be overlooked on their own, especially as understandable sacrifices for the portable build — but they’re a lot to stomach as a package. I think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623290/thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Yoga&lt;/a&gt; and X1 Carbon, while a bit thicker, will be more pragmatic devices for the vast majority of users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uiIkLk"&gt;But the Titanium Yoga is still quite an achievement, and I can’t wait for the next one. If Lenovo works out the kinks, it’ll be a spectacular product.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pIxkE1"&gt;

    <title>Google’s new ad goes full Jony Ive on the Pixel 5A headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cW5fEv63jpAB8qrfJLMOucMd2p8=/0x96:2291x1623/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783690/FCEF04DB_AFC3_4613_8709_AC8887D9CD03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tgJYL7"&gt;Yesterday marked the release of Google’s $449 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A with 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has just released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oJZuSVl5wjM"&gt;a two-minute video&lt;/a&gt; that celebrates one of the phone’s very best hardware features. No, it’s not the new IP67 dust and water resistance. It’s not the larger screen or the biggest battery in a Pixel yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htW8zR"&gt;It’s all about the headphone jack, or “the circle” as this very Jony Ive-esque spot constantly refers to it. Google is truly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/3/19/22340529/google-pixel-switch-commercial-edible-meditation-god"&gt;getting out there with its YouTube advertising&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ve probably never seen a video about a headphone jack quite like this. I mean, the ad uses footage of a space station docking to underline the “satisfying feeling of click” you get when plugging headphones into Google’s latest phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uauOJH"&gt;My favorite part is when it dives right into the nitty-gritty of headphone jack terminology: Google says the Pixel 5A is “designed to welcome both 1/8th-inch three-pole TRS and four-pole TRRS connections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9xH7t"&gt;Even the video’s description is on point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rPh1sp"&gt;Calling this perfectly-symmetrical, technological marvel, a “headphone jack” may feel like an understatement...but technically, that’s what it’s called, so... fair enough. Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KKp4kn"&gt;The narrator declares the Pixel 5A’s headphone jack to be “a glorious achievement that draws from our past as it propels us into the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBEFVC"&gt;But something about that line got to me. Because now, my friends, we must come tumbling back to reality, where that “future” only applies to the midrange Pixel. Google’s next flagship smartphones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, won’t have the circle. However perfect it might be, it’s been absent on the top-tier Pixels since the Pixel 2.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer gaming mice, headsets, and more are discounted at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PrCHFKFRWfxSckAFhdrnMtKAR8Q=/0x0:1120x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69783673/akrales_191104_3773_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Razer Basilisk Ultimate is just one of many big sales in today’s roundup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ETWiCW"&gt;A wide variety of Razer gaming accessories are a featured &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/0211f3c4"&gt;deal of the day today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s advertised to get you “up to 30 percent off,” but there are deeply discounted products with items marked down as much as 40, 50, and 60 percent. Some notable ones to check out are the Razer Basilisk Ultimate wireless mouse for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Ultimate-HyperSpeed-Wireless/dp/B08564NLZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$94.99&lt;/a&gt;, the BlackShark V2 wired headset for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-Gaming-Headset-Detachable/dp/B086PKMZ1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the Huntsman TE TKL keyboard for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Tournament-Tenkeyless-Keyboard/dp/B07V25YPVW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IUShup"&gt;Amazon-owned Eero launched its Eero 6 line of Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers late last year, and today it's on sale for a new low price that even beats the recent Prime Day discount. You can pick up the Eero 6 router and two extenders &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Amazon for $195&lt;/a&gt;, a 30 percent discount. If you’re not familiar with mesh networks, they can be a great investment if you live in a space that struggles with reliable Wi-Fi coverage. Although neither extender offers an ethernet port, strategically placing the two extenders can still blanket your home with reliable internet, allowing for speeds of up to 500Mbps no matter where you are. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Eero Pro 6 review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TlkrAc"&gt;The base Apple Watch SE recently saw a healthy discount, but the larger, cellular-equipped version has now dropped to its best price ever. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5VZ3BS/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is offering the 44mm Apple Watch SE with cellular connectivity in silver with the navy sport loop for $299.99, a savings of $59. This is a fantastic deal for anyone who wants a bargain on a current Apple Watch, one that matches much of the performance of today’s flagship Series 6 and sports a larger display size than the Series 3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bVlSqC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10720656"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4zt6Ip"&gt;Also in the world of budget-friendly SE products from Apple is the iPhone SE (2020). This is the best bang-for-the-buck phone offering from Apple, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-2nd-Generation-64GB/dp/B08R988XHQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is offering an added discount on their “Renewed Premium” refurbished models. The red colorway with 64GB of storage clocks in at just $305, while the black and white models are $313 each. These phones are direct from Amazon and carry a one-year warranty. It assures that these iPhones are in like-new condition and with a minimum battery capacity of 90 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XN5Ivn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721721"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyaayC"&gt;Oh, hello there! If you made it here you’re in for a nice little treat, because the Xbox Series S console will be in stock very soon at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08G9J44ZN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $300, its full retail price. It’s not a deal, per se, but much like the Xbox Series X, Microsoft’s adorable speaker-looking Xbox console has been notoriously difficult to find. It’s not as powerful as its larger brethren and lacks a disc drive, but it fits just about anywhere due to its small size. It also boasts sharp looks, an excellent catalog of new and old titles, and targets up to 1440p resolution in games. You can easily order it and have it shipped to you very soon, no queuing up necessary. Hopefully, it’s a small sign that console shortages are beginning to wane, though we’re not holding our breath yet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That is a lot of storage for an SSD, and for today only it’s an all-time low at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1540697-REG%2Fsamsung_mu_pc2t0s_ww_2tb_t7_touch_portable.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F27%2F22643232%2Frazer-gaming-accessories-xbox-s-apple-iphone-watch-se-eero-6-mesh-router-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mK1n5k"&gt;Amazon Warehouse items are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=warehouse-deals&amp;amp;bbn=16059675011"&gt;20 percent off today&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to hunt around for some sweet pricing on used gear like the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, gaming headsets, or a keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GFwkN0"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro noise-canceling earbuds are on clearance at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1750207088602991622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $97.99&lt;/a&gt; in black. That’s a cool $32 off on the wireless, IPX4-rated buds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d2aD3c"&gt;On the other side of the listening spectrum, Sennheiser’s PXC 550-II headphones are now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPQQCVX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$156.59 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That is a heavy markdown from the original $349.95 price tag affixed to the noise-canceling headphones, and a new historical low. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j9V6Is"&gt;The midrange OnePlus Nord N10 5G, with its solid battery life and 90Hz refresh rate screen, is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Midnight-BE2026/dp/B08R7D4KZJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$279.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It was well reviewed at its regular price of $300, and a little extra savings doesn’t hurt. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ahNIKc"&gt;First-person photography game &lt;em&gt;Umurangi Generation&lt;/em&gt; was an indie darling in 2020, making it into many “best of” lists and even winning the grand prize at the IGF Awards this year. The Nintendo Switch version, which added optional motion controls to compose your shots, is currently on sale with its &lt;em&gt;Macro&lt;/em&gt; DLC on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/umurangi-generation-special-edition-switch/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo eShop for $17.49&lt;/a&gt;, 25 percent off the list price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UDYQSI"&gt;For some IRL photography action with fully tangible results, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630507-REG%2Ffujifilm_16696875_fujifilm_instax_40.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F27%2F22643232%2Frazer-gaming-accessories-xbox-s-apple-iphone-watch-se-eero-6-mesh-router-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B091D8C7RC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; both have the Fujifilm Instax Mini 40 for $10 off, bringing the instant film camera down to it’s lowest price at $89.95. The Mini 40, released in April, is the latest model to come from Fujifilm using the credit card-sized &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-INSTAX-Instant-Twin-Pack/dp/B00EB4ADQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Instax Mini film&lt;/a&gt; and features simple controls with a classic design.&lt;/li&gt;
