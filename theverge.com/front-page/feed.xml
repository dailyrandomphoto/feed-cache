    <title>Google is now requiring office workers to get weekly molecular COVID-19 tests</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The company is implementing new policies as COVID-19 cases rise across the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cVBhzE"&gt;Google will require anyone going to one of its US offices or facilities to have received a negative molecular test for COVID-19, the company informed employees Thursday in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/google-tells-anyone-coming-into-the-office-to-take-weekly-covid-tests.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;memo obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Workers going to the office regularly will have to get tested weekly, chief health officer Karen DeSalvo said in the memo, and employees have been asked to report their vaccination status&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and wear surgical-grade masks indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IxE4l"&gt;Google spokesperson Lora Lee Erickson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that a new temporary COVID-19 policy is now being implemented, one where “anyone accessing our sites in the US are expected to obtain a recent negative COVID-19 molecular test before coming onsite” and that it’s offering various kinds of tests at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kHOOB4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google offers at-home tests for employees&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBQlrt"&gt;Google offers free at-home testing to full-time employees and contract workers through BioIQ’s PCR-based nasal swab tests, Erickson said, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/google-staff-get-pricey-fast-covid-tests-while-contractors-wait"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this week that full-time employees also have access to molecular tests from Cue Health that can give results in just a few minutes. Contractors, on the other hand, are specifically being offered the mail-in BioIQ tests, according to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1480987095174766593"&gt;tweet from the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt;, which means they must wait longer for a result. Erickson tells us that some Google contractors at the company’s datacenters have access to rapid on-site testing using the Cue machines, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9BrsM"&gt;The changes arrive as COVID-19 cases have surged across the country and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/who-says-omicron-cases-are-off-the-charts-as-global-infections-set-new-records.html"&gt;as the omicron variant spreads&lt;/a&gt;. These new policies add to Google’s directive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22836575/google-unvaccinated-employees-mandate-unpaid-leave-termination-remote-work"&gt;from December&lt;/a&gt; requiring employees to get vaccinated or risk being forced to take leave and eventually be fired. The company delayed its mandatory return to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650639/google-mandatory-return-january-2022-remote-work"&gt;to some point this year&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qi4zls"&gt;This week, Meta also upped its health policies for employees, requiring anyone returning to its offices when they open at the end of March to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877332/meta-facebook-require-employees-covid-19-booster-vaccine-shot-return-office-reopening"&gt;received a booster dose of a vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s AI-powered scaling makes old games look better without a huge performance hit  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fYS1HiDS4A-eWoRyW7yqN3VweA=/282x0:3332x2033/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70392269/nvidia_dldsr_ai_deep_learning_dynamic_super_resolution_performance_image_quality_comparison.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia says its AI-powered upscaling is more powerful than regular super-resolution.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XS1j6s"&gt;Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgod-of-war-game-ready-driver%2F%3FlinkId%3D100000103579293&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest game-ready driver&lt;/a&gt; includes a tool that could let you improve the image quality of games that your graphics card can easily run, alongside optimizations for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22883541/god-of-war-pc-port-interview"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; PC port&lt;/a&gt;. The tech is called Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution, or DLDSR, and Nvidia says you can use it to make “most games” look sharper by running them at a higher resolution than your monitor natively supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFBHbr"&gt;DLDSR builds on Nvidia’s Dynamic Super Resolution tech, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/19/6502823/nvidia-and-amd-bring-out-their-big-new-guns-for-the-holidays"&gt;been around for years&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fdsr%2Ftechnology%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regular old DSR&lt;/a&gt; renders a game at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle and then downscales it to your monitor’s native resolution. This leads to an image with better sharpness but usually comes with a dip in performance (you are asking your GPU to do more work, after all). So, for instance, if you had a graphics card capable of running a game at 4K but only had a 1440p monitor, you could use DSR to get a boost in clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9Jyhly"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DLDSR takes DSR and adds AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sYMBBU"&gt;DLDSR takes the same concept and incorporates AI that can also work to enhance the image. According to Nvidia, this means you can upscale less (and therefore lose less performance) while still getting similar image quality improvements. In real numbers, Nvidia claims you’ll get image quality similar to running at four times the resolution using DSR with only 2.25 times the resolution with DLDSR. Nvidia gives an example using 2017’s &lt;em&gt;Prey: Digital Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;running on a 1080p monitor:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;4x&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;DSR runs at 108 FPS, while 2.25x DLDSR is getting 143 FPS, only two frames per second slower than running at native 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c74poS"&gt;Of course, you may want to take those impressive results with a grain of salt, as Nvidia’s obviously going to want to show one of the best-case examples. In the real world, you may get different results with different games, both in terms of FPS and what settings you have to run DLDSR in to get it looking crisp. Given its wider game support, though, you’ll probably be able to play around with it using one of your favorite older titles  — though you still will need an RTX card, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;aren’t exactly easy to get right now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TMRAju"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nvidia has had a lot of success with deep learning lately&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDRFfH"&gt;This isn’t the first time Nvidia’s used deep learning to improve image quality and performance — it’s gotten a lot of praise for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics"&gt;its Deep Learning Super Sampling&lt;/a&gt;, or DLSS, system. However, DLSS needs to be specifically supported by the game, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fdlss%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884124%2Fnvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;list of games you can use it with&lt;/a&gt; is relatively small (though, as of today, it includes the &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpq6KD"&gt;AMD, Nvidia’s graphics card competitor, has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866673/amd-radeon-super-resolution-software-ai-super-sampling-ces-2022"&gt;announced tech to improve performance and graphics&lt;/a&gt; on a wide array of games. It calls its approach Radeon Super Resolution, and while it doesn’t use exactly the same methods as DLSS or DLDSR (AMD has its own upscaling tech called &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/vsr"&gt;virtual super resolution&lt;/a&gt;), it’s aiming towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGvsGT"&gt;If you want to try out Nvidia’s DLDSR, update to the latest driver, then open up Nvidia Control Panel app. Go to Manage 3D Settings, click the DSR - Factors drop-down, and select one of the DL Scaling options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s critical Pixel 6 January update is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-kvqmfhip2vzuFHX3kE0wobOMMs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70391322/akrales_211020_4802_0471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The January update promises to fix numerous bugs reported by Pixel 6 owners.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IRabhh"&gt;Google is in the process of releasing a much-anticipated update for Pixel 6 phones. Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mishaalrahman/status/1482073557064638467"&gt;Android expert Mishaal Rahman noted&lt;/a&gt; that Google posted &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota"&gt;OTA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/images"&gt;factory images&lt;/a&gt; to its developer site for the January 2022 patch. That means anyone can sideload the update to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; now, and the official over-the-air update has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1482098746779447305"&gt;already arrived on some devices&lt;/a&gt; (including some owned by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crc7jX"&gt;In an email, Google confirmed the rollout has begun, and that the software will automatically roll out over the next week, depending on your device and wireless carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBcYtF"&gt;Using the phones’ built-in checker may start the process now, and if it doesn’t, &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/welcome"&gt;sideloading&lt;/a&gt; is still an option. However, waiting for the regular rollout instead of doing a manual install may be the best way to go, given the trouble caused by December’s update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26RgBb"&gt;This patch includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;numerous bug fixes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;a few new features&lt;/a&gt; that Pixel 6 owners have been anxiously awaiting. It’s supposed to tweak the fingerprint sensor, camera, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788072/google-pixel-6-stand-wireless-charging-fast-23w-qi"&gt;23W wireless charging with the second-generation Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;. On the Pixel 6 Pro, you can use its ultra-wideband chip for digital car key access to compatible BMWs. This update also adds the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734993/pixel-6-snapchat-feature-tap-camera"&gt;Quick Tap to Snap&lt;/a&gt;” integration that Google and Snapchat touted during the devices’ launch event and new bass controls for the Pixel Buds A-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXwjy1"&gt;Google originally intended to ship those features in the December update but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;halted and ultimately removed the files&lt;/a&gt; from its site when users complained of connectivity troubles after installing the patch. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that the January update has fixes for those bugs, and includes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/139017133/google-pixel-update-december-2021?hl=en"&gt;the December update’s fixes&lt;/a&gt; to address bugs that have driven &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?s=20"&gt;at least one well-known Pixel 6 user&lt;/a&gt; to ditch the phone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uUwIo"&gt;With the images public and &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2022/01/14/pixel-6-january-update-release-date/"&gt;one Canadian telecom company&lt;/a&gt; citing Monday, January 17th for the release, we thought the patch would arrive next week, but it’s already here. That’s none too soon for people who bought the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro expecting to get a premium device. While the hardware is truly flagship-level, the software experience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22881882/android-12-google-pixel-6-pro-bugs-oneplus-oxygenos-12-samsung-one-ui-4-update"&gt;hasn’t always been smooth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS9v0s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 4:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the update is rolling out now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3HM1V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 4:55PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Google’s confirmation of the update, and that it includes both the December and January changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House says COVIDTests website will distribute free rapid tests starting January 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axfACWQk7alU8K1psz5dgmX2Bh4=/58x0:1807x1166/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70391114/Screen_Shot_2022_01_14_at_11.41.43.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site is live, but you won’t be able to order tests until Wednesday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sHGd6n"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1482072719688712204?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that people will be able to order free COVID-19 tests from &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; starting on Wednesday, January 19th. This follows a promise that the government would be setting up a website to distribute 500 million tests, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848887/joe-biden-google-free-covid-test-near-me"&gt;President Joe Biden announced in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPUV8X"&gt;You’ll only have to put in two pieces of info to get a test shipped to you — your name and address. In its announcement, the White House said the tests will ship through the US Postal Service “within 7–12 days of ordering.” Currently, the limit is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;four tests per residential address.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="SYOBT6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;To order their tests, the only two things people will need are their name and residential mailing address. Tests will typically ship through the mail within 7-12 days of ordering, and be delivered First Class through the U.S. Postal Service.&lt;/p&gt;— The White House (@WhiteHouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1482072719688712204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F4idES"&gt;On Wednesday of this week, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880467/white-house-covid-coronavirus-testing-website-order-rapid-tests"&gt;White House advisor said&lt;/a&gt; the site “should be online by this weekend.” Technically, the government has made that deadline — you can visit &lt;a href="https://covidtests.gov"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt; right now, though it’s currently showing a landing page letting you know that tests will be available Wednesday and that you won’t have to put in a credit card number to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NC6XBD"&gt;The USPS isn’t just responsible for getting the tests to people. It was also tapped to develop a website that will have to deal with potentially millions of people trying to get a test at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/white-house-covid-test-website"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report cites a government official who said that it’s “taking our website launch very seriously” and that it “didn’t start from scratch” building the site. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5992087/us-digital-service-created-to-prevent-tech-debacles-like-healthcare-gov"&gt;US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; will also be helping to launch the site and provide support when needed, &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMYH0l"&gt;Given the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/us-world/2013/12/3/5163228/healthcare-gov-obamacare-website-shows-how-government-can-do-tech-better"&gt;less-than-stellar reputation with launching healthcare websites&lt;/a&gt;, there’s some skepticism about whether the site will be able to handle the traffic — and some have rightfully pointed out that some of the most vulnerable people could have difficulties getting online and navigating a website. A &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/14/fact-sheet-the-biden-administration-to-begin-distributing-at-home-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-americans-for-free/"&gt;statement from the White House&lt;/a&gt; says that you’ll also be able to call a hotline to order tests if you’re unable to access the website and that the government will “work with national and local community-based organizations to support the nation’s hardest-hit and highest-risk communities in requesting tests.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is reportedly investigating Meta’s VR division for antitrust violations</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvSStx"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission and at least three states are investigating Meta for antitrust violations in its virtual reality division, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/meta-s-oculus-unit-faces-ftc-led-probe-of-competition-practices?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report says the FTC and attorneys general from New York, Tennessee, and North Carolina began speaking last year with third-party VR developers who have concerns about Meta’s business practices. It’s one of multiple probes into Meta’s dominance in the small but growing market of VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoFoxu"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report references &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;well-known controversies&lt;/a&gt; around Meta (formerly Facebook) and its VR division (formerly Oculus). Regulators have reportedly asked developers if the Oculus app store discriminates against third-party apps whose features overlap with its own offerings, and they’ve apparently questioned Meta’s strategy of selling the Meta Quest (formerly Oculus Quest) headset at a $299 price point that heavily undercuts the price of other VR headsets. The FTC declined to comment on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwMFXL"&gt;The FTC has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840635/ftc-opens-antitrust-probe-meta-deal-vr-fitness-app-supernatural"&gt;allegedly already opened a probe&lt;/a&gt; into Meta’s acquisition of Within, the company behind VR fitness app Supernatural. The US Justice Department also &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/facebook-accused-of-squeezing-rival-startups-in-virtual-reality"&gt;reportedly investigated similar claims&lt;/a&gt; in late 2020. German regulators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167509/germany-fco-investigation-facebook-oculus-account-requirements-competition"&gt;publicly announced&lt;/a&gt; an investigation around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6QjAJ"&gt;So far, VR has still gotten little attention compared to other Meta divisions. The FTC is currently pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the company over its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp; after a setback last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery"&gt;a judge revived the suit&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. But as Meta has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;begun emphasizing its role&lt;/a&gt; as a steward of a VR-heavy “metaverse,” the area may invite more legal scrutiny as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix raises prices on all plans in US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyxncmndfLi0VleZNgfm9mp1WXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70390996/acastro_211025_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C16tBa"&gt;Netflix is &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926"&gt;raising prices across all of its plans in the US&lt;/a&gt; today. The company’s standard plan will rise to $15.50 per month from $14, while the 4K plan will rise to $20 per month from $18. The basic plan, which doesn’t include HD, is also rising to $10 per month from $9. Prices are rising in Canada as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wQhb"&gt;The price hikes go into effect immediately for new subscribers. For existing subscribers, the changes will be rolled out “gradually,” with Netflix promising to email members 30 days before the price hike goes into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SC4OM0"&gt;Prices for a Netflix plan have steadily gone up in recent years. The standard plan went to $14 per month from $13 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, after previously rising to $13 from from $11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183602/netflix-subscription-price-raise-us-streaming-plans"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to that, Netflix raised prices in 2017 and 2015. When Netflix announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5698782/netflix-streaming-price-increases"&gt;its first wide-scale price increase in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the company was so worried about losing subscribers over a $1 per month bump that it let existing members keep their price for two years. It hasn’t offered such a generous perk in the years since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E5t1o2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10978542"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sMK9f"&gt;The price hikes come during a successful but challenging moment for Netflix. The company already has a wealth of subscribers across the US, and adding more is a challenge — making price hikes an obvious answer for how it can make more money. At the same time, Netflix is now competing with several other serious streaming services for attention, including Disney Plus and HBO Max, and it’s been spending big on content to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6t0E6"&gt;“We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options,” a Netflix spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-netflix-raises-monthly-subscription-prices-us-canada-2022-01-14/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0rSMN"&gt;Netflix isn’t the only service that’s been raising prices lately. Hulu &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney"&gt;hiked the price&lt;/a&gt; of its ad-supported and ad-free tiers by $1 per month in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmzEd8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; is currently producing a series with Netflix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QMqIk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero could be close to launching a Wi-Fi 6E mesh networking system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lL0gzvn1wIbpwbygomaFJ1hJkqU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70390601/dseifert_201213_4337_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero might be upgrading its Pro line to support Wi-Fi 6E.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GtDfNT"&gt;Amazon-owned Eero seems to be close to announcing new routers sometime soon, as new FCC filings appeared this week for devices that appear to be called the &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AEM4-41123474"&gt;Eero 6 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AEM4-71213573"&gt;Eero Pro 6E&lt;/a&gt;. That 6E branding for the Pro could indicate it will support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can take advantage of 6GHz spectrum for faster connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLMjFE"&gt;Router makers have slowly been introducing Wi-Fi 6E-capable mesh routers, though some have been quite expensive, such as this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716979/netgear-orbi-quad-band-wi-fi-6e-mesh-router-release-date-specs-price"&gt;$1,500 Orbi system from Netgear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linksys.com%2Fus%2Fwhole-home-mesh-wifi%2Flinksys-atlas-max-6e-tri-band-mesh-wifi-6e-system-3-pack%2Fp%2Fp-mx8503%2F%3Fclickid%3D36b3a%253A2PexyIUh4UCrRRW3yQUkG3CmQ9RxvqzA0%26utm_campaign%3DOnline%2520Tracking%2520Link%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dimpactradius&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F14%2F22884043%2Feero-pro-6e-6-plus-fcc-filings-wi-fi-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Linksys’ $1,200 option&lt;/a&gt;. While we don’t know how much Eero’s 6E-capable system could cost, it could be more affordable than those options, given that a 3-pack for the Eero 6 Pro launched at $599.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITyDXG"&gt;The new router names show up on labels Eero included in the filings. On the labels, the Eero 6 Plus has a &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AEM4-41123474/Label/Label-Info-5598273"&gt;model number of R010001&lt;/a&gt;, while the Eero Pro 6E’s &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/2AEM4-71213573/Label/2AEM4-71213573-Label-Sample-5595249"&gt;model number is S010001&lt;/a&gt; — both of which didn’t show up as currently available devices when I googled them. The new names suggest these routers might be more iterative upgrades or get slotted in alongside the currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21451035/amazon-new-eero-mesh-wi-fi-gear-wifi-6-price-release-date"&gt;Eero 6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Eero Pro 6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Sonos lawsuit dodge might let other phone makers do what Pixel cannot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ajKVKUMVra79RRM9HiIk0WMZY0=/58x156:1666x1228/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70390428/cwelch_191016_3737_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WFtwxZ"&gt;You might think a Google phone would be the best choice to control your Google-branded speakers, but that’s not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; true: Google’s actions have potentially opened the door for other manufacturers to do what the Pixel legally cannot, &lt;a href="https://blog.esper.io/android-12-cast-volume-changes-explained"&gt;writes Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman at Esper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIuYbl"&gt;Last week, we wrote how “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871304/google-home-speaker-group-volume-control-changes-sonos-patent-decision"&gt;Your Google home speakers are about to get slightly worse because Sonos sued and won&lt;/a&gt;.” If you’re using a Google Pixel, that’s true — among other things, you won’t be able to control the volume of a multi-zone Google Cast speaker group. That’s because the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"&gt;ruled that Google copied Sonos’ technology and threatened to block imports&lt;/a&gt; unless Google implemented five specific software tweaks. One of the Sonos patents specifically dealt with controlling volume of a multi-zone speaker group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnRml7"&gt;But when Rahman dug into the Android 12 code, he found that the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; Google disabled remote speaker group volume control is incredibly basic: Google simply set a single value from “true” to “false” on its own Pixel phones. Rahman writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ns5C8p"&gt;the second patch seems tailored to allow Google to ship Pixel phones without the ability to control the volume of remote speaker group sessions. But it also leaves an easy way for OEMs to ship their own devices with the feature enabled. All an OEM would have to do is build AOSP with GMS and leave the default value (‘true’) for the config_volumeAdjustmentForRemoteGroupSessions flag in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rOt9Xi"&gt;It sounds like if Samsung or Xiaomi (currently the world’s top two Android manufacturers) want their phones to control the volume of an entire speaker group (something a Google Pixel can no longer do as of the latest update), they don’t have to lift any additional fingers. They just have to avoid intentionally turning it off. And Rahman says that — at least in beta — the upcoming Android 12L works this way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziko65"&gt;(For the uninitiated, “build AOSP with GMS” simply means to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;the basic version of Android&lt;/a&gt; that Google offers free to manufacturers, with the Google services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194803/android-google-play-services-huawei-china"&gt;that the company generally licenses with it&lt;/a&gt;, which is what most Android phone makers do anyhow before they skin Android with additions of their own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcfDuW"&gt;None of this means that any phone maker will necessarily take Google up on this possibility. For all I know — I am not a lawyer — Sonos could just turn around and sue them, too, using its victory against Google as precedent. But it’s all very intriguing to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai were involved in ad collusion plot, claims court filing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eidkBoifkb2n3GlyrtR921n_UyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70390288/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkPnkv"&gt;On Friday, a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a new antitrust complaint (&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21179902-3rd-complaint-for-texas-google-antitrust-case"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) against Google, giving more details into the company’s alleged collusion with Facebook in programmatic ad markets. The filing was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/14/facebook-google-ad-market-lawsuit-527108"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXiiGx"&gt;First filed in November, the initial complaint (&lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/images/TAC%20-%20Redacted%20Version%20(public).pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) alleged broad collusion between the two companies, particularly in a collaborative project codenamed “Jedi Blue” that saw the companies joining together to limit header bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z62agv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this is a big deal strategically”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxdnJU"&gt;Drawing on internal emails, Friday’s complaint shows that the Jedi Blue deal was reviewed at the highest levels of both companies, with personal involvement from Sundar Pichai, Sheryl Sandberg, and Mark Zuckerberg. In one email to Zuckerberg, Sandberg told the CEO “[t]his is a big deal strategically.” Notably, the filing refers to Zuckerberg and Sandberg by their job titles but redacts their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukrunR"&gt;Reached for comment, Google referred to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-misleading-attack-on-our-ad-tech-business/"&gt;a previous statement&lt;/a&gt; on the lawsuit, and specifically denied the claim that Pichai had been personally involved in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiSPIe"&gt;“AG Paxton’s assertion isn’t accurate,” said Google representative Peter Schottenfels. “We sign hundreds of agreements every year that don’t require CEO approval, and this was no different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ksync"&gt;“Contrary to AG Paxton’s claims, the fact of this agreement was never a secret — it was &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.facebook.com_audiencenetwork_news-2Dand-2Dinsights_continued-2Dmomentum-2Dfor-2Daudience-2Dnetwork-2Dbidding&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=n3mIzkOWZO_-RV9DVUt2PtCt4P%E2%80%94APWP0jYUcwgY-Og&amp;amp;m=qdPg0b2x42hwzs0s5zWtFNQgfW7UxqYUSNBpbXbqCc75bR30tjHwiFVHamIWrD4E&amp;amp;s=P8pzUNQthY_aLd38gXMhvUNgMTZtDHahlqwIINDKhUk&amp;amp;e="&gt;well-publicized&lt;/a&gt;,” Shottenfels continued. “It simply enables FAN and the advertisers it represents to participate in Open Bidding, just like over 25 other partners do. That helps increase demand for publisher ad space and helps publishers earn more revenue, as we explain &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__blog.google_outreach-2Dinitiatives_public-2Dpolicy_ag-2Dpaxtons-2Dmisleading-2Dattack-2Don-2Dour-2Dad-2Dtech-2Dbusiness_&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=n3mIzkOWZO_-RV9DVUt2PtCt4P%E2%80%94APWP0jYUcwgY-Og&amp;amp;m=qdPg0b2x42hwzs0s5zWtFNQgfW7UxqYUSNBpbXbqCc75bR30tjHwiFVHamIWrD4E&amp;amp;s=9aGe6yg7aDP-OdDsd-E6LpfBOgDsyDO0TJ06Fjb88ZM&amp;amp;e="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJqIva"&gt;The legal implications of the allegations are still contested, and the distinction between normal business practices and anti-competitive behavior will be hotly debated in court. Still, the state attorneys general succeed in digging up a number of moments where the two ad giants seem to be settling into a collaborative duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoulbT"&gt;In one particularly uncomfortable passage, the complaint quotes a 2015 email in which “Google employees expressed fear that Google’s exchange might ‘actually have to compete’ with other exchanges at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDvvgN"&gt;Much of the case rests on the concessions Google allegedly made to Facebook in the wake of the Jedi Blue arrangement, including lower fees and longer timeout limits in exchange bidding. One newly unredacted portion of the complaint claims that the concessions gave Facebook a clear advantage in winning auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oVO8KI"&gt;One Facebook study in 2019 found that Facebook’s bids for in-app impressions won more frequently in Google-run auctions than they did on any other platform. At the same time, the average price Facebook paid per in-app impression was lower in Google-run auctions than it was on any other platform. This would be a puzzling result, to say the least, if Facebook faced the same competition for inventory across auction houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8hmxJ"&gt;The case comes amid a range of antitrust actions against Google, including parallel antitrust cases focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;search manipulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;its management of the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. But the complaint led by Texas is arguably the most important for the company, focusing on the programmatic ad networks that have long provided the bulk of the company’s revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgbG5e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included Google statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bethesda will follow up Fallout 4’s real-life Pip-Boy with this Starfield smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3ZK6m271U7-6Ja1pGr-pwDGhiw=/168x0:1461x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70389610/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_17.57.35.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="egqIB3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;, Bethesda’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;upcoming space-themed game&lt;/a&gt;, may feature an in-game smartwatch that you’ll be able to get and wear in real life, based on an early copy of a manual &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/s2qbap/new_images_of_the_watch_i_found_along_with_draft/"&gt;found by Reddit user SquiddyVonn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://manuals.plus/the-wand-company/lpv6-chronomark-smartwatch-manual"&gt;The manual&lt;/a&gt; details the real-life watch’s functions, which include showing the weather and step tracking, and it even includes pictures that give us a good look at the interface. It also shows us that the watch is being made by a well-known replica company that’s &lt;a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/collections/wand-company"&gt;worked with Bethesda in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58VtHk"&gt;According to “The Wand Company LPV6 Chronomark Smartwatch User Manual,” the watch will be able to receive forecast information from a phone, display notifications, and show various sets of information on a series of watch faces. It also shows the watch’s “About” menu, which contains the line “©2022 Bethesda Softworks, a ZeniMax Media company.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuVuPLw6po_NPRlQmGHz37mZ5h0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167912/THE_WAND_COMPANY_LPV6_Chronomark_Smartwatch_FIg_4.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch’s “Sunrise, sunset and moon phase” screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KCh3AQ"&gt;If the name “The Wand Company” rings a bell, it may be because of its work on other replicas — taking something that exists in a game, movie, or TV show and making a real-life version of it is kind of its thing. The company has made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/11/8933329/star-trek-tos-bluetooth-communicator-hands-on-sdcc-2015"&gt;Star Trek communicator replicas&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to make calls (though they use a Bluetooth connection to your phone, rather than far-future tech) and poké ball models that light up when you get your hand near them (but that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726725/pokemon-pokeball-collectible-metal-motion-activated-do-not-throw"&gt;you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; throw&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3LYE4alehDPDLnS7553G2byBbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167858/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_17.44.25.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the watch from Bethesda’s video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4TFIj"&gt;While the manual gives us a good look at the watch, it’s not the first time we’ve seen it. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-manual-and-images-of-a-starfield-collectors-edition-watch-have-been-spotted/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it also made a brief appearance in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Wun9up_M87E?t=91"&gt;a behind-the-scenes video from Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, which was posted in June 2021 (it’s featured right around the 1:33 mark). The video version looks pretty much identical to the one seen in the manual, and the box it comes in appears to be a replica of a box found in the game’s teaser trailer — that could be another hint that the watch will have some sort of role in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4hv6Zl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10977258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="beGfDj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;slated to launch on November 11th&lt;/a&gt; for the PC and Xbox Series consoles. If the watch is set to be part of a collector’s edition, we’ll probably hear more about it before then.&lt;/p&gt;
