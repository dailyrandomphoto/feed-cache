    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbUXCe"&gt;Target has restocked the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$499.99 standard PS5 console&lt;/a&gt;, and may have the $399.99 Digital Edition available later. Unlike other retailers, Target doesn’t require an account or special subscription to access these restocks, so they’ll be dished out on a first-come, first-serve basis. Additionally, there is no queue system in place on the Target store, so your best best is to continually attempt to add the console to your cart and head to checkout as quickly as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqFnjG"&gt;Another potential avenue you could explore is downloading the Target app on your mobile device, which might just give you the edge you need to snag a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeUdjz"&gt;Don’t stress if you happen to miss out, as retailers generally restock at least once a week. We’re always on the lookout for the best deals, so make sure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for bi-weekly highlights of all the best discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We regret to inform you that Apple now verifies anyone asking for educational discounts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5Ies2"&gt;Apple has introduced a new verification process in the US to ensure that customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. It’s not clear exactly when its policy changed, but &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;at some point this month&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; noticed that Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/education-pricing"&gt;education pricing page&lt;/a&gt; was updated to note that customers will now be checked &lt;a href="https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US/partners/appleeducationstore/spotlight/online"&gt;by Unidays&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party verification service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;As well as requiring Unidays, Apple is also placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. Given that’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as an illicit discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gasaqa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aLqaON"&gt;Requiring Unidays verification matches a similar process Apple already uses in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;some countries like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, as of this writing, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/store"&gt;Apple’s Canada store&lt;/a&gt; is yet to be updated to mention Unidays, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/19/apple-us-education-store-verification/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change removes a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit (apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have an .edu email address) there’s surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This controller turns your Android phone into a portable Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good solution for mobile Game Pass games... or at least some of them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="92GeMI"&gt;It seems unlikely that Microsoft will ever make a portable Xbox. Between Sony’s failure with the Vita, Nintendo’s dominance of the market with the Switch, and Microsoft’s device-agnostic business model, there isn’t really much need for such a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPRfa3"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s no demand for portable Xbox games, though. Microsoft has been pushing cloud gaming hard with Xbox Game Pass, as well as the ability to stream games directly from your own Xbox console to your phone. And even though a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813749/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-touch-controls-stats"&gt;surprising number of players&lt;/a&gt; are doing this with touchscreen controls — I know people who swear by the touch version of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, believe it or not — it’s not an ideal setup for most Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljy59s"&gt;That’s why I was interested to try the RIG MG-X, a mobile controller from Nacon. It’s an officially licensed Xbox controller that works with just about any Android phone, giving it all the buttons you’d find on a standard Xbox One pad. This should make it a good fit for Game Pass games on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yuk8Fx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10988921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="237Ui6"&gt;Mobile controllers aren’t a new idea, and there are solid options for Android out there already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;like the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt; — including a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.razer.com%2Fap-en%2Fgaming-controllers%2Frazer-kishi&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F21%2F22894588%2Fnacon-rig-mg-x-review-xbox-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently released Xbox-specific version&lt;/a&gt;. The RIG MG-X, though, has an appealingly straightforward design for a product category that can be a little awkward, which makes for a sleeker approach when coupled with the Xbox buttons. It’s nice not to have to think about which icons map to which commands; you can just naturally use the same buttons you’d have on a conventional Xbox setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMHOfZ"&gt;The controller has a gap in the middle that extends out to clamp around your phone, which connects over Bluetooth. Nacon says it should work with any phone running Android 6 and above with a screen up to 6.7 inches; I mostly used it with a Vivo X70 Pro Plus, which is a giant phone with a 6.78-inch screen, and it works fine. (It does not, however, work with iPhones at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W1GS06"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bluetooth is a trade-off I’m okay with&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x73HKp"&gt;This is quite a chunky device, and it’s wider than an Xbox controller even before you extend it to insert your phone. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — it feels well-built and and I wouldn’t have a problem tossing it into a bag when traveling. The use of Bluetooth instead of a USB-C connector is a trade-off I’m okay with, because it makes for a more compatible design and ensures the controller can be used with the phone in a case. It does mean that you have to manually pair with the phone, though, and charge the controller itself over USB-C from time to time; Nacon quotes around 20 hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcCHId"&gt;Overall, the RIG MG-X’s controls are small but effective. The analog sticks aren’t as big as a full-size Xbox controller’s, but they’re bigger than a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con’s and feel more satisfying to use. The face buttons are also quite small but tactile and clicky, while the D-pad is accurate enough despite being a little mushier than I’d prefer. I have big hands and I found the RIG MG-X to have reasonably good ergonomics over time for most games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/13Ug_-3zq2hC3bJTSff4TluciaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184163/IMG_1854.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The RIG MG-X’s triggers are its biggest flaw.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GYgtaC"&gt;There is one exception, though, when it comes to the triggers. For some reason they’re unusually difficult to press in all the way, which is a big problem for games like racers where you need to hold them down a lot. A game like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you’re regularly making individual squeezes to fire weapons is okay, but I was wondering why I was losing so many races in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; before figuring out that I didn’t have my foot pressed firmly enough on the gas. You can do it, but it takes more force than any other controller I’ve ever used, and it’s not at all comfortable for extended play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DSpRO"&gt;It’s unfortunate that this isn’t a good &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; controller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;you may have heard that it’s a pretty good game&lt;/a&gt; — but it does work well for most other genres. You can use it for non-Xbox games, of course, whether they’re from the Play Store or elsewhere — I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; with it, and you even get native Xbox button indicators in the menus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kwWJX"&gt;The RIG MG-X is a decent controller with a single big flaw, so just know what you’re getting into if you’re a fan of racing games. I happen to be one, so that was disappointing for me, and I’d personally go with the Xbox version of the Razer Kishi for that reason. But for lots of other Xbox games, this is a solid solution that gets you closer to a portable Xbox than ever before, and other than the triggers I prefer its design to the Kishi. This month Nacon also announced the MG-X Pro, which looks much more like a standard Xbox controller — hopefully the triggers are better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel selects Ohio for ‘largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTo7vDh3bfsIUEFVjwCzx67z9tc=/0x0:2012x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415296/Intel_fabrication_plants_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the planned site.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HG5t08"&gt;Chip manufacturer Intel will spend at least $20 billion on a new chip manufacturing site in New Albany, near Columbus, Ohio, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220121005066/en/Intel-Announces-Next-US-Site-with-Landmark-Investment-in-Ohio/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;the company announced today.&lt;/a&gt; The 1,000-acre location will initially play host to two chip factories, and is set to directly employ at least 3,000 people and “tens of thousands” more across suppliers and partners. Construction is reportedly due to kick off this year, with the site becoming operational in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJik4O"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://time.com/6140476/intel-building-factory-ohio/?s=09"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company expects the site to become “the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet,” adding that it could eventually expand to 2,000 acres with eight fabs. After helping to establish Silicon Valley, Gelsinger said the new site could become “the Silicon Heartland.” Intel plans to invest up to $100 billion in the site over the next decade, as well as around $100 million in partnership with Ohio universities, colleges, and the US National Science Foundation to foster new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ex1tAp"&gt;Intel already has US factories across several states including Oregon, New Mexico, and Arizona. Ohio represents its first manufacturing expansion into a new state in over 40 years, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/technology/intel-to-invest-at-least-20-billion-in-new-chip-factories-in-ohio.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Intel has been aggressively ramping up its investments in manufacturing capacity under its new CEO, who’s already announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;$20 billion expansion&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s existing Arizona complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tu1Xw8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel wants it to become “the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vpbQP"&gt;Expanding into a state without an existing chip manufacturing presence brings challenges, like acquiring the correct permits, raw materials and supplies, and production machines, the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;notes. But New Albany is known for its inexpensive land, and any manufacturing plant could benefit from engineering graduates at nearby Ohio State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ed156"&gt;Intel’s search for its new manufacturing hub reportedly saw states competing for the huge economic opportunity a new plant represents. &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; reports that at least one other state offered more subsidies, but Ohio was a better regulatory fit and Intel didn’t want to displace current residents. It’s a marked contrast from Amazon’s hyper-competitive bidding process that eventually awarded a second HQ to New York, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224993/amazon-hq-2-queens-new-york-backlash-pulls-drops"&gt;it shelved&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from residents and local lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pzmwuSzbUCSmwlLCC_ogIFaqGXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184254/Intel_Expansion_Ohio_4.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqrM0Rx-VODTtedCuhj-3Q-bS-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184255/Intel_Expansion_Ohio_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the planned factories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFczFl"&gt;The announcement comes as the world continues to grapple with an acute shortage of computer chips that has impacted everyone from games console manufacturers to automakers. The shortage has shed light on the decades-long shift of chip manufacturing from the US and Europe to Asian countries, particularly Taiwan where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in headquartered. To help reverse the shift, the US Senate approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;a $52 billion subsidy package&lt;/a&gt; for the chip industry last June which would offer grants to companies building new US factories, but it is yet to pass through the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfD16R"&gt;Intel’s competitors TSMC and Samsung have announced new US-based manufacturing investments of their own in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22245325/samsung-building-chipmaking-fab-texas-taylor"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. But in some officials’ eyes, Intel has the advantage of being a homegrown US company, while TSMC’s proximity to China has worried Pentagon officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Faf5hc"&gt;“Today’s investment marks another significant way Intel is leading the effort to restore U.S. semiconductor manufacturing leadership,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger in a statement. “Intel’s actions will help build a more resilient supply chain and ensure reliable access to advanced semiconductors for years to come. Intel is bringing leading capability and capacity back to the United States to strengthen the global semiconductor industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8Wher"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 5:39AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Intel’s official announcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard boss details what the studio is doing to ‘rebuild your trust’</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard chief Mike Ybarra posted a blog about the changes on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNXzeQ"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment, the developer of huge franchises like &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, has been under intense scrutiny since California sued parent company Activision Blizzard last summer over allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;fostering a culture of harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to assure employees and fans that the company is making positive changes, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23763775/putting-our-teams-and-players-at-the-forefront-of-everything-we-do"&gt;published a blog post detailing&lt;/a&gt; what it is doing to “rebuild your trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBPUHs"&gt;At the top of the list is that executive and management teams will be measured “directly against culture improvement,” which means that their compensation will “depend on our overall success in creating a safe, inclusive, and creative work environment at Blizzard,” Ybarra says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHhjr6"&gt;He also outlined new full-time roles that have been created to help improve culture, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wvo190"&gt;a Culture leader who will help us maintain the best aspects of what we have today, and change and evolve where needed to ensure everyone brings their best self to Blizzard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3qvLT"&gt;a new organizational leader for Human Resources who will build trust, empower our teams, and help foster a safe, positive work environment for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5FNnp"&gt;a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;amp;I) leader solely focused on our progress across multiple efforts in this area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gtLCS4"&gt;Blizzard has also “tripled” the size of its compliance and investigation teams, shared representation data internally (which was not included with the blog post), set goals for improving those metrics (also not shared), and created an “upward feedback program” for employees to evaluate managers, Ybarra said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fymY4i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're committed to more open dialog directly with the amazing player communities - not just from me but from all of our incredible teams. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5MUILlUCnS"&gt;https://t.co/5MUILlUCnS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1484296085526827011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcZ71D"&gt;Ybarra’s blog about these initiatives arrives under the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft’s massive deal to acquire Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft appears to have gone into the deal with eyes wide open about Activision Blizzard’s recent scandals, and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer even nodded to culture changes to come in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889393/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-activision-blizzard-email"&gt;an email to staff&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vUTkmS"&gt;We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qBAE8m"&gt;It’s also worth noting that Ybarra was a nearly 20-year veteran of Microsoft before &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/24/mike-ybarra-joins-blizzard-after-years-as-xbox-services-boss/"&gt;he joined Blizzard in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UM0WtO"&gt;However, there could still be a lot of work to do to address concerns from Activision Blizzard employees. Ybarra was originally put in place as a co-lead of Blizzard alongside Jen Oneal after former president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;J. Allen Brack left shortly following the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, but Oneal stepped down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;just three months after taking the role&lt;/a&gt;. During her time as co-lead, Oneal “sent an email to a member of Activision’s legal team in which she professed a lack of faith in Activision’s leadership to turn the culture around,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report from November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx0jIL"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/17/warzone-bugs-raven-qa-strike/"&gt;several dozen&lt;/a&gt; workers have been on strike for weeks to protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;surprise layoffs of QA staffers at Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;. And as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1484298295589675014"&gt;Ethan Gach pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, Ybarra’s blog doesn’t address demands from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abetterabk/status/1433466353726361603"&gt;ABK Workers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, an employee advocacy group. That said, some Activision Blizzard employees are optimistic about the Microsoft acquisition, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/activision-employees-say-they-re-optimistic-about-acquisition?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIFpPS"&gt;Ybarra also tacitly acknowledged Blizzard’s lack of recent big releases, a problem that was exacerbated after &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760118/activision-blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-and-diablo-4-again"&gt;delayed in November with no release dates in sight&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds as if we could learn more about the studio’s games sometime next week. “We also know we need to deliver content to our players on a more regular basis and innovate both in and beyond our existing games,” Ybarra said. “We have some exciting things to announce, and I’ll be sharing more next week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGqCWv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n937KB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVfVPl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is thinking about letting its creators charge subscription fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWtkbojXPZEVAg_famW1NG6jyKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414413/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok is testing paid subscriptions | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcQ1ZV"&gt;TikTok confirmed Thursday that it is testing support for paid subscriptions, paving the way for creators on the short form video platform to charge for their content. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-is-testing-paid-subscriptions?irclickid=zbUwjW3d9xyIWX6XC8ydcwL-UkG3-OWhIz0czs0&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2334778-Linkbux&amp;amp;utm_term="&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company didn’t share details about when it might roll out to creators, how many creators are currently testing it, or what the pay structure might look like. Company spokesman Zachary Kizer said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the subscriptions were a “concept that’s been in testing,” and that it was “always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” (whatever that means). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5cNx6"&gt;If adopted, it would be the latest move by TikTok to help its creators monetize their content; it introduced its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next"&gt;Creator Next hub&lt;/a&gt; with monetization tools, and rolled out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811973/tiktok-creator-next-monetization-tips-video-gifts"&gt;tipping feature to eligible creators in December&lt;/a&gt;, after testing it with a smaller group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4ZwA9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if creators are holding their best content for subscribers, will it fuel the algorithm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ujiTKA"&gt;How TikTok will add direct-to-creator payments to its highly successful business model is bit of a head-scratcher. The app’s major advantage over competitors is its uncanny algorithm that surfaces content to users’ For You pages. It’s a way for creators to reach users and ideally turn them into subscribers. But if creators are holding their best content for subscribers, that content is probably not available to fuel the algorithm, which in turn could reduce engagement, since in theory, it’s not being surfaced to non-subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHMz3m"&gt;This is not a problem unique to TikTok, of course; all digital &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; trying to help content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323398/facebook-stories-ads-stickers-creator-monetize-update"&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt; and influencers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;monetize&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822042/discord-premium-memberships-creators-monetize-servers-feature"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; are trying to balance engagement vs. letting creators monetize directly. And the creators themselves have to be able to predict what content subscribers will be willing to pay for, and what content will help them best promote their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTOrfZ"&gt;TikTok’s test of paid subscribers follows Instagram’s announcement that it, too, &lt;a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/subscriptions-creators-instagram-recurring-monthly-income/"&gt;is launching a test of paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a small number of creators and influencers. Subscribers will pay a monthly fee to access exclusive content from creators they follow, including Stories and Live videos. The different tiers will range in price from $0.99 to $99.99 per month depending what the creator decides to charge, and a purple badge will denote a subscriber’s status to the creator/influencer in the comments section. Meta-owned Instagram says it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891722/instagram-paid-subscriptions-test"&gt;doesn’t plan to take a cut&lt;/a&gt; of creators’ subscription revenue until next year at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix co-CEO says there will ‘absolutely’ be a second season of Squid Game </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60epGcAzUh3ymfwW8OYXHm_tDpM=/0x200:3860x2773/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414392/SquidGame_Unit_101_1792.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9iUjq"&gt;Hold on to your jumpsuits — Netflix’s wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; series has been confirmed by the company for a second season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNODlK"&gt;During its fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, Netflix’s co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirmed that the Korean miniseries is returning. Asked by Nidhi Gupta of Fidelity Management and Research whether the viewers would get a second season of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;Netflix’s most popular series&lt;/a&gt; ever, Sarados said there’s more grisly action to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="endAPG"&gt;“Absolutely,” he responded. “The &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; universe has just begun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGohEz"&gt;Previously, Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772170/squid-game-season-two-netflix-director-confirms"&gt;series would return&lt;/a&gt;, adding that he was in the “planning process.” Sarandos didn’t elaborate on &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the series will return, or what an expanded &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; universe would look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc4ihl"&gt;But if the series gets the full &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; treatment, that could potentially expand to gaming and more. (Netflix has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates"&gt;hammered home&lt;/a&gt; that gaming is core to its business strategy moving forward.) &lt;em&gt;Squid Game &lt;/em&gt;already has its &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.shop/collections/shop-squid-game-merchandise"&gt;own merch line&lt;/a&gt; and Funko Pop collectibles in the Netflix Shop. A new Bape collaboration is slated to drop Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhfX2j"&gt;Bring on the games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Godzilla and the Titans will reunite in new Apple TV Plus Monsterverse series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Godzilla on the international poster for Godzilla vs. Kong." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45pKet-PFR8RYzZi3pDwz3DED9U=/0x290:1773x1472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414303/hLCgtLL.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5a1d"&gt;Though Legendary’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22246258/new-trailers-godzilla-kong-comrades-son-south-hbo-max-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;made waves last summer by debuting on HBO Max and quickly becoming one of the platform’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/godzilla-vs-kong-opening-weekend-analysis-1234943958/"&gt;top performing features&lt;/a&gt;, the next time we see the titanic monster and his fellow kaiju, they’ll be calling new streamer home: Apple Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ucS26"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2022/01/apple-tv-lands-epic-godzilla-and-titans-original-television-series-based-on-legendarys-monsterverse/"&gt;Apple Plus announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has greenlit a new live-action series set in Legendary’s Monsterverse from co-creators Chris Black (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) and Matt Fraction, writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849870/hawkeye-season-1-review-disney-plus"&gt;Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;run that the recent Disney Plus series heavily draws from. Along with Black and Fraction, Toho’s Hiro Matsuoka and Takemasa Arita and Safe House Pictures’ Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell are set to executive produce. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Legendary’s Monsterverse logo." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mT_dA9FrrjwInPKyfHJC3vXl4RM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183187/012022_Apple_Lands_Series_Legendarys_Monsterverse_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Legendary&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Legendary’s Monsterverse logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d6RF7z"&gt;Set after the events of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, the new untitled series is said to feature Godzilla, a number of the Titans, and yet another human family whose interpersonal dramas audiences are &lt;em&gt;meant &lt;/em&gt;to care about even though the literal monsters are what everyone’s really interested in. According to Apple, the new human family at the center of this show will have  deep, mysterious connections to Monarch, the villainous organization responsible for driving Godzilla and Kong to brawl with one another when last we saw them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3eVgs"&gt;Considering how humans have pretty consistently dragged the Monsterverse’s features down in the past, the series is going to have to find a way to legitimately make their plots here feel like more than distractions from the good stuff (read: monster fights). But depending on which monsters show up and how they fight, it might be worth slogging  through a little bit of ground level human humdrum when the show debuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJdsV"&gt;Currently, there’s been no word on when the new Monsterverse series will begin production.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress weighs cleaning up cryptocurrency mining in the US </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-CRYPTOCURRENCY-CLIMATE-EMPLOYMENT-CHINA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LhKT-KlnznCqfUYiAOZrIb0mIY=/0x3:7360x4910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414184/1235927048.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;The “Sandow Switch” that once was used by the Alcoa coal power plant now provides electricity for the Whinstone US Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, on October 9, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by MARK FELIX/AFP /AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vWIVIW"&gt;On Thursday, members of Congress debated how to make cryptocurrencies greener, as energy-intensive bitcoin mining booms in the US. One of the biggest questions was whether to use renewables to power the energy-hungry mining at the heart of bitcoin’s blockchain, or turn to other blockchains that don’t need as much energy in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpU3hW"&gt;The debate took place during an oversight &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg731-3id8"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; on the “energy impacts of cryptocurrency” held by the House Energy &amp;amp; Commerce Committee. The US became the de facto epicenter for bitcoin mining last year, after China clamped down on mining within its borders — in part because of how much energy bitcoin uses. That transition could have big implications for the already strained power grid in the US, as well as the Biden administration’s ability to meet its ambitious climate change goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9aWfXy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Cryptocurrency presence in every day life will likely continue to expand”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="siu2jj"&gt;“Cryptocurrency presence in every day life will likely continue to expand,” Representative Diana Degette (D-CO) said in her opening comments at the hearing. “As the industry moves forward, it’s crucial for cryptocurrency networks to identify ways to reduce the need for constant high volume energy use and minimize effects on the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YolrQk"&gt;The bitcoin network gobbles up more electricity than the countries of Ukraine or Norway use in a year. If bitcoin was a country, that would make it the &lt;a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons"&gt;27th&lt;/a&gt; most electricity-hungry nation in the world. That also makes bitcoin the most polluting cryptocurrency, since bitcoin mining is often powered by fossil fuel energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9iEH"&gt;Part of the reason for bitcoin’s outsized energy use is that it’s the biggest crypto network by far. But bitcoin also needs more electricity than some other cryptocurrencies because it uses a process called “proof of work” that works as a sort of security system to keep its ledger of transactions, the blockchain, secure and accurate. Miners verify transactions by racing to solve complex puzzles using specialized computers. They get bitcoins as a reward. Meanwhile, all that computing power burns through electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Xz5NH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are some worrying signs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkXrFv"&gt;When bitcoin mining was concentrated in China, miners tended to use clean hydropower during the wet season and coal when that resource dried up. In the US, what the energy mix for crypto mining looks like is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702543/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-emissions-china"&gt;still taking shape&lt;/a&gt;. But there are some worrying signs. Miners have already &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/old-coal-plant-is-now-mining-bitcoin-for-a-utility-company/"&gt;extended the lives&lt;/a&gt; of aging power plants that burn coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7LJEr"&gt;“Given our current climate objectives, examples like this are deeply concerning. Our focus now needs to be reducing carbon emissions overall, and increasing the share of green energy on the grid,” Representative Degette said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErJ4oR"&gt;Industry experts who gave testimony during today’s hearing argued that there’s an opportunity for crypto mining to embrace renewable energy and by doing so, help clean energy flourish in the US. A challenge with solar and wind is that they’re intermittent sources of energy — depending on the weather, sometimes there’s not enough and sometimes there’s too much. Miners can use up excess renewable energy that might otherwise go to waste because there’s not enough battery storage yet for renewable energy on the grid, proponents argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwtDQU"&gt;“Computing is a &lt;em&gt;better &lt;/em&gt;battery,” John Belizaire, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Soluna Computing, said during the hearing. His company develops data centers for cryptocurrency mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJdwwc"&gt;Other experts are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; that renewables will be a silver bullet for bitcoin’s energy problems. To cut greenhouse gas emissions, electricity from renewables will eventually need to power everything from vehicles to home heating. So bitcoin mining would be competing with those needs. And when demand for power outpaces supply, it can lead to power outages — or to burning more fossil fuels to supplement clean energy sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fzs8N"&gt;There’s another solution that some experts see. Instead of using proof of work, some cryptocurrencies use different methods to keep their blockchains accurate. The most popular alternative is called proof of stake, which doesn’t require huge amounts of computing power because there are no puzzles to solve. The Ethereum network, the largest after bitcoin, has plans to eventually move from proof of work to proof of stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EP3x9j"&gt;Bitcoin has no such plans. There’s no expectation of the network ever reaching a consensus on making that switch, especially since miners have already invested in the machines they use to crack puzzles. For now, it seems that as long as bitcoin’s the biggest player in the game, cryptocurrencies will continue to eat up more and more energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vakBGB"&gt;“The bitcoin community deserves our deep gratitude for introducing blockchains to the world, but we have far more energy efficient alternatives than proof of stake for the sake of the environment and our energy infrastructure in the United States,” Ari Juels, a professor at Cornell University, and a co-author of a paper that coined the term “proof of work” in 1999 , said in his testimony. “I believe that we need to embrace these newer options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deR2ri"&gt;It’s still not clear how congress members plan to follow up on the hearing; DeGette concluded by saying the discussion of cryptocurrency’s energy usage is going to be “an increasing issue” for the committee. At this point “we don’t have any answers,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfYm7o"&gt;Whatever happens next, the stakes are huge for the planet. The US is the second biggest climate polluter after China. The Biden administration has set a goal of nearly eliminating all greenhouse gas pollution over the next few decades, and that will be difficult to achieve  with or without bitcoin mining playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The IRS will soon make you use facial recognition to access your taxes online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QlpXD63Hu6s20jIktpuzwCjNMHA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414175/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The IRS will use a third party facial recognition company to verify online taxpayers | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssvGhX"&gt;The Internal Revenue Service will require people who access and pay their taxes online to enroll in a third-party facial recognition company starting this summer (h/t &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/"&gt;Krebs on Security&lt;/a&gt;). Even those who have already registered on &lt;a href="http://IRS.gov"&gt;IRS.gov&lt;/a&gt; with a username and password will have to provide a government ID, a copy of a utility bill, and a selfie to ID.me, the Virginia-based identity verification company. You’ll take a video selfie with whatever webcam or mobile device you’re using to sign up, which seems likely to cause problems for people with older hardware or who don’t have access to one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecZqj7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/new-identity-verification-process-to-access-certain-irs-online-tools-and-services"&gt;According to the IRS&lt;/a&gt;, ID.me is a “trusted technology provider” of identity verification services. Anyone who already has an ID.me account from another government agency can sign in with those credentials. Brian Krebs created a new ID.me account and wrote in his post that the sign-up process was time-consuming and glitchy. He got stuck about halfway through the process and had to start again from the beginning, then was prompted to join a video call with an ID.me representative — with a wait time of nearly three and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gzu23w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Most US government agencies are using facial recognition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641216/facial-recognition-gao-report-agency-dhs-cbp-fbi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4EFNKA"&gt;In its “&lt;a href="https://insights.id.me/privacy-bill-of-rights/"&gt;privacy bill of rights&lt;/a&gt;,” ID.me says it doesn’t “sell, lead, or trade biometric data to any third parties or derive any profit from the sale, lease or trade of biometric data.” It can share information with its partners with users’ explicit permission, &lt;a href="https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/202211630-How-does-ID-me-use-my-information-"&gt;according to its website&lt;/a&gt;, and when you register for an ID.me account, you have to accept the company’s biometric consent policy. The company collects facial and voice biometrics to verify identity and protect against fraudulent behavior and to “comply with a request from law enforcement or government entities where not prohibited by law.” And even if you delete your ID.me account, the company may retain your biometric data for several years, depending on “the nature of the data and relevant legal or operational retention needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELem1S"&gt;You may remember ID.me from earlier in the pandemic; more than two dozen states use the company to verify people applying for unemployment benefits. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dbywn/facial-recognition-failures-are-locking-people-out-of-unemployment-systems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported in June 2021&lt;/a&gt; that ID.me failed to identify some applicants and that they had difficulty reaching anyone at the company to remedy their problem. ID.me CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/19/22541427/facial-recognition-software-verify-unemployment-benefits-id-me"&gt;Blake Hall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the time that it uses a system similar to Apple’s FaceID or the way a TSA agent would compare a passenger’s face to their ID at an airport. &lt;/p&gt;
