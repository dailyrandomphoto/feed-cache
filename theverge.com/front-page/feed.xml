    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces try to make it easier to get apps ready for augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CghtZ3dT3JKa7tCMdJUSd8FH9HI=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116410/Snapdragon_Spaces_Lifestyle_Asset.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JsfwNW"&gt;While a lot of talk about the metaverse has focused on virtual reality experiences that use a VR headset to put people in digital environments, other approaches use augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (XR) to blend digital and physical elements. Today at the Augmented World Expo, Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/09/snapdragon-spaces-xr-developer-platform-launches-create-headworn-ar"&gt;is revealing its Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform&lt;/a&gt;, a kit that will help devs expand existing apps and create new ones to take advantage of AR devices you wear on your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpSJR1"&gt;Today’s announcement doesn’t include mention of new hardware, however, Qualcomm is lining up some important partners for the mixed reality future that it’s been planning for the last decade. They include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22768925/niantic-lightship-developer-platform-john-hanke-pokemon-go"&gt;Niantic and its recently revealed Lightship platform&lt;/a&gt; for “real-world metaverse apps,” as well as hardware OEMs including Lenovo, Motorola, Oppo, and Xiaomi. Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 glasses, based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296100/qualcomm-xr1-smart-viewer-ar-glasses-announce-lenovo-thinkreality-a3"&gt;Qualcomm’s XR1 Smart Viewer reference design&lt;/a&gt;, will be the first to “commercialize” Snapdragon Spaces next year. T-Mobile is the “lead 5G launch partner,” and will work with startups and developers via its existing &lt;a href="http://t-mobileaccelerator.com/"&gt;T-Mobile Accelerator program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHzAdeIyVMqJ76T2uTLBw-dJuhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998297/qualcomm_snapdragon_spaces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="krxMUo"&gt;Snapdragon Spaces is intended to underpin an “open” and “cross device” ecosystem, with APIs that are hardware agnostic so the software developers create can run on many different types of platforms, including AR glasses or full AR headsets that look more like Microsoft’s HoloLens. According to Qualcomm, this is “the first headworn AR platform optimized for AR Glasses tethered to smartphones with an OpenXR conformant runtime.” It also has support for the familiar developer tools Unreal Engine 4 and Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0C6LG"&gt;It’s available now to “select” developers like Holo One and NZXT. Access for everyone is coming early next year complete with tools for hand tracking, image recognition and tracking, positional tracking, and the like. Qualcomm also announced it has acquired assets from HINS SAS and its subsidiary, Clay AIR, for hand tracking and gesture recognition, while a partnership with Wikitude will open up access for that AR development platform’s 150,000 registered developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUC4YD"&gt;As 5G becomes widely available on more mobile devices (many of which are powered by Qualcomm hardware) the idea is that AR as a second screen feature for apps will also be ubiquitous. That includes AR tracks overlaying your living room for an Anki Drive-like experience or a floating smartwatch UI that only you can see. There are already augmented reality experiences available for mobile devices that can help you shop for furniture and visualize it inside your living space, but the idea is to make those easier to build, port from platform to platform, and get ready for use in headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5IXa5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s latest keyboard and mouse are cute, colorful, and ready for TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yl99LtD4hQyaka3Q8f2OjgUaAhQ=/0x1:4599x3067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116334/POP_Combo_LIFE_Daydream_1_hand_TOP.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Typewriter-style keycaps plus five emoji-focused keys.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dmk4li"&gt;Logitech has a trio of colorful new peripherals coming to the US this month: a $99.99 Pop Keys keyboard, a $39.99 Pop Mouse, and a $19.99 Desk Mat. In contrast with Logitech’s usual sensibly styled and office-appropriate peripherals, these Studio Series devices are bright and cutesy. They’re each available in three color-coordinate schemes: yellow and black; pink; and purple and yellow options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnvQjX"&gt;If you’ve been eyeing the kinds of colorful, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/computer-accessories/tiktok-colourful-keyboard-mofii-uk-green-b1831236.html"&gt;typewriter-styled keyboards that have flooded TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in recent months but want a model from a well-known household name, then the Pop Keys could be worth a look. You can read my full impressions of the keyboard in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22535735"&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt; or read on for a summary along with my initial impressions of the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0p53o"&gt;Both the keyboard and mouse have a big focus on emoji. The keyboard has five dedicated emoji buttons to its right and there are four extra emoji keycaps in the box. The idea is that you can swap over the keycaps and reprogram each key to correspond to a specific emoji. Meanwhile the mouse has a programmable button underneath its scroll wheel which, by default, opens the emoji selection window. In both cases, these keys and buttons can be reprogrammed and given non-emoji tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuiuCp"&gt;The Pop Keys keyboard is wireless and mechanical. It uses Cherry MX Brown-style switches manufactured by TTC. There’s no USB port to allow it to be used as a wired keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ie6xdyKOdaoUnojAog8rZ0P_BfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998044/High_Resolution_JPG_POP_Keys_Blast_Yellow_FOB_US.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yellow and black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZncoKE9P10jPLWeBLljuKDIhB7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998043/High_Resolution_JPG_POP_Keys_Heartbreaker_Rose_FOB_US.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D2GCNd"&gt;Aside from their colorful exterior, both peripherals have a more typical set of Logitech specs. Battery life extends up to an impressive three years for the keyboard and two years for the mouse, though neither are rechargeable (they use AAA and AA batteries, respectively). They’re capable of pairing to up to three devices using a combination of Bluetooth and Logitech’s Bolt USB receiver (which comes in the box with the keyboard, but not the mouse). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4d6N6V"&gt;Meanwhile, the Desk Mat is 30 x 70cm big, meaning it’s designed to sit under both a keyboard and mouse rather than a traditional mouse mat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m2tp7AyGrqDZYFIHKpkqTAikVZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998046/High_Resolution_JPG_POP_Mouse_Wave_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pop Mouse doesn’t have any thumb buttons, but there’s a shortcut button underneath the scroll wheel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGbyy2C8GEavhT6dsuA0Ur4Zfl0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998047/High_Resolution_JPG_Desk_Mat_Studio_Series_Curl_Lavender.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just in case you need a reminder of what a desk mat looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QBU68Y"&gt;I generally liked the Pop Mouse during my time with it. It’s not going to compete with a high-performance gaming mouse, but its cute design doesn’t get in the way of its functionality. Although I generally prefer having extra thumb buttons on my mice, the extra programmable button under its scroll wheel is an acceptable compromise. Its left and right mouse clicks are also much quieter than average, which might be useful in quiet libraries or shared dorms. Finally, it’s also compatible with Logitech’s Flow software, which is designed to let one keyboard and mouse control multiple computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaDFRX"&gt;The three accessories launched in countries including China and Australia earlier this year and will release in the US later this month. Logitech says they’ll be coming to Europe in the near future with a price that’s yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite holiday gifts under $50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zThM19eW8UeFtTLtf7bAahfqzDM=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116332/Budget_50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Richard Parry&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts don’t always require you to splurge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="grzXMI"&gt;Even though many of us are better off in some ways than we were in 2020, we’re still in the midst of a pandemic. And for a good number of people, that means this holiday season will, like last year, be about celebrating on a budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xuioi"&gt;Thankfully, there are plenty of great gifts you can purchase if you have a little spending cash in your wallet. Our budget-conscious gift guide features a variety of ideas that cost under $50, all of which are either thoughtful, entertaining, or incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPq2aB"&gt;Below, you’ll find personalized art prints illustrating what the Solar System looked like the day your loved one was born — or the minute you met your partner. Other recs, like Rocketbook’s reusable smart notebook, can help a friend or family member declutter their life and remain environmentally conscious while doing so. We even have a few home tech and literary staples on the list, as well as a Bluetooth tracker that allows Apple users to keep better tabs on their belongings. Holiday travel is still a thing, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s cutesy Pop Keys keyboard is annoyingly form over function</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For the aesthetic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Ayty1o"&gt;Logitech’s $99.99 Pop Keys is part of Logitech’s new Studio Series lineup of cute computer accessories alongside the $39.99 Pop Mouse and $19.99 Logitech Desk Mat. The keyboard appears to be an attempt to pair Logitech’s typically solid functionality, like multiyear battery life and easy cross-device compatibility, with a cutesy &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/computer-accessories/tiktok-colourful-keyboard-mofii-uk-green-b1831236.html"&gt;TikTok-friendly aesthetic&lt;/a&gt; and novelties like keys dedicated to typing emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZbkma"&gt;But after using the keyboard for daily work, I don’t think Logitech has gotten the balance right. The Pop Keys’ typewriter-style keycaps might look great on social media, but they’re tricky and unforgiving to type on, and replacing useful key functions with five emoji shortcuts is a novelty that gets old quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbPHDr"&gt;The Pop Keys is hitting the US this month, and Logitech tells me it’ll be available in Europe in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XyhyjI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10854277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oaFNCn"&gt;There’s little wrong with the basic specs of the Pop Keys. Although it’s not rechargeable, you get three years of battery life from an included pair of AAA batteries. It’s capable of pairing to up to three devices via Bluetooth or up to two Bluetooth devices plus one via Logitech’s Bolt USB receiver (included in the box), and you can easily switch between them using the F1 to F3 keys. The keyboard is available in three color schemes: pink; yellow and black; or purple and yellow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNgPNA"&gt;The Pop Keys has what’s generally known as a 75 percent keyboard layout, which means it’s more compact than a full-size keyboard but still includes a function row and arrow keys. Although you can change this in Logitech’s settings, by default this function row is given over to a variety of other commands like switching between paired devices and playback and volume controls. There’s an Fn key to access the more standard F1 - F12 buttons. On the right of the keyboard there are five programmable keys designed for typing different emoji symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRov7wa3pDCmoO0AxAcuq7opvW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988783/jporter_211105_4863_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four keys for typing emoji, one to open up the emoji selection menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TjKFsl"&gt;It’s clear what Logitech’s priorities are with the Pop Keys from the moment you open its box. Rather than including both Windows and Mac keycaps in the box like other manufacturers such as Keychron have started doing, Logitech has opted to include keys with additional emoji symbols on them. The idea is that when you program the keyboard’s emoji shortcut buttons, they correspond to the right symbols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRbCmY"&gt;So while the Pop Keys still technically supports both Mac and Windows, the Option / Windows and Command / Alt legends are crammed onto the same keys. It’s functionally fine, but it looks messy. Especially on a keyboard that prioritizes its appearance as much as the Pop Keys does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eh0nMi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mac and Windows legends are crammed onto the same keys&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JtXJQ2"&gt;Instead, the idea with the eight available emoji keycaps is to pick your four favorite emoji for the keyboard, and then use Logitech’s software to program the keys to correspond to the emoji you’ve picked. There’s a fifth emoji key on the keyboard that acts as a shortcut to pull up the OS-level emoji selection menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBbRkM"&gt;I can see the basic appeal, but the whole implementation is so cumbersome that I ended up just getting annoyed that the Pop Keys wasted five precious keys on emoji when it could have more useful buttons there like dedicated Home / End keys or Print Screen. For starters, four out of the five emoji keys don’t even do anything until you’ve installed and configured Logitech’s Options software and told it what emoji you want each of them to correspond to (the button to open the OS-level emoji select menu doesn’t require the software).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Ch4XC_fP-q8R2crpRgClnk_AqM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988786/jporter_211105_4863_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tactile brown switch sits under each key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D1wit8"&gt;Even then, four emoji keys sit in a weird middle ground between “people who love emoji enough that they want dedicated emoji buttons on their keyboard” and “people who only use four emoji on a regular basis.” I’m perfectly happy to admit I might not be the target market for this keyboard, but personally I’d much rather have dedicated Home and End keys rather than having to access these common functions by using Fn and the left and right arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kbb5xD"&gt;It’s possible to remap these keys to something more useful using Logitech’s software if you’re not an emoji fiend, and there’s the option of remapping them to individual keys or key combinations. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to assign one of them to be a print screen key (on Windows, Logitech tells me that the keyboard’s F5 key is set to launch the Snip &amp;amp; Sketch tool by default, but I’d prefer the speed and flexibility of a dedicated Print Screen button). Key remaps also aren’t saved to the keyboard, so you’ll have to remap it if you ever want to connect it to an alternative PC. And naturally the keycaps aren’t going to match the function they’re performing if it’s not an emoji (buying third-party keycaps could be an option, but watch out for the non-standard bottom row).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DSp7bDqNGFoB8UKe1qCxWyGv9fI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988785/jporter_211105_4863_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;F1 to F3 offer shortcuts to switch between three paired devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2Q3A13"&gt;Even if you went to the trouble of remapping each of these emoji keys to fulfill more useful functions, you’re still left with a keyboard with typewriter-style keys that can be a chore to type on. There’s nothing wrong with the switches underneath each key (they’re tactile Cherry MX Brown clones produced by TTC). But the keyboard’s circular keycaps are unforgiving. If your finger doesn’t hit a key directly, then there are big gaps between the keys for it to fall into. I could get by, but squared off keycaps are the standard for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DBJtJV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Its keycaps are made of ABS plastic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXIw54"&gt;Beyond their circular shape, the Pop Keys’ keycaps just don’t seem particularly well made. Their legends are pad printed, which is a method generally criticized for wearing away after just a couple of years (dye sublimation or double-shot molding is generally preferred). When I asked Logitech about this, it told me the keys are coated with a UV resistant finish that should allow the legends to stay crisp “over many years.” The keycaps are also made of ABS plastic, which can wear down and become shiny over time (which is why PBT plastic is often considered the better option). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o772BL"&gt;A couple of additional observations: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cZS17O"&gt;There are no height-adjustable feet on the Pop Keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8VShuN"&gt;You’ll find a small holder for the included Bolt receiver inside the battery compartment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n0HXu5"&gt;The keyboard isn’t backlit, but you get a small LED on the Caps Lock key to show when it’s activated.           &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s3GeQH"&gt;There’s a bit of rattle to the space bar’s stabilizers, if that’s the kind of thing that bothers you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzXr-VIhsOr5pFt1vkwDqTXVD64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988784/jporter_211105_4863_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keycaps are pad-printed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jkSe4b"&gt;Logitech’s Pop Keys is a great-looking little keyboard, and three years of battery life is nothing to be sniffed at. But it’s not functional enough for me to recommend it to most people. The circular keycaps take some getting used to, and even then I think regular square keycaps are just plain better for typing. Emoji keys are a nice idea, but I don’t think they’re a practical addition that many people will get much use out of, and it’s a missed opportunity not to include some more useful keys. And my experiences with past keyboards suggest the Pop Keys’ legends could be prone to wear away over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m90LXu"&gt;If you’re in love with Logitech’s aesthetic and use emoji enough that you’re happy to dedicate multiple keys on your keyboard to them, then the Pop Keys technically does everything it claims. But if you’re prepared to compromise on aesthetics, then I’d recommend checking out &lt;a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/normal-profile-keyboards/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"&gt;Keychron’s K2 wireless keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. It might not look as cute, but it’s a whole lot more functional.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense’s U7G TV brings a speedy 120Hz refresh rate for a low price at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hisense U7G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YtzI9JsSThepLg3gQDhu4c0QpCE=/0x0:1679x1119/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116295/hisenseu7ghero.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kpwkWo"&gt;Expect to see plenty of great deals on 4K TVs as we get ever closer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the month. But one of those must-see deals is happening today at Best Buy. The latest version of Hisense’s 55-inch &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfXACaGjz8O" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;U7G Series TV&lt;/a&gt; normally costs $850, but the retailer is selling it for $650 while also throwing in three months free of Apple TV Plus. The TV comes equipped with a 120Hz panel with support for Dolby Vision, HDR 10, and HDR10 Plus. Google Assistant is available right out of the box, as are major streaming apps, including YouTube, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PCBs0"&gt;For the money, it seems tough to find a TV that’s better equipped to provide fast refresh rates for PS5 and Xbox Series X games than the U7G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3bMTX"&gt;Note this model also is included in Hisense’s “&lt;a href="https://www.hisense-promos.com/tryit/en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 Day No Regrets Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;,” which means you’ll get a refund if you don’t like the TV after trying it out for 100 days. However, you must make sure to register the device with Hisense within 14 days of purchase to be eligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LkEB3I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853361"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GzDDhk"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max headphones are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, but the best doesn’t usually come cheap. They originally sold for $549. Today, however, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZD76NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick up a pair for well over $100 off that price&lt;/a&gt; — a record low. Amazon is selling the headphones in several styles for $429.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3Z6rJ"&gt;Of course, there are other far cheaper and similarly high-quality headphones out there that you can still get for about half the price. One example is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; that are selling for $240 instead of $400 as part of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday sale&lt;/a&gt;. However, the AirPods Max might tempt you if you have several Apple products, as it can seamlessly pair with them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6J5hm2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SincT6"&gt;If you’re looking for affordable wireless earbuds instead of the sometimes-pricier over-ear headphones, you can save about $130 when you buy a refurbished pair of Jabra Elite 85t. The earbuds are discounted at several retailers to $150, but right now you can buy them refurbished for just $100 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F164914311936%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals110921%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F9%2F22770263%2Fapple-airpods-google-pixelbook-hisense-tv-macbook-air-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; through Jabra’s digital storefront. Jabra says that these might have minor blemishes but have still been inspected and cleaned by its team. All original accessories are included, and they have a two-year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGSFJg"&gt;Launched last year, these Jabra earbuds feature active noise cancellation and a semi-open design for better comfort. They can simultaneously pair with two devices, as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7cjrUB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="csvPmN"&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s elegantly designed Pixelbook Go stood out because of its good battery life and excellent keyboard. The main drawback, however, was its price. It normally starts at $849, which is much more expensive than other well-made Chromebooks. But if you really want Google’s own model, it’s selling at an all-time low price right now on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YMM4YC1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Equipped with an 8th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, the Chromebook is selling for $749 instead of $849, saving you $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dLJhPL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ggWor0"&gt;The 2020 Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Air is $100 off at Amazon. The base configuration, equipped with a 256GB SSD, 8GB of RAM, and an Apple M1 chip, normally sells for $999 but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5KWB9H?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the silver version for $899&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y6Px3"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn called the entry-level MacBook the most impressive laptop he’d used in years. It’s fast, he said, with incredible performance, excellent battery life, and a good keyboard. It’s possible that we may see this price drop even further soon, especially as we approach Black Friday. However, this certainly isn’t a bad deal if you need a laptop right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qNIz8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNSJkE"&gt;For those trying to get fit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22386394/fitbit-luxe-fitness-wellness-tracker-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s Luxe&lt;/a&gt; tracker is now available at its lowest price on Amazon. Typically $150, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZF7QDXJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $100 in various colors. The product comes with a complimentary six-month trial of Fitbit Premium, Fitbit’s fitness subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHQoNJ"&gt;The stylish Fitbit Luxe is a good buy for those who want their fitness tracker to look more like jewelry. It boasts a colorful OLED touchscreen display and, like other Fitbit models, the Luxe tracks a variety of metrics including heart rate, sleep, exercise, and more. While it only comes in one size, there are both small and large sized-bands included with every Luxe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v7q0id"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10853102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6kYcnb"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other notable deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZvEJNa"&gt;Amazon is selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MS5B7NS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alita: Battle Angel&lt;/em&gt; in UHD Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt; at its lowest price yet when you click on the on-page coupon. Normally $20, you can buy it instead for $9.33. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207027/alita-battle-angel-review-rosa-salazar-robert-rodriguez-christoph-waltz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IAakDi"&gt;Pick up the complete series of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the Netflix reboot. &lt;a href="https://tv.apple.com/show/cowboy-bebop/umc.cmc.p83rtqx9v5ptlevdexc1v6b4?itsct=tv_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=VergeDeals110921"&gt;The whole series is in 4K digital from Apple’s iTunes for just $5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PPfkav"&gt;You can still take part in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A2NEKY0JEA1965" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s buy two, get one free promotion&lt;/a&gt; that loops in books, movies, and video games. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Massive Comcast Xfinity outage disconnects TV and internet across the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comcast’s Xfinity Mobile Service Introduces New 5G Unlimited Data Options" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4k4rU5jGGHxRaHByu_zxoR8BAE=/0x0:6036x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116289/1232480552.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jeff Fusco/Getty Images for Comcast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p6KDbb"&gt;This morning many Comcast Xfinity subscribers woke up without their usual services. Reports indicate the system is down, or at least unsteady, in areas stretching from Chicago to Philadelphia, New Jersey, and South Carolina. Looking at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/xfinity/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt;, issues had been reported earlier in the Bay Area, but it’s unclear if those are connected to the problems people are having right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSuUCQ"&gt;A message on the company’s outage status page (if you can reach it, which many people apparently can’t) notes there is an issue and currently says it will be resolved at 10:49AM ET, without revealing why there’s such a specific timeline. There are also reports that most can’t get through to phone support either. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Comcast for a comment on the problem and will update this article once more information is available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5m35Z"&gt;Some people, like me, have been able to get online this morning without an issue while using Comcast’s cable internet, but the number of reports from home and business customers alike shows the issue is widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDnCph"&gt;There are reports of services coming back online, and some people have had success simply resetting their modems, but so far we haven’t been able to confirm what steps will help you reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtfXmb"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4dScZS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you for reaching out! I do apologize you are experiencing a service interruption in your area. We are currently having connection concerns around the nation, our network team is working hard toward a resolution. Thank you for your patience! -MR&lt;/p&gt;— Xfinity Support (@XfinitySupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XfinitySupport/status/1458082493706481668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>You.com wants to remake the search engine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A You.com search page showing results for “Billie Eilish”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82wMCTjnN4Ffktr7gqFx7OvQHPA=/0x290:3106x2361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116184/Billie_Eilish.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="je6ArS"&gt;Google Search organizes the way billions of people think about facts and data, and for years, it’s been organized around &lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-one-true-answer-problem-featured-snippets-270549"&gt;a principle dubbed “one true answer”&lt;/a&gt;: the idea that most people are looking for something best answered by a succinct factual snippet. But that’s not the only way people might navigate the web, and today, a company called You.com is trying something different: a search engine built around sorting and comparing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5P1qh1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://you.com/?safe_search=Moderate"&gt;You.com&lt;/a&gt;, founded by two former Salesforce employees, is opening today in public beta and announcing a $20 million funding round led by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. The service abandons the linear list of links you’ll find in most general-purpose search engines, opting for a grid of answers organized by source. The sources include generic categories like “web results” and “news” but also specific sites like StackOverflow, Wikipedia, Twitter, Amazon, LinkedIn, and individual news sites like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A You.com search for “Section 230” offering a grid of search results" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m86GIXFJQOIkwezYDPFlVyckbPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998185/Screen_Shot_2021_11_09_at_6.46.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kTdY4N"&gt;On top of this organizational change, You.com’s big differentiating feature is that it lets people influence which sources they see. You can “upvote” and “downvote” specific categories, so when you run searches, you’ll see preferred sources first, neutral searches next, and downvoted sources last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9uVHed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The You.com grid encourages comparing sources instead of clicking the first link&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5w2q8E"&gt;When I searched for “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt;” on You.com’s pre-launch beta, for instance, it defaulted to showing a box of general “web results” first, including links to Cornell University and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. But I could also opt to see something like a Wikipedia snippet or a series of Reddit results first. The categories are also influenced by the context of your search. If I searched “Moonfall” it would favor an IMDb-powered “What to Watch” box for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654021/moonfall-trailer-date-halle-berry-roland-emmerich"&gt;upcoming Roland Emmerich film&lt;/a&gt;, while looking up “infrastructure bill” prioritized a general news grid and media coverage from many different outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWhiH5"&gt;Some of these searches — like the Section 230 one — ultimately surface pretty similar results to Google. But the interface encourages looking across a range of sources rather than clicking the first one or two links. It also includes interesting tools for specific use cases. Searching “for loop javascript,” for instance, will summon lists of reference pages on Google, but You.com will surface actual plaintext snippets of syntax from sources like W3Schools that you can easily copy and paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="o8I8VD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The engine can’t guess what you’re thinking as well as Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IR1JTR"&gt;You.com isn’t optimized for answering basic questions the way Google is, especially for queries that require guessing what people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; instead of what they literally type. It’s a lot more willing to encourage clicking through to other pages — if you want the “actor who plays Sherlock Holmes,” You.com will deliver links to lists while Google will give you a grid of movie stars. It doesn’t include little features like offering answers in the search bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gkJTr"&gt;And You.com is generally worse at guiding your eye to the most relevant information. If you’re not used to closely reading the text of search results, it looks overwhelming and sort of cluttered. I only used a desktop version of the prelaunch beta, which feels like the way it’s &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be experienced but isn’t necessarily where most people want to search the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqdjME"&gt;But the service seems far more honest about its own limitations than Google. Google’s text snippets are arguably the platform’s worst feature, granting a &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1192/google-s-featured-snippets-are-worse-than-fake-news"&gt;false sense of authoritativeness&lt;/a&gt; to inaccurate or offensive information or even summarizing an accurate answer in a &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/emilymbender/status/1449539234210062340"&gt;dangerously wrong way&lt;/a&gt;. (Full disclosure: I could only find that last link through Google, where I got it by hunting down “google seizure snippet,” while You.com offered general information about snippets and seizures.) You.com does offer a “Quick Facts” box for queries like “distance from the Earth to the Moon,” but it’s delivered alongside a bunch of other results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRO18H"&gt;You.com comes tantalizingly close to being an engine for web search power users who like comparing multiple sources of information. It’s still missing key features like searching within a limited date range, something co-founder and CEO Richard Socher says is coming later, and it’s not as all-purpose as Google. (Clicking the closed beta’s Maps icon actually just directs you to Google Maps.) But that’s part of the appeal — Socher reasonably describes You.com as “unbundling” search from a Google-style web empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I6lnax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You.com avoids feeling like a more principled, less useful Google clone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ireXUb"&gt;Weirdly, the company doesn’t make this pitch very well in its launch announcement. It describes its system as “summarizing results from across the web,” which feels almost precisely backward. Socher says the phrase refers to You.com’s grouping of results by source, but compared to Google, it features practically no explicit editorial summarizing of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIKT49"&gt;Like DuckDuckGo, Brave Search, and other services trying to chip away at Google’s overwhelming dominance in search, You.com emphasizes the idea that it’s more private and less heavily tracked. It’s not supported by ads and linked with countless tie-in products the way Google is, and there’s an incognito mode that You.com says hides your IP address. Among other things, it promises that it will never target personalized ads at users. The service, unfortunately, doesn’t have a business model at all yet, however, so it’s not clear what kind of other tradeoffs it might have to make in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjHyL"&gt;You.com probably won’t appeal to everyone, but it’s offering an interesting and fairly unique feature set. It’s one of the rare non-subject-specific search engines that avoids feeling like a more principled but practically inferior version of Google — encouraging thinking about the web as an actual network of websites, not just grist for an answer box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton takes on strength training with its $495 Guide camera system, coming in 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lfuzx6iu-3Ami-x55ch5yOaWQ28=/120x0:1080x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116113/Tiger_Announcement_Press_Image_11042021___01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hyfsUV"&gt;Peloton is moving into strength training with its latest product, &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/guide-announce"&gt;the Peloton Guide&lt;/a&gt;, a TV-connected camera that can display workouts and track your movements in real time to help make sure you’re doing things properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r028ed"&gt;Peloton Guide is also the company’s cheapest product yet, set to cost $495 at launch in “early 2022” for a bundle that includes the Guide camera, the company’s newly updated Peloton Heart Rate Band, and a remote. You’ll have to provide other workout equipment like weights or resistance bands on your own, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnWJt2"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409958503444"&gt;Guide owners&lt;/a&gt; will need a $12.99 per month membership (the same price that Peloton charges for its app-only subscription) to use the service, although if you already own a Tread or Bike and pay for the $39-per-month All-Access Membership, you won’t have to pay more to use a Guide. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2cFwaVJGmjaciPCDukMSiCvz4QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998217/Fullwidth_Media_02_Desktop.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6aL98u"&gt;Technically, Peloton has already offered strength training classes for a while now (the rotating screen on the Peloton Bike Plus is even designed to help facilitate them). But the Guide aims to provide a more comprehensive experience by offering what the company calls “Self Mode,” which uses the Guide’s built-in camera to track your movements and show your workout on the screen alongside the instructors to make sure you’re doing exercises properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRvKWS"&gt;That said, with the cost of membership the same between using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21202979/peloton-android-tv-app-launch-social-distancing"&gt;the free app on an existing set-top box&lt;/a&gt; and buying Peloton’s $495 bespoke hardware, Peloton’s tracking will have to be very impressive to justify the added cost here. It’s about on par with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758939/tempo-move-iphone-smart-home-gym-workout-tracker-live-classes"&gt;competitors like the Tempo Move&lt;/a&gt; ($495 at launch), although that bundle simply uses an iPhone for a camera and does include weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AC3RRk"&gt;In addition to the camera for tracking movement, the Guide also features a built-in microphone, allowing you to play, pause, rewind, or fast forward through a class without having to put down your weights or stop whatever exercise you’re doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX5Wfb"&gt;Of course, with any smart device that features a microphone and a camera that lives in your living room, there are the obvious questions of privacy. Peloton promises that customers will be able to fully control the device with an integrated camera cover for when you’re not using it and a physical switch to disable the microphone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFvQpKHdWYmvNBTp-QS6FalIpZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22998218/Tiger_Announcement_Press_Image_11042021___02.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KxYnSe"&gt;To start, the Guide will only offer strength-focused classes (both bodyweight only and with added weights), although Peloton says that it plans to add support for more types of workouts over time. The company’s announcement also conspicuously doesn’t have any information about whether the Guide will offer live classes for strength workouts like those Peloton offers for its Tread and Bike products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofQJAc"&gt;In addition to the Guide, Peloton is also debuting a new heart rate monitor (which will be included with all Guide purchases). The updated monitor is an armband, instead of a chest strap, and features integrated LEDs to allow you to more easily check your heart rate with a quick glance. The new strap will be sold separately for $89 in “early 2022,” a $40 increase over the company’s soon to be discontinued $49 chest strap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIk5tx"&gt;The Peloton Guide is set to launch in the US and Canada in early 2022, and in the UK, Australia, and Germany “in 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit is rolling out an ECG app to the Charge 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DuTjMoDXckniFUj-CqknrSlu3gY=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116011/jpeters_210914_4757_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWtsu6"&gt;Fitbit released its Charge 5 fitness tracker with a brand new design and a color screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697200/fitbit-charge-5-fitness-tracker-price-available"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but it launched without two key software features: an electrocardiogram (ECG) app and Fitbit’s new Daily Readiness Score, which recommends how hard you should work out. More than a month after the Charge 5’s release, those features are now rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seu2XI"&gt;The ECG app takes a reading of your heart’s rhythm to assess for atrial fibrillation. To take the reading, open the app, put your fingers on the stainless steel panels on each side of the Charge 5, and wait for 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xW8fBpxLnx8aBIQklwqzcmI4ALY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859125/Fitbit_Charge_5_Still_Deep_Sea_Sport.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fitbit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each side of the Charge 5 has a stainless steel panel where you place your fingers during an ECG test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="48aDwq"&gt;ECG apps are showing up in more wearables, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152346/fitbit-sense-electrocardiogram-ecg-reading-hardware-issue-replacement"&gt;Fitbit’s own Sense smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; and the Apple Watch, but you shouldn’t take readings from the apps as a definitive diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Research has shown that the Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702151/apple-watch-heartbeat-irregular-pulse-afib"&gt;can flag multiple types of irregular heartbeats&lt;/a&gt;, for example, so if you have any concerns about your heart health, consult a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9D5he"&gt;The new Daily Readiness Score uses data tracked by your Fitbit to recommend a level of intensity for your workout that day. Your Fitbit device assesses your activity, heart rate variability, and sleep to calculate the score. A higher score means Fitbit thinks you can take on a more intense level of activity, while a lower score means you should prioritize a lower-intensity workout to help with recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2AjDRt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rWc7gxgu6Y?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSH0uO"&gt;The Daily Readiness Score is a Fitbit Premium-exclusive feature, so if you want to use it, you’ll have to be a member of the $9.99-per-month (or $79.99-per-year) subscription service. It’s supported by more Fitbit devices than just the Charge 5, though; it’s also available on the Fitbit Sense, Versa 3, Versa 2, Luxe, or Inspire 2 starting Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This $252 Nokia X100 is a budget 5G phone with a 1080p display and 6GB RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iuo3ZS4_YPvZib4d0za9eKlQdNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116059/nokia_x100_product_photo__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X100 is a T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile exclusive budge 5G phone.&lt;/em&gt; | HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6K8CXr"&gt;Starting November 19th, 2021, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile will be adding another budget 5G phone to the lineup — the $252 Nokia X100 that is exclusive to T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLQUYX"&gt;This addition is coming just as the holiday shopping season is ready for kickoff, and T-Mobile’s sales of other budget 5G phones from REVVL and certain OnePlus models have been limited by handset shortages, according to Wave7 Research’s September 2021 Smartphone Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIZwuq"&gt;Nokia is doing its part to jump-start sales by packing the X100 with lots of surprising features, despite its small sub-$300 price tag. While it shares similar looks and the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22760873/nokia-g50-review-mobile-5g-sub6hz-android-smartphone"&gt;$300 Nokia G50&lt;/a&gt;, that’s where their similarities end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDd0HT"&gt;Unlike the G50, the X100 is geared for entertainment. It has a 6.67-inch 1080p full HD display (1080 x 2400p resolution), with a 20:9 aspect ratio that is a little wider to better fit full-screen videos. It has 6GB of RAM to support its processor, 128GB of internal storage, as well as a microSD card slot that can accept up to a 1TB card for backup and extra storage. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a4069TCDv9dDJEAbUwGVTcz_6Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996850/Nokia_X100_Lifestyle_Photo__6_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia X100 has quad rear cameras, including a 2-megapixel Macro camera for closeups and extreme details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8PTBp"&gt;The cheaper Nokia X100 also has four cameras on the back: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide camera, a 2-megapixel depth camera, as well as a 2-megapixel Macro camera for extreme closeups and details. It also has a 16-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda8v6"&gt;Out of the box, the X100 uses Android 11, but it’s unclear if and when this model will get future OS or security updates from the carrier or manufacturer. It’s worth noting this Nokia doesn’t have the biggest battery at 4,470mAh, especially in combination with its high-resolution screen and 5G connectivity. However, it still has a 3.5mm audio jack for wired headphone fans, as well as NFC to handle contactless payments. As a 5G phone, the X100 is compatible with T-Mobile’s slower but more widely available sub-6Hz 5G network, in case you need 5G speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhd4QQ"&gt;You can find the Nokia X100 at T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile stores starting on November 19th for $252. Keep your eyes peeled for extra carrier holiday deals to sweeten the Nokia X100 even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpHTAE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwywxv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
