    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QWrpNV"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"&gt;a devastating and deeply embarrassing cyberattack&lt;/a&gt; on one of the United States’ largest oil pipelines, one that forced many gas stations to shut down and reportedly caused average national gas prices to &lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/78-of-gas-stations-without-fuel-in-region-gas-prices-rise-above-3-nationally"&gt;rise above $3 for the first time since 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the oil is flowing again. But &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Colonial Pipeline had to pay a nearly $5 million ransom to get there, and it paid that ransom within mere hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qIOkB"&gt;That’s striking, because it’s the opposite of what &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/colonial-pipeline-has-no-plan-pay-ransom-hackers-sources-2021-05-12/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and others reported in the wake of the attack. “Sources familiar with the company’s response,” a phrase often used when a company doesn’t want to be named, suggested the company had no plans to pay hackers. CNN’s sources insisted Colonial Pipeline had not yet paid the ransom, and would probably not &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;to pay, suggesting it had already “managed to retrieve the most important data that was stolen” with help from the US government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44pPXX"&gt;It’s also a little worrying because of how a successful ransom might encourage hackers in future. Over the years, we’ve heard reports of smaller companies and local government entities paying ransoms to regain access to their computers, but this is perhaps one of the most high-profile examples of ransomware yet, and the news might inspire copycats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfyjIM"&gt;On the plus side, a digital forensics expert who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggested that $5 million isn’t a particularly large sum of money for something like this: “Ransom is usually around $25 million to $35 million for such a company. I think the threat actor realized they stepped on the wrong company and triggered a massive government response,” LIFARS CEO Ondrej Krehel told the publication. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline hackers apologized for the “social consequences”&lt;/a&gt; and promised to ransom less controversial targets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TandVF"&gt;It’s not clear which parts of the Colonial Pipeline were at risk: a spokesperson suggested there was no evidence the company’s operational systems were compromised; CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had three sources yesterday say that the pipeline shut down because its billing system was affected, and the company wasn’t sure it’d be able to charge properly for fuel. &lt;a href="https://zetter.substack.com/p/ransomware-infection-on-colonial"&gt;Reporting by cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter&lt;/a&gt; suggests the decision was likely more complicated than that, as other entities in the oil distribution system were also worried the ransomware could spread to their computers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HOLaz"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;President Biden signed an executive order aimed at improving national cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;, with the White House specifically naming the Colonial Pipeline, the SolarWinds hack, and the Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities as the kinds of infrastructure failures the government hopes to address.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW8iLmOH2HqYJ6T5xWQTPBEdWrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512044/colonial_pipeline_restart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eb28XF"&gt;The Colonial Pipeline &lt;a href="https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption"&gt;began resuming operations on Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;, with President Biden saying it should be “reaching full operational capacity as we speak” in a briefing early Thursday afternoon. Oil supplies should be “seeing a region-by-region return to normalcy beginning this weekend,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mw2ZMw"&gt;Still, he warns, “this is not like flicking on a light switch — this pipeline is 500,000 miles long, it had never been shut down in its history... it’s going to take some time, and there may be some hiccups along the way here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIbIDo"&gt;Biden says the US isn’t blaming Russia directly: “We do not believe the Russian government was involved in this attack, but we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOEDHL"&gt;He also announced a specific measure against ransomware: “Our Justice Department has launched a new task force dedicated to prosecuting ransomware hackers to the full extent of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PS2O8"&gt;President Biden declined to comment on whether Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPY3QS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A podcast app is exposing subscribers-only shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HeubL6mLdU4_TFdLspnUu8PqSwY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69281526/VRG_ILLO_4584_Castbox.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The beauty and misery of private RSS feeds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XSQEuV"&gt;There’s only supposed to be one way to hear exclusive podcast content from sports host Scott Wetzel: by paying $5 a month to subscribe to his Patreon. But the show’s also been available on a smaller podcasting app for free. In fact, leaked podcast feeds from dozens of subscription-only shows, including Wetzel’s and &lt;em&gt;The Last Podcast On The Left&lt;/em&gt;, are available to stream through Castbox, a smaller app for both iOS and Android, just by searching for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqXOUl"&gt;Two people in the podcast space tell me they’ve reached out to Castbox multiple times, only for the company to remove a show and then have it pop up again, an infuriating cycle for someone trying to charge for their content. “It’s a little bit like playing whack-a-mole with them,” says one source, who asked to remain anonymous because of their ongoing work in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpN9ym"&gt;Podcast subscriptions have existed for years, but they’ve gained wider attention this past month. Apple, which makes the dominant podcasting app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; in-app subscriptions with a button that lets people directly subscribe to a show from the app. Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its own subscription product, too, but with caveats — the main one being there’s no actual in-app button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mRk9QZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multiple private RSS feeds are publicly available through Castbox&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BohG0I"&gt;Prior to both of these proprietary solutions, the podcasting world’s subscription products mostly centered on private RSS feeds, or links typically assigned to individual listeners that allow them to access shows. The links can be pasted into any supporting podcast app, like Apple Podcasts, Overcast, and Pocket Casts, and for the most part, the system’s worked. Podcasting remains a mostly open ecosystem, and although this content is paywalled, shows still benefit from seamless RSS distribution. Notably, podcasters don’t have to manage multiple backends across services and can publish all their subscribers’ content at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsXSc4"&gt;But private feeds still have a glaring downside: these links can be easily shared, and anyone with the link can access private content. Piracy might become a growing concern, too, as the industry looks toward subscription and exclusive models. Already we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436713/anchor-copycat-podcasts-mike-mignano-spotify-upload"&gt;pirated shows on Anchor&lt;/a&gt;, and re-uploads of the Spotify-exclusive &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; on Castbox, as well. Although Castbox is small enough that the leaks likely aren’t on most podcasters’ radars, they still illustrate the problems one weak link in the distribution chain can create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBFbTT"&gt;“This is the beauty and the mess of the open system — the web is amazing and allows us to publish content everywhere, but restricting access to content is always going to be tricky,” says Justin Jackson, co-founder of podcast hosting service Transistor.fm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwSDmO"&gt;He adds that, inevitably, people will find ways to subvert the system, whether that’s recording audio and distributing it on their own or sharing their private feed links among friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSFvOS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Much of the podcast subscription industry is built around private RSS feeds, but a link can be shared&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aOstzF"&gt;To prevent situations like this, software has been touted as a possible solution. Slate’s Supporting Cast — which powers multiple membership-oriented shows, including Slate’s own Slate Plus network — monitors private RSS feeds for suspicious activity, like thousands of downloads on what’s supposed to be someone’s single-person feed. The software also monitors the IP addresses where someone is listening and the podcast app they’re using to see if anything seems out of the ordinary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mVfmW"&gt;So far, the issue hasn’t become a huge problem. Supporting Cast CEO David Stern says the team has only had to take action fewer than 100 times in the year and a half that the automated monitoring has been active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nirVRY"&gt;“You could always share a username and password to Hulu or Netflix, and that’s sort of okay. The companies let you get away with that,” Stern says. “You’ve got to strike a balance. We’re not talking about national security secrets here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyvHdv"&gt;The software-side workarounds can be effective — especially considering RSS, the backbone upon which the podcast industry was built, doesn’t allow for many technical improvements. However, it’s an investment that not every company might want to make. So the broader solution for locking down private feeds is simpler: tags, or literal snippets of text, that are part of a podcast feed’s metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RXxMKo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When software solutions fail, tags should help&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgTRq7"&gt;Multiple distribution companies and hosting platforms now &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/podcast-publishers/answer/9747492?hl=en"&gt;verify the owners of RSS feeds&lt;/a&gt; through tags. These tags list an owner’s email address, which the platforms then use to verify the person uploading the feed, thereby preventing people from trying to pass an already established show off as their own. Feeds can also be “locked,” a separate tag that, if respected, stops platforms from importing a show. A third and final tag, which is particularly relevant to private RSS feeds, instructs podcast apps not to index a particular show. Google Podcasts, as an example, scours the web to index shows and include them in the app, similarly to how its search engine populates results. If this tag is placed in an RSS feed, as it likely would be for a private feed, the app won’t index it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMPCKe"&gt;“What most platforms are doing is making it as difficult as they can for people to pirate podcast feeds – for people to submit podcast feeds to the directories — but still, at the same time, trying to make it easy for folks [who listen],” Jackson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTQxiE"&gt;The catch with tags, though, is they’re only as good as the platforms allow them to be. You might tell a platform not to index a program, but it doesn’t have to obey that request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BZDJo"&gt;Jackson posits that this appears to be happening in Castbox’s case. These RSS feeds likely aren’t being verified when they’re submitted and, if a feed’s metadata requests that it not be indexed, Castbox isn’t heeding that ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjl2Xl"&gt;None of these feeds appear to have been uploaded maliciously to Castbox and most have a small number of plays — the damage is minimal. I reached out to the owner of the private RSS for Wetzel’s podcast, and he confirmed that he only meant to listen to this podcast on his own, not to make it public. He “didn’t give it any thought” that the show would become public when he added the RSS feed to listen on Castbox. (&lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; copycat, however, has more than 400,000 plays and over 14,000 subscribers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pL1950"&gt;It’s unclear what’s happening on Castbox’s end. The company says it supports private RSS feeds, but presumably doing so wouldn’t mean making them public. Verifying a feed should also prevent it from going public, as should some of these tags. We’ve reached out to Castbox to confirm the details, but seemingly, the industry’s safeguards failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7FztU0"&gt;Podcasters and app developers clearly see paid memberships as part of the industry’s future, but the risks of private RSS feeds could compromise the industry’s headway. It might even give Spotify and Apple a leg up on competitors that have built entire businesses around locking down the open technology. But even a proprietary solution can’t prevent piracy entirely, and for podcasters, they’ll likely have to accept some risk and rely on the good faith of the podcasting players themselves to keep their shows from going wide.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L6SdX4"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Game Studios is teaming up with Tencent’s TiMi Studios, developer of the wildly successful mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;. According to a Google Translated version of &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4ODA2MjM5Nw==&amp;amp;mid=2656159665&amp;amp;idx=1&amp;amp;sn=7b156d011bbf8ac94212a7383a974175&amp;amp;chksm=8b8a8763bcfd0e757b4b3a0b8eb259f3643ace2de77cf350cbc19aeb204ba78a821311d338be&amp;amp;scene=132#wechat_redirect"&gt;the announcement from TiMi&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies have formed a “strategic partnership” to create “game content,” but it’s unclear exactly what that might mean or when we might be able to play anything resulting from the cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N631Dr"&gt;TiMi Studios is no stranger to adapting hit franchises to mobile: &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; just crossed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timistudios/status/1389760380566601728"&gt;500 million downloads worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the studio is also the developer of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"&gt;upcoming mobile strategy game &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps Microsoft wants to bring some of its biggest titles to mobile platforms in some way. (Not counting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;streaming games over xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o29n2h"&gt;TiMi Studios may very well be the world’s largest developer, having reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22367089/tencent-timi-studios-call-of-duty-mobile-10-billion-2020"&gt;earned $10 billion in revenue in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Its biggest title, the China-only &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, had an eye-popping 100 million &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt; active users as of November, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-honorofkings/tencents-honor-of-kings-reports-100-million-daily-users-expands-into-new-genres-idUSKBN27H1HX"&gt;according to Tencent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Enola Holmes is getting a sequel on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Enola Holmes" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HnPUFPZchWSxwj_-N4XSXTKyL0=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69281291/EH_02421_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Alex Bailey/Legendary&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JfX7Ns"&gt;Sherlock’s kid sister is making a return. Today, Netflix announced &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes 2&lt;/em&gt;, a sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455049/enola-holmes-review-millie-bobby-brown-henry-cavill-netflix"&gt;last year’s crime caper&lt;/a&gt; that took the Sherlock story in a slightly younger direction, focusing on the famous detective’s teenage sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00a2RU"&gt;We don’t have many details about the new movie just yet — such as what it’ll be about or when it’s hitting the streaming service — but at the very least, many of the key figures are returning. That means Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill will reprise their roles as Enola and Sherlock, respectively, and that director Harry Bradbeer and writer Jack Thorne are also on board again. The new movie will be produced by Legendary “in partnership with Netflix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cW3Vxl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The sequel is afoot!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The adventure continues as Millie Bobby Brown &amp;amp; Henry Cavill return to the world of ENOLA HOLMES, reteaming with director Harry Bradbeer &amp;amp; writer Jack Thorne on a second film based on Nancy Springer’s book series about Sherlock Holmes’ brilliant sister.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/7tsr1fbej2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7tsr1fbej2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NetflixFilm (@NetflixFilm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1392872309497737222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A78FtQ"&gt;The movies are based on a series of young adult novels by Nancy Springer. And the first film also holds the distinction of forcing a lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;after the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sued Netflix for giving Sherlock too many feelings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="vtXpJr"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. But even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for a bedroom or a high-end OLED for next-gen gaming, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFCZyo"&gt;Best budget 4K TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3C0Il4"&gt;Best OLED TVs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jVQclk"&gt;Best 4K TVs for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is the most popular size available now. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NyQnT"&gt;Vizio’s M-series 4K TVs have QLED panels, making the lineup one of the better options for color contrast and accuracy. They include four HDMI 2.0 ports, which makes it easy to hook up a variety of set-top boxes or gaming consoles at the same time. This TV is available in four sizes (50, 55, 65, and 70 inches). Sam’s Club is currently offering the 55-inch model at a discount, but only with a valid membership. The 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2F55-4k-hdr-smart-tv-m-series%2Fprod24922142%3Fpid%3Dps_acq_Google_PLA_12454823946%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D501964891149%26wl4%3Dpla-1039532178666%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D1247713%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D%257Bproductid%257D%26wl13%3D%26wl15%3D122079216841%26wl16%3D%26wl17%3D%26wl18%3D%26wl19%3D%26wl20%3DCjwKCAjw-e2EBhAhEiwAJI5jg_04sS80MuYwe-hwlKiK4e18tcM-tbpozYnXmb-tNyWmP1xRGkJd6BoCuTgQAvD_BwE%26wl23%3D1039532178666%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw-e2EBhAhEiwAJI5jg_04sS80MuYwe-hwlKiK4e18tcM-tbpozYnXmb-tNyWmP1xRGkJd6BoCuTgQAvD_BwE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $439 ($40 off)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3LwO3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast while in use. The 55-inch model is available for $798 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDealsDeals04122021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and $799 at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-55-class-6-series-4k-uhd-mini-led-qled-dolby-vision-hdr-roku-smart-tv-55r635%2F6424672.p%3FskuId%3D6424672&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now. You can also get it in 65- or 75-inch sizes if you want something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPfLVC"&gt;Samsung’s Crystal TU-8000 series line of TVs offers many features, such as multiple screen mirroring. Currently, the TU-8000 is available in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 43 all the way to 85 inches. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Crystal-TU-8000-Built/dp/B084JH43DJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$548 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9SocSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a lot for a 4K TV: $500 or less can still get good image quality. This includes Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $380. As the name implies, it offers the option to stream content on services like Disney Plus or Netflix and includes the option to watch live TV. You can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687233984981481#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch model for $350 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Toshiba-50LF621U21-50-inch-Vision/dp/B086VR2KY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or step up to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687411898346509#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model&lt;/a&gt; for just $50 more at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cW4VPC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series line is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants. You can get the 43-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$288 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftcl-43-34-class-4-series-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-roku-tv-8211-43s435%2F-%2FA-52177069&amp;amp;subid1=Best4KTVDeals4192021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$289 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7fy7f"&gt;Hisense’s H6510 model is a good option if you want to buy a 4K LED TV at a competitive price. A Best Buy exclusive, the H6510 includes Android TV software built in and has three HDMI ports. It comes in three additional sizes (65, 75, and 85 inches). Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737592810150199993#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $380 ($20 off its regular price)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ffRx8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch sizes and save up to $200 on it, depending on the size. The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED55BXPUA-Alexa-Built-Ultra/dp/B0829RXYSN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model is currently $1,297 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvNG4d"&gt;Sony’s A8H OLED TV has sterling picture quality and contrast, and it runs Google’s Android TV software. It comes in two sizes, 55 and 65 inches, and the starting price is $1,900. But you can get the 55-inch model for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-A8H-55-Inch-Compatibility/dp/B084KQFNBX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,498 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545415-REG%2Fsony_xbr55a8h_a8h_55_class_hdr.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The 65-inch is also on sale for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545413-REG%2Fsony_xbr65a8h_a8h_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,298 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, about $200 off its usual $2,500 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvRhzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086TSW95T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. There are also 65- and 70-inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OxIzpR"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of the consoles, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEEOlw"&gt;Vizio recently released its first OLED TV, and it remains a good option for people looking to buy a TV that takes full advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X hardware. It supports HDR and HDMI 2.1, so you can game at up to 120Hz in 4K. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738235849043083583#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has a deal on this TV where you can buy the 65-inch for $1,799 ($100 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xr7I2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Alternatively, LG’s CX series of TVs include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and BX is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can grab a 65-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,950 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%22-class---cx-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---%24100-allstate-protection-plan-bundle-included.product.100657326.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;. The latter deal requires a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://costcomembershipoffer.com/Purchase/Purchase/cj?qid=e6583bbeb3f911eb830f05100a1c0e10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco membership&lt;/a&gt;, but it also nets you an Allstate Protection Plan — a three-year warranty for your TV — and a $100 credit toward Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fwgNK"&gt;Samsung’s Q80T is one of the best LCD TVs on the market, and it’s a good option for early adopters of next-gen consoles. The Q80T produces vibrant and accurate colors, supports 120Hz gaming, and includes a variable refresh rate. Right now, you can get a 65-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-inch-Class-QLED-Built/dp/B0845ZSMWS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,698 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or for $1 more at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-65-class-q80t-series-qled-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv%2F6402408.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DwC60TbWZHxyLWTm0RHQK3XRkUkB2RKykExnTVM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D6402408&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/qled-4k-tvs/65-class-q80t-qled-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-tv-2020-qn65q80tafxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s online storefront&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is the latest major company to skip MWC’s in-person show this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IywQI3xUz-250OpuDNYG9PZtnA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280917/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwVjAq"&gt;Qualcomm has announced that it will skip Mobile World Congress’ in-person show in Barcelona this year, making it the latest major company to announce that it will miss the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;potential COVID-19 superspreader event&lt;/a&gt; in June in favor of an online presence at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac822a"&gt;“While we appreciate the health and safety measures being put into place by the GSMA for MWC Barcelona, we have decided that it is in the best interest of our employees and customers for Qualcomm’s participation to be virtual this year,” the company said in a statement &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/qualcomm-wont-be-exhibiting-in-person-at-mwc/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAVkG2fo1pR2bTqIZSfKZd5kxZ9e2u3fNw5XNOikLFfzwDpFDDSR5ulJ9J4Dw_6DQwlpcS1II1EBJ-bdsmKcC-S6dgBjCDb6g3nQtVFinKW_ZUziSHkrdXCMbDpqsVpvX0D9bgpJkZHBWFqEvLCwXS_0NaOjmzdQxv_Tnxpe0wIP"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K9zHH"&gt;Qualcomm is by no means the only major company opting for a digital appearance at MWC this year: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, Nokia, Ericsson, Sony, and Oracle have all pulled out of this year’s show entirely, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430649/samsung-mobile-world-congress-mwc-barcelona-remote-covid"&gt;Samsung and Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they will also attend digitally instead of their traditional in-person appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ECaHxk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MWC insists on holding potential COVID-19 superspreader event in Barcelona","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aChfGB"&gt;MWC 2020 was one of the first major conferences to shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;despite the GSMA’s attempts&lt;/a&gt; to try to put on the show, even with rapidly increasing case numbers around the world and new travel restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2JevQ"&gt;The GSMA is still insisting on holding this year’s event with only minimal COVID-19 mitigation policies, including asking attendees to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of their arrival and plans for “controlling crowd density” — neither of which is expected to be enough to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at an event this large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlRm5e"&gt;In 2020, MWC was only canceled after numerous major companies (like LG, ZTE, Sony, and Amazon) pulled out of the event. And while the GSMA has given no indication that it’ll be looking to adjust its plans for this year’s show yet, it’s possible the increasing number of  exhibitors that won’t be attending could change that. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uMAq3s"&gt;Thursday is Discord’s sixth birthday, and to celebrate, the company is announcing some new features — including one coming in June to help people discover its new Clubhouse-like social audio rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;called Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3fUSG"&gt;The new “Stage Discovery” feature will let you see a feed of public Stage Channels you might be interested in that’s curated using machine learning. You can listen to a Stage Channel’s audio right from the feed, and if you want, you can then hop into the room so that you can be part of the audience. While in a public room, you might also see a link to join the Discord server where the Stage Channel is being hosted if you want to join the community that’s hosting the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrfZwl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10495334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G3VME7"&gt;Once Stage Discovery has rolled out, which Discord tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will happen on June 1st, you’ll be able to access the feed via a new Stage Channels icon found on the main toolbar in the mobile app and in the Home menu on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOtkgs"&gt;Discord says that Stage Channels can’t use profane language in their titles or descriptions, and explicit, graphic, or sexual content is prohibited. Users can report Stage Channels that violate the rules. And to help prevent bad stuff from bubbling up the feed, the company will also enforce its policies through technology, Discord’s own trust and safety team, and community moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAkEXD"&gt;The new discovery feed isn’t the only new Stage Channels feature on the way. Discord is also working on ticketed Stage Channels, meaning hosts will be able to charge for access to a Stage Channel. They’ll be rolling out this month, first in a pilot with fewer than 50 US-based creators. A Discord spokesperson wouldn’t say if it will take a cut of ticket sales, though they noted that the company is evaluating options during the experiment. Discord &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;follows Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in announcing ticketed social audio rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CBjeC"&gt;And for those of you who sometimes find following Discord conversations to be overwhelming (like me), you’ll be pleased to hear that the company plans to add the ability to make threads, which should make it easier to corral conversations. Discord says threads will start rolling out this summer and will be available to all servers before the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxxFp2"&gt;Alongside the new features announced today, Discord is unveiling a new brand identity with a slightly tweaked logo (which, if you didn’t know, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/843764258810814465"&gt;is named Clyde&lt;/a&gt;). You can see the new logo at the top of this post or in this GIF.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AYyRafCiER5IuTA8EsBpcMU_5Y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508348/Discord_IAP_KeyVisuals_Header_01.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uL2ScF"&gt;Discord, which was originally built as a place for gamers to hang out and talk, has grown significantly during the pandemic, particularly as many non-gaming communities have started to use the service. The company revealed that it now has more than 150 million monthly active users, up from 140 million &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/17/discord-raises-100-million-as-its-social-hub-hits-140-million-users/"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose the right printer for your home office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="hp deskjet printer-cb-HP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGt91yOtBxqZd21mak3jRxZoBOU=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66913848/DeskJet_3755_home_office.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTZRSG"&gt;The need for a home / office printer has increased as more of us are working or schooling from home. You could be a parent who needs to print out workbooks for your child. Or you may find that it’s easier to make notes on a business report using a pen or pencil rather than a keyboard. Or you’ve suddenly discovered that a government office is demanding that you snail mail a form to them. Or you’re tired of trekking to your local office supply store for printing out occasional forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrULau"&gt;Whatever the reason, if you find yourself in need of a printer, it’s not difficult to find one. Printers have not changed a lot over the past few years; they’ve just become more efficient and less expensive. You will still be choosing between laser and inkjet printers, color and black-ink-only printers, and print-only and multifunction devices. Because of all these decisions that need to be made, it’s a good idea to figure out what you want before you click “buy” at your favorite shopping site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeqcFN"&gt;In this article, I won’t be telling you which specific printer to buy. But I will go through some of the choices you are going to be faced with and some of the features you may want to make sure you’re getting, including inkjet versus laser, multifunction versus single function, and how to decide what to buy and where to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGVhWI"&gt;So let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sTGRpk"&gt;Inkjet versus laser printers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6m8xC3"&gt;If you haven’t bought a printer lately — or if you haven’t needed a printer until now — you may want a quick refresher on the difference between inkjet and laser printers. What follows is a vast simplification, but it will give you a general idea of how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u4alml"&gt;Inkjet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n04fvi"&gt;Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of liquid ink onto a page. There are several types of inkjet delivery systems, but most consumer systems use separate ink cartridges, each fitted with a printhead that separates the ink into the nearly microscopic droplets. (Professional-level inkjets will usually have separate printheads that can be replaced on their own.) Colors are created by combining different colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qSJmQ"&gt;The number of ink cartridges that a color inkjet printer uses varies. The least expensive printers usually use only two cartridges — one with black ink and one that contains cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. Most lower- to medium-priced inkjet printers offer four separate cartridges — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. More upscale printers will have a different black cartridge for text; printers used by photographers or businesses will have a wider selection of colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXxvrh"&gt;But even the least expensive inkjets can end up running into serious money. The printer itself may not cost more than $50 or $100, but a single set of cartridges can cost nearly as much. And because most color inkjets will not run at all if any one of the cartridges is out of ink (for example, you can’t just print in black if the cyan cartridge runs out), you’ll need to replace any spent cartridges. (We’ll deal more with ink costs later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6zK42"&gt;There are a few inkjet printers out there known as supertank printers, which have refillable tanks that offer a lower cost per page than the traditional ink cartridges. They are sold by a few manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/inkvestment-tank"&gt;Brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fprinters-all-in-ones%2Fg-series-megatank-inkjet-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fecotank-ink-tank-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt; and can be a consideration if you plan to do a lot of color printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="usxWmE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4a31bH"&gt;Laser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVgzp"&gt;These devices use lasers to create static electricity on a rolling drum inside the printer. The static electricity attracts toner (ink in the form of powder), which is melted onto the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fKVka"&gt;While toner cartridges initially cost more than ink cartridges, they also last far longer than liquid ink; as a result, your cost per page will be less. Laser printers also tend to initially cost more than inkjet printers — but they can save money over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjUPwf"&gt;Laser printers have several other advantages over inkjet printers — unless you need color. They are faster than inkjets (especially low-end inkjets, which can be very slow), and the quality of their text printing is more precise (although current inkjets are certainly precise enough to suit most documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda4sL"&gt;Color laser printers are also more available than they used to be. However, they are more pricey, and unless they are professional-level printers, the color will not be as good as an equivalently priced color inkjet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mge797"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NgG53g"&gt;So which should I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hnIqxZ"&gt;There are several other factors that you should consider before purchasing a new printer. Here are some questions to ask yourself while deciding what to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qSaci3"&gt;What am I using it for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PaBtGE"&gt;One way to decide whether to buy a laser or an inkjet printer is to look into what you want to do with it. If color is not important to you, then it’s a no-brainer. A laser printer will be more cost-efficient and faster. But if you want to print out your kids’ computer artwork in color or print the occasional photograph, then you’re probably in the market for an inkjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Dzf4ZV"&gt;Multifunction printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8EIF3S"&gt;If you see yourself working from home for the foreseeable future — or even if you don’t — you may want to consider a multifunction (also known as an all-in-one or AIO) printer. These devices don’t just print from your computer, but they allow you to scan existing documents and either copy them or save them as files. (Some also let you fax a scanned document, but since faxing has become much less necessary, this feature is quickly disappearing.) They are very handy for keeping the paperwork around your home to a minimum since you can save PDFs of most of your papers (especially the ones you’ve had sitting around for years) and then dispose of the actual hard copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLosWg"&gt;(Yes, you can use your phone’s camera to scan and upload documents, and if you only occasionally need to scan a document, that could be enough for you. However, the quality of a phone-scanned document doesn’t come up to the quality of a good scanner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EZELv"&gt;Most consumer-level multifunctions will let you copy anything up to an 8.5 x 11-inch paper (popularly known as letter-sized), but you can also buy printers that will let you handle an 8.5 x 14-inch (legal size) paper. If you see yourself doing a lot of copying or scanning, you should look for a multifunction with an automatic document feeder (usually referred to as an ADF) that lets you move a number of pages through the system quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RcCw64"&gt;Input and output trays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJ3pa"&gt;Most current printers work by pulling paper in from the front, running it around the drum or roller, and then popping it out to the output tray. However, if you’re printing on heavier stock, you don’t want to bend the paper; in that case, you may want to look for a printer that has an input tray coming from the back of the printer, so that the paper is pushed through on a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGyuHK"&gt;Some printers also allow you to have more than one paper tray in front, letting you choose different colored paper, for example, or having one tray hold letter-sized paper and the other hold legal-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f6S3j"&gt;You also want to know how many sheets of paper your input and output trays are capable of holding. If you plan to, say, print out a 200-page manuscript, you don’t want an output tray that is only capable of handling 50 pages, or you could find 150 of your pages strewn over your floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qdzEPd"&gt;Duplexing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f2jCES"&gt;The ability to duplex — to print on both sides of a single page — is more common than it used to be, but not all lower-priced printers include this feature. It’s very useful, especially if you do a lot of printing and want to save on the cost of paper. Of course, most printers let you print on both sides of paper by manually re-feeding the paper into the printer after the first side has been printed — but it can be a real pain in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OLCqoS"&gt;Price per page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2HT7QU"&gt;Without a doubt, the biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink. There is a way to figure out how much a printer will cost you over the long term: calculate the cost per page by dividing the price of an ink cartridge by the cartridge’s page yield or the number of pages you’re expected to get out of each cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrZqtr"&gt;You can usually find the page yield among the stats published by a printer manufacturer for that printer. For example, take two multifunction printers from the same manufacturer, one a color inkjet and one a black-only laser printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lCblbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e209CN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-photo-7155-all-in-one-printer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yield of the HP Envy Photo 7155 All-in-One&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-7155-Printer-Wireless-Printing/dp/B074P4ZS68/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells for about $180&lt;/a&gt;, is about 200 pages for a standard black ink cartridge and about 165 for its standard tri-color ink cartridge. The standard black ink cartridge &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeChooseRightPrinter051221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FHP-64-Black-Original-Ink-Cartridge%2Fproduct_2730291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs about $19&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=VergeChoosePrinter051221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FHP-64-Tri-Color-Original-Ink-Cartridge%2Fproduct_2730292" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tri-color about $25&lt;/a&gt;. So that’s about 10 cents a page for the black ink and about 15 cents for the color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv1Aee"&gt;A similarly priced black-and-white laser printer, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-Monochrome-Two-Sided-4PA41A/dp/B07HB18C2V/ref=sr_1_9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpdp%2Fhp-laserjet-pro-mfp-m148dw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP LaserJet Pro MFP M148dw&lt;/a&gt;, cites about 1,200 pages for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-CF294A-Black-Cartridge-LaserJet/dp/B07J2LZCPF/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard toner cartridge&lt;/a&gt;, at a cost of about $47. That comes out to about 4 cents a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdJFfY"&gt;So assuming that you pump out about 1,200 text-only pages in a year (and excluding the cost of the paper), that means you’ll have paid a total of $47 more for the laser printer and $114 more for the inkjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRWOaU"&gt;One more thing to throw into the mix: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-LC3037BK-High-Yield-INKvestment-Cartridge/dp/B07GBXZRJR/ref=sr_1_4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a black ink tank&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/products/mfcj6545dw"&gt;Brother MFCJ6545DW&lt;/a&gt;, which uses storage tanks instead of cartridges to deliver its ink, costs $33 for a yield of up to 3,000 pages, or about a penny a page. (Because these types of printers — there are several — tend to use a differing number of tanks for color printing, it’s difficult to figure out an equivalent comparison for color printing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwLnKS"&gt;There are, of course, a lot of “ifs” here. For example, when you’re looking at lower-cost printers, some major printer manufacturers don’t publish the page yield. In addition, even when the page yield is available, you have to keep in mind that it is being offered by the manufacturer — so the number of pages you get per cartridge is usually optimistic. Still, this can give you a fair idea of what you’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sZIvBr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496628"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d3YstD"&gt;Wireless connectivity &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G2LxKG"&gt;When you’re purchasing a printer, make sure it is capable of wireless connectivity via Bluetooth, NFC, and / or Wi-Fi — and make sure it is compatible with whatever computer or mobile device you plan to use with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frZS7W"&gt;If you’ve got a Mac computer, an iPad and / or an iPhone, make sure your printer is compatible with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311"&gt;Apple AirPrint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn4DS0"&gt;If you’re using a Chromebook, make sure your printer is Chrome OS compatible by checking the manufacturer site. (For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2FAccessories%2FPrinter-Accessories%2FChromebook-Printing%2Fp%2FCHROMEBOOKPRINT%23worksWithAccessories&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson has a page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all its Chrome OS-compatible printers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dYEKW"&gt;Until recently, another alternative was to use Google’s Cloud Print service, which let you easily print from computers and Android phones. Unfortunately, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;usual disregard for well-loved features&lt;/a&gt;, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977888/google-cloud-print-shut-down-date-support"&gt;shut down its Cloud Print service&lt;/a&gt; as of December 31st, 2020. The company’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006"&gt;rather unsatisfactory advice&lt;/a&gt; (“we recommend the respective platform’s native-printing infrastructure or working with a printing partner”) will probably not be much help for those with older printers or phones that depended on Cloud Print. You can check to see if your printer’s manufacturer has a mobile app that will allow printing from devices wirelessly in lieu of Cloud Print. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDwMV"&gt;Finally, some printers now have NFC capabilities. This lets you can connect one to your phone by simply touching the phone to the NFC label on the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qPtu4n"&gt;Touch and non-touch LCDs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XG6cZr"&gt;Most printers today, even the most basic, come with LCDs that allow you to easily connect to your wireless network and tweak the printer settings — for example, if you want to always print double-sided, or to pull paper from a specific paper cassette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G0Ig7"&gt;Unless you’re really into saving money, you’ll find it easier to deal with a touchscreen. Non-touchscreens usually mean having to hit a combination of buttons to navigate to the feature you want to access, selecting the feature, navigating to the setting, selecting it, and then getting back to the main menu. Touchscreens make that process a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s35ufT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496647"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ex62QD"&gt;Photo printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V9rrsD"&gt;Unless you plan to fill up several albums with physical photos, a photo printer is probably not necessary. Some photo printers offer features like the ability to remove red-eye in photos of people, but this same functionality is commonly available in a number of photo apps (and is probably easier to deal with in software). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdTda8"&gt;There are exceptions. For example, there are small, portable printers such as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CMMHVV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon SELPHY QX10 photo printer&lt;/a&gt; that let you immediately print small (2.7 x 2.7-inch) pictures. These are fun for family gatherings and parties. (Although be aware that you will have to buy special photo paper as well as ink for this one.) And if you’re a professional — or would-be professional — photographer, you may want to invest in a high-level photo printer. But otherwise, most midlevel color printers will — if you use good photo paper — do quite an adequate job. If you’re intending on printing a lot of photos, you’ll spend less and get better results from a photo printing service such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterfly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XePZ98"&gt;Where should I buy it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NMiB13"&gt;Printers are available at almost any online or in-store venues that sell laptops and other computer equipment, such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=printers&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740374987942209261" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fbrowse%2FPrinters-Accessories%2Fci%2F18317%2FN%2F4042754070%3ForigSearch%3Dprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. You can also usually purchase a printer directly from the manufacturer — for example, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeChoosingPrinters051221&amp;amp;platform=dl&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fcv%2Fprinters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.canon.com%2Finternet%2Fportal%2Fus%2Fhome%2Fproducts%2Fgroups%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt; all sell from their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obEQMV"&gt;As with any tech device, it’s always a good idea to check out the product in person before you buy — you may decide, for example, that the inexpensive printer you saw online feels too cheap when you examine it on the shelf. But for the most part, if you’ve checked all the specs online and read a few reviews, you’re pretty safe in ordering your printer remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7b7L1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 13th, 2021, 10:25AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on June 9th, 2020. Prices have been updated, some printers have been named to replace those that are no longer available, and sections on NFC-capable printers, LCDs, and where to buy have been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX inks satellite connectivity deal with Google Cloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At Google Cloud Next ‘19 Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/maHLD7sv9D0G48HmqB8_5C54Giw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280368/1135936636.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bimER0"&gt;Google said on Thursday that it signed a deal with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to use the space company’s growing satellite internet service, Starlink, with its cloud unit. SpaceX will install Starlink terminals at Google’s cloud data centers around the world, aiming to utilize the cloud for Starlink customers and enabling Google to use the satellite network’s speedy internet for its enterprise cloud customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUDXek"&gt;The Starlink-Google Cloud capabilities, which include secure data delivery to remote areas of the world, will be available to customers by the end of 2021, Google said in a press release Thursday morning. SpaceX will install the first Starlink terminal at Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/new-albany/"&gt;New Albany, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, data center, a spokesman said, adding more plans on the partnership will be shared in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3QNm7Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX has about 1,550 satellites of thousands more planned in space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3G4xi"&gt;The deal is a natural alliance for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Google — which, in 2015, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/google-spacex-investment-is-900-million/"&gt;invested&lt;/a&gt; $900 million into the space company to cover an array of technology, including Starlink satellite manufacturing. So far, SpaceX has launched 1,625 Starlink satellites, with about  1,550 currently in orbit. A Starlink beta program that began last year has at least 10,000 users across the US, Canada, and a few European countries, with at least 500,000 deposits of $100 placed by potential customers of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raneDo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251127/elon-musk-bezos-amazon-billionaires-satellites-space"&gt;Competition is fierce&lt;/a&gt; between Musk’s Starlink network and the budding Kuiper Project from Jeff Bezos’ Amazon, which aims to launch more than 3,000 satellites in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405779/fcc-approves-spacex-starlink-lower-orbits-against-amazon-rival-objections"&gt;roughly the same&lt;/a&gt; orbit as Starlink to also provide global broadband internet. The Google-SpaceX deal marks another competitive win for Google in its own rivalry with Amazon’s behemoth cloud services unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon executives have said they aim to leverage internet connectivity from Kuiper to supercharge its AWS cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vDKr2p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Businesses, public sector organizations, and many other groups operating around the world” benefit from the deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AQqVWb"&gt;“Applications and services running in the cloud can be transformative for organizations, whether they’re operating in a highly networked or remote environment,” Urs Hölzle, senior vice president of infrastructure at Google Cloud, said in the press release. Hölzle said Google is “delighted to partner with SpaceX to ensure that organizations with distributed footprints have seamless, secure, and fast access to the critical applications and services they need to keep their teams up and running.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7u24n"&gt;The Google deal involves delivering internet-data “access to businesses, public sector organizations, and many other groups operating around the world,” SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said in the press release. “Combining Starlink’s high-speed, low-latency broadband with Google’s infrastructure and capabilities provides global organizations with the secure and fast connection that modern organizations expect,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqKmcT"&gt;Microsoft, which runs another massive cloud service dubbed Azure that also competes with Amazon’s cloud, also partnered with SpaceX last year in a similar partnership. Putting Azure cloud data through the broadband highway of Starlink, the two companies will be “co-selling to our mutual customers, co-selling to new enterprise and future customers” for data services, Shotwell said in a promotional video at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoMwP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What actually makes something ‘flushable’? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqGKpg06JkXzlkWDF25ql31rQxE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280223/Thumb_TEXTLESS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZRA3rh"&gt;Go to any drugstore or supermarket, and it’s easy to find wipes and other supplies labeled “flushable.” It’s &lt;em&gt;totally fine&lt;/em&gt; to flush those wipes down the toilet, the packaging claims. No problem at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgz0QO"&gt;But according to sewage plants and wastewater experts, those so-called “flushable” products are actually a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem. They might be flushable enough to snake through the toilet’s plumbing, but they don’t disintegrate before they reach the various channels, tanks, and propellers at sewage plants. Instead, they clump up on everything they hit — clogging up the system and, in some cases, even breaking heavy pieces of machinery. Employees have to regularly hand-chisel wipe-boulders out of the innards of the sewage plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VllWkY"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science video team went to see the damage wipes can do — and got up close and personal with the bits of fabric that cost cities millions and millions of dollars each year to manage. Watch our latest video to see what we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
