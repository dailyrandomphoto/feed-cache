    <title>The EV revolution’s next big roadblock: access to chargers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="14FCNy"&gt;Electric vehicles are set to play a critical role in our clean energy future, but in order for everyone to reap the benefits of EVs, they’ll need access to chargers. While the Build Back Better bill &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/12/19/manchin-climate-build-back-better/"&gt;suffered a major setback&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend that could mean significantly less funding for the transition to electric vehicles, there’s still hope that the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/"&gt;bipartisan infrastructure law&lt;/a&gt; passed in November could bring EV charging infrastructure to places that have been left out until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fak77t"&gt;That could make it easier for drivers from marginalized communities to switch to electric vehicles, while also cleaning up the air in their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2JfWDa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The way charging stations are spread out now is neither equitable nor convenient&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2YERa"&gt;The way charging stations are spread out now is neither equitable nor convenient for many low-income communities and neighborhoods of color, experts tell&lt;em&gt; The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; Across the country, the places with the most access to chargers tend to be wealthier and whiter. That’s something the Biden administration could go a long way toward remedying, experts say, as long as it heeds advice that comes directly from those communities. Otherwise, existing disparities could get worse as policymakers hasten efforts to transition to electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMop36"&gt;“There’s probably not a city that you could look at and say that there is a proliferation of charging infrastructure in these underrepresented communities because the strategy was: let’s place charging infrastructure where EV vehicle registration is,” says Terry Travis, managing partner and co-founder of EVNoire, a consulting group that works toward more diversity and equity in the industry. The profile of an average EV driver, Travis says, is still a white guy who lives in the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYnxCj"&gt;With the price tag for an EV &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV_cost_2020_2030_20190401.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to become comparable with gas-powered cars this decade, that could soon change. After EV costs come down, access to charging will be the next biggest hurdle when it comes to replacing gas-powered cars. Today, many EV owners choose to charge up at home in a garage or driveway, but as EV adoption expands beyond individual homeowners to those who rent or live in apartment buildings, public charging infrastructure will become more important. There are only around &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC"&gt;46,000 public charging stations&lt;/a&gt; across the country, and very few of them are fast charging stations that can juice up cars in under an hour. The country will need more than 100,000 fast charging stations by the end of the decade, according to one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822454/power-companies-utilities-ev-fast-charging-network"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xa4HDR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The country will need more than 100,000 fast charging stations &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKbVSq"&gt;In California, which leads the nation in EV adoption, there’s been an uneven rollout of charging stations based on race and income. Census blocks in the state with majority Black and Hispanic residents were “significantly less” likely to have access to a charging station in their area compared to the rest of the state in 2019, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X20309021#!"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this year. The same was true for neighborhoods with incomes lower than the median for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vg7RnB"&gt;“The part that really surprised me [was] learning that the public funded infrastructure somehow is distributed in a less equitable way” than privately funded charging stations, says Chih-Wei Hsu, who led the study as a researcher at Humboldt State University. This disparity is probably the result of the state not being as thoughtful at the onset about how it designed its programs for funding charging stations, Hsu says. It’s a pitfall the Biden administration will need to avoid now that it’s trying to build out a national charging network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiiNqW"&gt;The newly adopted infrastructure law includes $7.5 billion for EV charging infrastructure. That includes $5 billion for states and another $2.5 billion for grants prioritizing rural and “disadvantaged” communities. The goal is to build out a network of 500,000 charging stations across the country that is both “convenient and equitable,” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/"&gt;according to the White House&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLgS1b"&gt;The administration revealed more detailed &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; for charging infrastructure last week when it &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-and-dot-launch-joint-effort-build-out-nationwide-electric-vehicle-charging-network"&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt; a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. The administration committed to getting input from “diverse” stakeholders on how to improve the nation’s charging infrastructure. At early meetings, according to the plan, they’ll discuss environmental justice and civil rights as well as partnerships with local governments and tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFqV3J"&gt;Saving seats at the table for grassroots advocates will be key to making sure marginalized groups don’t continue to get left out, experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. People from marginalized communities will know where to put charging stations that will be the most useful. It can come down to super granular factors like knowing which grocery stores underserved groups are more likely to visit. “When I go to Whole Foods, there’s always a charger,” Hsu says of the organic grocery store. “The clientele at Whole Foods is very different than say, [the supermarket] Vons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29PcNs"&gt;By early next year, the Biden administration plans to issue guidance to states and cities on how to set up charging stations. “This guidance will look at where we already have EV charging and where we need—or will need—more of it. It will focus on the needs of disadvantaged and rural communities,” the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; says. The Federal Highway Commission is also &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/29/2021-25868/development-of-guidance-for-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-deployment"&gt;taking public comment&lt;/a&gt; through January to inform its guidance on charging infrastructure deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN8BS2"&gt;The biggest investment in climate solutions in the US yet was supposed to come through Democrats’ massive budget reconciliation bill. Iterations of it included billions more to install charging stations, including in &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Fact%20Sheet%20on%20E%26C%20Build%20Back%20Better%20Key%20Provisions%20.pdf"&gt;“multi-unit housing structures” and “underserved areas.”&lt;/a&gt; But West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has all but strangled that bill to death. Manchin negotiated to cut down climate provisions on behalf of his state’s fossil fuel industry, before saying over the weekend that he’ll block the bill by withholding his tie-breaking vote. That means even more is riding on the implementation of the infrastructure bill that Congress did manage to pass this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4j0iNj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Policies that help underserved communities transition to EVs could address another environmental injustice: air pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="itKh11"&gt;Policies that help underserved communities transition to EVs could address another environmental injustice, too: air pollution. In addition to being responsible for nearly a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/transport"&gt;quarter&lt;/a&gt; of US greenhouse gas emissions, cars are a big source of pollutants like particulate matter, which &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6001?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=89531294&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9xNvMHn1bWk9yKfonfI3tKRFqpBykQxjDPLwQQ8jOWV6x-lOYIn8RzUEdKwvI0RkzvF9opoWwdz4RPe8VAmXGxrue0heNyHVsPkDmeLZHAAcWSn38&amp;amp;utm_content=89531294&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;disproportionately affect Americans of color&lt;/a&gt;. A 2019 study found that White residents are exposed to 17 percent less air pollution than their individual actions trigger. Meanwhile, Black and Hispanic people in the US are burdened with about 60 percent more pollutants, on average, than they cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMrAPL"&gt;“When we think about who these cars are impacting the most, and who emissions are impacting the most: it’s people in my community,” says Kameale Terry, who lives in South Central Los Angeles, a neighborhood with large Hispanic and Black communities. “And we’re not dumb people. We know that these things are health issues, and we want to be a part of the solution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmqJFe"&gt;Terry co-founded an app called ChargerHelp! that provides on-demand repair services for electric vehicle charging stations. One problem she sees through her business is a lack of &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; charging stations in her neighborhood. Popular places for people to gather, like churches and small businesses, might have gotten initial public funding for a charging station but might not always have the funds to keep it in good condition, she says. Unless the Biden administration starts proactively planning for charger maintenance and repairs, Terry worries that this problem will replicate itself at a national scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwUmdL"&gt;“What we’re seeing today is that there was no type of operations and maintenance money allocated, and we’re seeing the same thing — really it’s a little bit scary — with the infrastructure bill,” she says. ChargerHelp! trains and hires people, many from Terry’s neighborhood, to fix up charging stations for the companies that manufacture and operate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cXK80"&gt;Advocates for cleaner transportation also say that the buck can’t stop with electric vehicles alone. Healthier air and a safer climate will still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;rely on investment in public transportation&lt;/a&gt;. “While expanding EV charging stations is important, the ultimate goal should be to reduce emissions and vehicle miles traveled,” Kevin Garcia, transportation planner for New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, says in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8ME9c"&gt;For folks who live in transit deserts without adequate charging infrastructure or even subway stations nearby, climate and equity solutions boil down to more options for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former head of Sonic Team releases new self-made mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFgzBJNBBIOJb2A9WJtQwgLSDBs=/0x330:4032x3018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298647/FG5AXYJacAIKwLq.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yuji Naka showing off his solo-developer skills&lt;/em&gt; | Image: @nakayuji via Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2eoPOW"&gt;Yuji Naka — former head of Sonic Team — released a new game under his one-man studio Prope called &lt;a href="http://iprope.com/SHOT2048.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Naka was the lead programmer for the original &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; (which seems to be playable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834023/sega-genesis-sonic-1-tesla-arcade"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt; nowadays) and most recently left his short stay at Square Enix to spend his time working on this hyper-casual title for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP75bx"&gt;The goal in &lt;em&gt;Shot2048 &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1594889891"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PropeLtd.SHOT2048"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt;) is to roll dice to the end of an alley and combine (multiply) enough like-numbers to create at least one die valued at 2048. It did take me about five attempts to win my first game... and about four tries to understand the game. There aren’t much in terms of instructions other than this iOS App Store description (though admittedly, after reading it again post-play, it makes sense now):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cQGAYO"&gt;The purpose is to shot the same number and make 2048.&lt;br&gt;The purpose is to shot the same number to make 2048, but aim for more.&lt;br&gt;Tap to move the number left or right, and release your finger to fire the number.&lt;br&gt;If you hit the same number, they will be combined and the numbers will be added.&lt;br&gt;The game is over when the numbers stop in the red game over area in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="dvJrA2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I created a hyper-casual game called [&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHOT2048?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SHOT2048&lt;/a&gt;]. This is the first time in my 37 years as a game creator that I, Yuji Naka, have made a game all by myself. I would appreciate it if you could play it and spread the word. Thank you very much. &lt;a href="https://t.co/vuWmoxO0sj"&gt;https://t.co/vuWmoxO0sj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/LNwQDORXJO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LNwQDORXJO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yuji Naka / 中　裕司 (@nakayuji) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1472186879588331525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3WK54"&gt;It’s a neat idea for a quick time-pass and doesn’t actually require much in terms of math skill since you only really need to match colors and keep the dice out of the shooting zone. The stage gets a bit more challenging as too many dice fill up the play zone; should the dice stay in the shooting zone for too long — about five seconds — the game will be over. The physics can get kinda wonky, but you’ll need to count on some toppling to get the dice in the back to combine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thiCJP-a0HaPD-UKM6yBUuMocNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115535/shot2048.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshots by Umar Shakir / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I won once in Shot2048, might be worth playing again but definitely not with the pay-to-win transactions. On the right is a very similar game called Chain Cube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="67hcWv"&gt;Naka’s game takes clear inspiration from other popular mobile puzzlers like, uh, &lt;em&gt;2048&lt;/em&gt; (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;has its own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/11/8722909/threes-free-to-play-launch-ios-android"&gt;history of cloning&lt;/a&gt;) or another similar title we noticed called &lt;em&gt;Chain Cube&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yIcUC"&gt;The free-to-play game is ad-heavy but will let you remove the ads for $5.99. Also, if you’re having a tough time winning, the game will gladly take $0.99 to give you five more tries. I was also requested by the app to track me, which I declined (though, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22828713/apple-app-tracking-transparancy-psa-privacy-ads-cohorts"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not always a full off switch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHDuVH"&gt;Naka built the game on Unity and says this is the first game he developed alone, touting his 37-year career in the video game industry. The inaugural Prope team (2006) consisted of Naka and 10 former Sega employees targeting the casual &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giantbomb.com%2Fwaggle%2F3015-1035%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F20%2F22846465%2Fyuji-naka-sega-sonic-team-shot2048-iphone-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;waggle&lt;/a&gt; gaming boom, starting with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/06/review-lets-tap-for-the-wii/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s Tap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Wii. Without a team, Naka &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1472934019432337409"&gt;needed some help&lt;/a&gt; getting leaderboards to work for &lt;em&gt;Shot2048&lt;/em&gt; — so he asked for (and received) help on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zHUp55"&gt;iOS 15 has brought with it a number of features that don’t affect your privacy, your efficiency, or your fitness. They’re — well, just nice. One of them is the new ability to change the background of the mobile version of Safari so that when you open a new page, you’re looking at something beautiful or wildly colorful. Or just nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBqVCk"&gt;The process is almost ridiculously simple. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UHuOaj"&gt;Once you’re in the Safari app, you’re going to open a new page. Not sure how to do that? Look for the double square in the bottom-right corner and tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="li37sR"&gt;You’ll see thumbnails of all the pages currently open in Safari. (If there are loads of them, you may want to take this opportunity to get rid of a few.) Tap on the plus sign in the lower-left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To start a new page, tap on the double square in the bottom-right corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_vZvQaVMhzE9WqesAbj6vazk1k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115302/IMG_A3855A225769_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To start a new page, tap on the double square in the bottom-right corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the plus sign in the bottom-left corner." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JyBrBRFnTBxkbtBhHETH3zxoCXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115305/IMG_32F6238563E7_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on the plus sign in the bottom-left corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2VU147"&gt;You’re now on “Customize Start Page.” Look for the “Edit” button and tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pzDZzO"&gt;Now, you can either choose from one of the backgrounds that Apple has included or tap the square with the plus sign to select one of your own. If you chose the latter, you’ll be taken into your Photo app to make a choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the “Edit” button." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ehhn4e0zYDQQwO_kavQh5e9AZ2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115306/IMG_7E603B0DD799_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Edit” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose a preinstalled background image or select one of your own." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bp84HPf14ZLieGkmuFS-OM_8SPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115307/IMG_5E5E22B1280F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a preinstalled background image or select one of your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SX0ntI"&gt;Tap on the image you want to use, and you’ll be brought back to “Customize Start Page.” Your new image has now replaced the square with the plus sign and is highlighted. If you’re happy with your choice, leave the page. If you want to select something else, just tap on that square again to choose something different, or tap on one of the preinstalled Apple backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cP5nPX"&gt;Leave the “Customize Start Page,” and you’ll see that your new Safari page now has a cool new background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your own image will appear where the plus sign was." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6T0FqTrtOdNY-quASnj09nFkpc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115309/IMG_FC9ACAF34B1C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your own image will appear where the plus sign was.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="And now you have a new Safari background!" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Zj5Jrev7_fWZAwe7o7b2z0PGR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115310/IMG_E7C7588E72E9_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And now you have a new Safari background!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>EV startup Canoo loses chief technology officer and two co-founders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvOMzD8OEGVso3glXXgaDeGTdwI=/158x0:1882x1149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298345/Canoo_MPDV_Family.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8vfHd"&gt;EV startup Canoo is losing three top executives, including its chief technology officer Peter Savagian, as part of an apparent shakeup of its leadership team. Savagian, the former chief engineer of General Motors EV1 electric car, will leave Canoo by the end of the year, according to the &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/76/canoo-expands-executive-team-to-execute-business-and"&gt;last line of a press release published Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuv8Sl"&gt;The two others are some of Canoo’s remaining co-founders, two current employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on the condition of anonymity, though they weren’t named in the press release: Bill Strickland, the head of Canoo’s vehicle programs and a longtime Ford executive, and Alexi Charbonneau, who worked at both SpaceX and Tesla and oversaw Canoo’s powertrain division. Strickland and Charbonneau did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Canoo did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCCgb2"&gt;Three of the original founding group remain. Sohel Merchant will replace Savagian as CTO. Richard Kim, Canoo’s chief designer, is now also going to be in charge of creative content and, on an interim basis, merchandising. The third, Christoph Kuttner, remains in charge of the interior and exterior trim of Canoo’s vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QvL0KO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three of Canoo’s nine co-founders remain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8jEoM"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 when former BMW executive Stefan Krause left then-struggling EV startup Faraday Future. Krause and some of the other executives who co-founded Canoo — which was then called Evelozcity — were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947846/faraday-future-lawsuit-trade-secrets-stefan-krause-evelozcity"&gt;sued by Faraday Future for poaching employees and allegedly stealing trade secrets&lt;/a&gt;, though the lawsuit was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1072966577660854272"&gt;settled in late 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1vGav"&gt;Krause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21277248/canoo-ev-startup-stefan-krause-leaving-evelozcity"&gt;left Canoo in June 2020&lt;/a&gt; before it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and became listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. (The details of Canoo’s SPAC merger are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;.) Krause’s replacement — fellow Canoo co-founder and former BMW executive Ulrich Kranz — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;resigned this past April&lt;/a&gt; and took a job with Apple working on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;secretive electric autonomous car project&lt;/a&gt;. Original powertrain lead and co-founder Phil Weicker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;left in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvpBY2"&gt;Canoo’s chief lawyer left at the same time as Kranz, too, though he wasn’t a co-founder. Its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000155837021003592/tmb-20210323x8k.htm"&gt;chief financial officer Paul Balciunas resigned in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxIHUB"&gt;The startup announced Monday that it hired a new chief information officer, Ram Balasubramanian, who has “held senior technology management positions for more than two decades at such companies as Salesforce.com, Motorola Solutions and PepsiCo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9D96L"&gt;Canoo’s priorities have been shifting along with the makeup of its leadership team ever since investor Tony Aquila &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;took over as executive chairman in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, just after the startup went public. (Aquila also took on the CEO role after Kranz resigned.) Since then, Aquila has reoriented the startup towards making commercial electric vehicles mean to be sold to small businesses and fleets. He scuppered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;deal with Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. He shifted Canoo’s headquarters from Torrance, California, to Bentonville, Arkansas, and announced a manufacturing facility in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783974/canoo-moves-to-walmart-hometown"&gt;startup’s new home state&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar"&gt;announcing another one in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Liot5V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6U7JXO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The QuietOn 3 earbuds use ANC to help you sleep</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ8yw8eZ8gbhopA4ToGLLgNz3gc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298318/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q871O3"&gt;I’ve always been a light sleeper, and that has not improved over the last few years. So I thought I was the perfect person to try out the latest version of the QuietOn active noise-canceling earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rULbA7"&gt;The QuietOn 3 earbuds, which cost $239, are the third iteration of these devices. They are smaller than the previous version, the QuietOn 2, but the basic functionality is the same. Unlike other “help to sleep” earbuds such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t generate white noise, or play quiet music, or let you hear rain or other soothing sounds. The idea is simply to eliminate low-frequency noises, such as the hum of a nearby appliance, that may keep you from sleeping while allowing you to still hear an alarm clock going off. &lt;a href="https://quieton.com/technology/"&gt;According to the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the buds are equipped with active noise-canceling technology that uses a microphone to sample the sound and a speaker to create a phase-shifted sound that cancels the original sound. It’s not unlike the noise cancellation systems in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;many popular earbuds available today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The QuietOn 3 earbuds are very small — small enough to wear comfortably at night." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qH8r9A6pojir6qOZlKXQ8bsdqZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115430/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QuietOn 3 earbuds are very small — small enough to wear comfortably at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NLvcGd"&gt;How effective are they? That depends very much on what kind of sleeper you are. I tried the QuietOn 3 buds for several nights and found my success rate — mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsh7WO"&gt;The buds are indeed small and lightweight. They come with four sizes of foam eartips: XS, S, M, and L; you are supposed to compress the foam tips and then place them in your ears and allow the foam to expand to create a seal. Meanwhile, the electronic section of the buds fits neatly into the bottom curve of your ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuLC0w"&gt;I started with the small eartips, but when I still heard sound getting through, I went on to the medium to try to get a better seal. Be prepared to spend some time adjusting these to find the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYmw0e"&gt;My first issue was figuring out which earbud goes into which ear. There is a small “L” and “R” etched into the inner surface of the buds, but they are difficult — make that nearly impossible — to see (I had trouble even with my reading glasses on). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GQOJrgHaTzfke_4X4LGWMzfTpx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115434/bkrasnoff_211216_4936_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s nearly impossible to see the embossed label that tells you whether a bud is for the right or left ear. (Hint: it’s just above the gray eartip.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp03zx"&gt;But even if I was reasonably certain I had the buds in properly, I had trouble figuring out whether they were working. According to the instructions, you can test them by putting the top of the case next to each bud (while it’s in your ear) and moving it slowly away until you hear a click. The problem is that I sometimes thought I may have heard the click, but it was so quiet that I wasn’t quite sure. So finally, I just assumed they were active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeF1Ae"&gt;I will say that the small buds were quite comfortable enough to wear. I’m a side-sleeper and could easily ignore them even when my ear was pressing into the pillow. That’s not something you can easily do with a lot of standard earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5iVZV"&gt;The charging case is also relatively small. Two sets of three LEDs in front let you know whether the buds are powered up (three lit LEDs for fully charged, two for reasonably charged, and if you see a single flashing LED, it’s time to recharge via a USB-C connection). Another set of three LEDs in the back, right above the USB-C jack, tells you whether the case itself is powered. The buds typically lasted two nights without needing to be recharged and might easily have lasted three (although it was easy enough to simply slip them into their case each morning for a power-up). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LEDs at the back of the case let you know whether it needs recharging." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HWLvJpFtWL6XehraNDlkL6WgCro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115433/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEDs at the back of the case let you know whether it needs recharging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUp7bA"&gt;So, how effective are they? I think that can be a very individual thing. They did suppress somewhat the lower-frequency sounds around me, such as street noise and my partner’s occasional snoring. They were also pretty good at protecting me when my neighbor’s baby complained in the middle of the night. According to the website, they are most effective in shielding you from such noises as a recycling refrigerator in the next room or an air-conditioner. But unfortunately, because I’m such a light sleeper, that wasn’t quite enough to really help me stay asleep. Distant sirens, a squirrel scrabbling on my roof, or a truck rumbling past — these all got past the buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTJkuR"&gt;They were actually much more useful when I was trying to concentrate while working. In that case, I could still hear my keyboard and somebody calling me from the other room, but street sounds, the noises from next door, and the hum of a computer fan were dulled enough to let me concentrate better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtSnZI"&gt;So are the QuietOn 3 earbuds worth the cost? I think that depends on how well they work for you. For myself, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt;, which cost only $10 more, were way more effective because they offered a wide selection of sounds that actually masked the noise around me. The QuietOn 3, which only cover a specific spectrum of sounds, are more suitable for calmer environments where you may be occasionally disturbed by a humming fridge or an occasional car going by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evNUrX"&gt;In short: while the box that the QuietOn 3 came in urges you to “Enjoy the Nordic quietude,” I’m afraid Nordic quietude is no match for New York City sirens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vNA7g1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10927414"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Brian Eno is not a fan of NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="brian eno-shamil tanna-01" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FM-EZi2GPcZyJu9GmcJFxOWFVOs=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297916/shamil_tanna_2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u4B6v3"&gt;If you were saving up Ethereum for a set of &lt;em&gt;Discreet Music&lt;/em&gt; NFTs, we’ve got bad news. In &lt;a href="https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Crypto Syllabus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (conducted by longtime tech critic &lt;a href="https://www.evgenymorozov.com/"&gt;Evgeny Morozov&lt;/a&gt;, of all people), Eno outed himself as a skeptic of cryptocurrency — and NFTs in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSan1x"&gt;“NFTs seem to me just a way for artists to get a little piece of the action from global capitalism, our own cute little version of financialization,” Eno told Morozov. “How sweet — now artists can become little capitalist assholes as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="yMARuX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFY9xX"&gt;Best known for his pioneering ambient work and prolific producer credits, Eno seems like the perfect artist for the NFT era. He’s spent decades making art with an eye towards technology and its social implications, often made available as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3475456/brian-eno-scape-ipad-app-ambient-music-creation"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/design/brian-eno-color-changing-turntable-sold-out"&gt;limited-edition product drops&lt;/a&gt;. Eno was a particularly early proponent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music"&gt;algorithmically generated art&lt;/a&gt;, pioneering the same basic process that produced those endless minutely varied monkey portraits for the Bored Ape crew. It would be easy for him to bank a few million pounds by turning this generative iPad app, say, into a string of 10,000 numbered NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtqEBY"&gt;But as he describes it in the interview, taking the NFT turn would be pointless as an artistic move and craven as a financial calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64WPq0"&gt;“I am not sure what is being brought into the world that makes any difference to anything other than some strings of numbers moving about in some bank accounts,” Eno continues. “People I like and trust are convinced they’re the best thing since sliced bread, so I wish I could have a more positive view, but right now, I mainly see hustlers looking for suckers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans management firm accused of having employees talk to fans as influencers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsyJ0jNY653dhhl5Gi2dnRAeDyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297914/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jOsj1k"&gt;A prominent agency that manages accounts for OnlyFans creators has been accused of having its employees catfish fans by reading and replying to messages meant for creators. According to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-onlyfans-star-managers-say-they-catfished-fans-unruly-agency-2021-12?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fans who thought they were talking to models managed by Unruly Agency would confess fetishes, fantasies, and other private matters, but the person on the other end may have actually been an employee of the agency, not the intended recipient — one person who worked as an account manager said they were “basically a professional scammer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eexsX8"&gt;According to the report, Unruly Agency handles accounts for several popular OnlyFans’ influencers. But, according to employees, in addition to helping them schedule photo shoots and manage posts, they also help models deal with the deluge of fans who want to talk to them (and who are often willing to pay for that privilege). This, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says, leads to Unruly’s employees ghostwriting for models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x3pPsi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Former employees say they heard about fans’ failing marriages and fetishes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEHtJV"&gt;Sometimes they’re seeing and responding to incredibly intimate messages — fans, who think they’re talking to someone who they’ve possibly seen naked, will talk about what turns them on or their failing marriages. Putting aside the very real questions about parasocial relationships on the platform that this kind of behavior brings up, fans send those messages believing that someone they think they know will read it and possibly respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Sr3R"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, this type of deception is a grey area when it comes to OnlyFans’ terms of service — one lawyer said it was probably fine, another said it could depend on how a creator pitched their chat services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oWT98L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some creators have accused the company of posting nudes they didn’t want public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSKqlB"&gt;Unruly is also facing allegations that it mistreated its employees, as well as the creators it managed. Multiple creators have alleged that the company or other affiliated agencies inappropriately &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/unruly-contracts-onlyfans-creators-workers"&gt;posted nude content of them&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes outside of their terms (posting it to their public feed, rather than to a more exclusive feed), and sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/onlyfans-model-sues-influencer-management-firm-unruly-agency-2021-8"&gt;without their permission or knowledge that the nude photos even existed&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lawsuit-accuses-unruly-agency-of-wage-theft-wrongful-termination-and-other-illegal-behavior-301422087.html"&gt;lawsuit brought by former employees&lt;/a&gt; accuses the company of wage theft and retaliatory firing (it also reiterates the claims that managers were told to lie about actually being the influencers fans thought they were talking to). You can &lt;a href="https://www.helmerfriedman.com/docs/Machabeli-v-UnrulyAgency.pdf"&gt;read the lawsuit here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrKUkL"&gt;One creator &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/unruly-contracts-onlyfans-creators-workers"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that, when she raised concerns about terms in the contract she was signing, people from the company said the terms wouldn’t be enforced and that they were just in there because it was “what our lawyer makes us do.” When telling her story about trying to leave Behave Agency (which &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/unruly-agency-promises-online-fame-this-influencer-says-they-posted-her-nudes-and-threatened-her-instead"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; describes&lt;/a&gt; as “Unruly’s spinoff for smaller influencers”) and being hit with a $300,000 fee, she said, “They have such a big company, I just would have never imagined that they’d be so desperate to trap anybody.” That creator also said that Behave changed the banking details on her OnlyFans account, making so that the money went to the company instead of to her directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsHm8w"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s precedent for many of the elements of this story. The adult entertainment industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/15/why-are-people-silent-about-the-abuses-and-exploitation-in-porn"&gt;a reputation for exploiting and abusing workers&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a long history of online content creators feeling as if they’ve been &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/some-youtubers-are-overjoyed-that-maker-studios-is-firi-1792854530"&gt;treated unfairly by management platforms&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also seen accusations of corporate catfishing before — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/are-ashley-madisons-fake-profiles-legal-2013-11"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/08/25/ashley-madison-faked-female-profiles-to-lure-men-in-hacked-data-suggest/"&gt;analysis of hacked data&lt;/a&gt; from extramarital dating website Ashley Madison (whose slogan was “Life is short. Have an affair”) indicated that the company created fake profiles that would send messages to men.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for The Witcher: Blood Origin on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06aCYr7uZD846m1bINz2TKbywr8=/0x1:4096x2732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297899/FG0JNfQWQAkXjfV.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UrHvvu"&gt;There’s more to &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe than just Geralt, and Netflix gave the first glimpse at that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mawzQRu1Kc4"&gt;with an early look at &lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The trailer was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22692726/witcher-blood-origin-trailer-cast-netflix"&gt;initially revealed as a post-credits scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; season 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;which debuted on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2xH3H"&gt;The upcoming live-action prequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;stars Michelle Yeoh as a sword elf&lt;/a&gt;, and it takes place well before the main series, covering the events that led to the creation of witchers in the first place. Netflix describes the series as an “epic prequel series depicting the creation of the prototype witcher and the events leading to the pivotal ‘Conjunction of the Spheres.’” (For more on the conjunction, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22839928/witcher-multiverse-physicist-explains"&gt;check out this interview&lt;/a&gt; on the scientific possibilities of the multiverse.) The show is slated to debut on Netflix sometime in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9RiDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt; is just one part of an almost MCU-style universe that Netflix is trying to craft around &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. The tentpole is the live-action series starring Henry Cavill, which just debuted its second season, but there are multiple spinoffs, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;an anime prequel called &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNwruH"&gt;Meanwhile, 2022 is shaping up to be a great year for fans of Michelle Yeoh. In addition to wielding a sword in &lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;, she’s also tackling a multiverse of her own in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834049/michelle-yeoh-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-trailer"&gt;the trippy-looking &lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which hits theaters next March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OP7lPoF9NjIHj15Xk3XaYcX_0Y=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297871/1230436485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mh8joz"&gt;There’s something extraordinarily frustrating about subscribing to a TV service only for that service to lose the programming you signed up for. But that threat of lost channels — or worse, the actual loss of major networks — is a recurring problem for internet TV services, and it comes up &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cFpe8"&gt;The latest incident hit just this weekend: late Friday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; Disney-owned channels, including ESPN and FX, disappeared from YouTube TV when the two companies failed to reach a deal to keep them on the streaming service. The dispute didn’t last long. Just 36-or-so hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845373/youtube-tv-disney-espn-channel-fx-abc-restored"&gt;the companies came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; — soon enough to avoid anyone missing ESPN’s Monday Night Football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y250tf"&gt;It was an outcome Disney could pretty much bank on. “Great content always wins and has great leverage,” Keith Zubchevich, CEO of streaming data company Conviva, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Audiences want the best content, regardless of where they pay for it or watch it. It’s up to aggregators and big platforms to make sure they get the deal done, especially in streaming where consumer choice is even greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0iMSo"&gt;Seeing two companies publicly duke it out over contract negotiations like this has become commonplace. In July, Fubo TV lost &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/tv/2021/07/ae-history-lifetime-channels-dropped-by-fubotv-in-what-company-deems-a-cost-cutting-measure.html"&gt;several channels&lt;/a&gt; from A+E Networks, including History Channel, Lifetime, and A&amp;amp;E. Hulu with Live TV has lost &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/sinclair-rsn"&gt;support for some Fox regional sports channels&lt;/a&gt; last year, while Sling TV lost &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/great-now-sling-tv-and-dish-are-losing-masn-and-nbc-re-1846603206"&gt;NBC regional sports networks&lt;/a&gt; in April. YouTube TV has publicly sparred with Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; in the past four months alone, reaching last-minute deals that allowed users to continue using their services or platforms as they had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rjMPg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They essentially want the consumer to get mad.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqWqGf"&gt;Each time, these negotiations broke out into public view, letting subscribers know their service’s channel selection may be on the line. So why play up the drama and send subscribers into a tizzy — or worse, have to issue rapid-fire news updates about dropped and subsequently restored service — when more often than not, a resolution is the most likely outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyWeAn"&gt;“They’re all playing to the same audience, which is the consumer. They essentially want the consumer to get mad,” Zubchevich says. “It’s all about a narrative in the public perspective that is essentially trying to maintain: how are viewers going to hold value in different brands?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kj4pU"&gt;In streaming, content is only as valuable as its ability to hang on to customers. So while Disney and YouTube TV were unable to reach a deal initially last week, YouTube TV clearly foresaw the impact the loss of those channels could have on its business. Disney is the parent of ESPN, and YouTube TV was positioned to lose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;five ESPN properties&lt;/a&gt; should the two parties have failed to reach an agreement. With Monday Night Football in full swing, the impact on YouTube TV’s business would have almost certainly been brutal. So it’s no shock that YouTube TV worked diligently to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o84I1Q"&gt;“Sports has always been a genre of entertainment, much like movies, that drives engagement, drives subscribership, that drives viewership,” Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with Parks Associates, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The collective sports content community understands the value of what they’re offering. They can drive engagement and subscribership arguably like no other genre in any video. So they know that their content is of value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ryHGIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1IrzTn"&gt;These disputes are part of the growing pains that come with making content deals in such a new space. Zubchevich says networks don’t want to make long-lasting deals because it’s hard to estimate what their content will be worth even a couple years out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA1mvc"&gt;“Carriage deals are so short because viewing is growing so rapidly, it’s nearly impossible to quantify a multi-year deal or predict what viewing will look like on a longer timeframe,” Zubchevich says. “And it’s so last minute because they’re trying to determine whether content or eyeballs are king — waiting to see who will blink first as it plays out in public view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SP8BY"&gt;Plus, new ad formats and distribution options make streaming-era negotiations for content even more complex, Anjali Midha, co-founder and CEO of analytics company Diesel Labs, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ3Kt2"&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential,” Midha says. “There’s also the need to maintain much more flexibility given the industry is still transforming around us. As a result, it’s not a big surprise that the negotiations are much more complex and taking longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS1oLI"&gt;Youtube TV and Disney may be resolved, but the tight turnaround may just suggest the strategy works — wait till the last second, alert consumers, and fight for a better deal — and we’ll see more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
