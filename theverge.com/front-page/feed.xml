    <title>GM and LG Chem will reportedly announce Tennessee battery factory on Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TAByQlshoindLbrk4X5kLzQj5Wg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69135443/GM_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFgCkZ"&gt;On Friday, General Motors and LG Chem are expected to announce a new $2.3 billion battery factory to be located in Spring Hill, Tennessee, say reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/LG-and-General-Motors-expected-to-set-up-EV-battery-plant-in-US"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-announce-second-us-battery-plant-tennessee-with-lg-chem-sources-2021-04-14/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/gm-expected-announce-tennessee-battery-plant-friday-77102235"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It would be the second US battery joint venture for the American and South Korean giants, after the pair first announced a $2.3 billion battery cell manufacturing plant in Lordstown, Ohio back in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZWkvx"&gt;The Spring Hill batteries will be used for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; electric SUV, say sources speaking to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. GM already announced that Lyriq will be powered by GM’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;scalable battery architecture called Ultium&lt;/a&gt;. Batteries based on Ultium would offer power ranging from 50 to 200 kWh that could allow for a driving range of 400 miles or more. The Cadillac Lyriq will be assembled at a Spring Hill plant starting next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oo6fwX"&gt;GM grew to be the largest automaker in North America on the back of combustion engines. Now it needs to ramp up production of electric vehicles in order to become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt;, and meet its goal to halt sales of light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2035. Having a ready supply of batteries is therefore a fundamental concern for GM’s future. The company had already vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025 and even redesigned its logo to look more like an electrical plug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Silicon Valley’s Clipper all-in-one transit card finally adds Apple Pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bgr7rKNpctXB6qHCg5snumj5Akg=/0x0:1025x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134477/clipper_iphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPelC0"&gt;Silicon Valley might seem like a shining beacon of technological progress to some onlookers, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;natives know&lt;/a&gt; it can be weirdly hit and miss — like how the San Francisco Bay Area has long had a &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; tap-to-pay card that’ll let you onto practically every form of public transit, and yet never let you simply tap your phone or smartwatch to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="daXw9q"&gt;Until today — because starting today, &lt;a href="https://mtc.ca.gov/whats-happening/news/clipperr-launches-iphone-and-apple-watch-debuts-new-mobile-app"&gt;the Clipper Card supports Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt;, including its Express Mode where you don’t need to wake the device or open an app first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiZ8h6"&gt;You can now use almost any recent iPhone or Apple Watch to board BART (which serves the East Bay and San Francisco), Muni (San Francisco’s bus and light rail system), Caltrain (which connects San Francisco to the peninsula and South Bay), VTA (South Bay buses and light rail), and even the ferry. (&lt;a href="https://transit.applepay.apple/san-francisco"&gt;Find instructions here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9NXfIs8r5YRG4wYjH2wUeevMqPo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447652/bam_map_orig.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Map by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.alexanderli.net/design/sfbamm" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a pretty good picture of the SF Bay Area’s interlocking transit systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bCYsaN"&gt;That means travel across practically the entire urban and suburban Bay Area without pulling a wallet out of your purse or pocket — particularly since many of those vehicles also fit bikes on board. It’s not quite as significant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13401092/apple-pay-japan-suica-felica-nfc"&gt;as when Apple Pay came to Japan’s Suica in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, since that rail network spans an entire country, but it’s a big deal for tech workers and natives like me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xv3gbN"&gt;Or it would be, if I ever work in an office again. Not much demand for that at the moment! But I used to take the Caltrain &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; either BART or Muni to work each day, and Clipper was my constant companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq5Ewa"&gt;There are a few caveats still: you can only load any given Clipper Card onto a single device, so you can’t share it across an iPhone and an Apple Watch simultaneously. (You can just use two cards, though, and it supports a variety of Clipper passes, not just cash.) You’ll also need an iPhone 8 or later, or an Apple Watch Series 3 or later, and Apple warns that you should “keep your plastic Clipper card for Bay Wheels bikeshare use and your RTC [disability discount] card for fare inspection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVaU5F"&gt;Android users with Clipper Cards should see similar capabilities via Google Pay later this spring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287043/google-maps-pay-parking-public-transportation-cities"&gt;and you should be able to buy a card directly through Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D10nF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store hosted kiddie games with secret gambling dens inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0LZ9nJLSZ4OeSuHlIF-Xa1aNEo=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134221/terrible_gambling_app.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RhM0S"&gt;In popular culture, access to an illicit gambling den is as easy as stumbling into the right shop and saying the password — or greasing some palms. Apple’s App Store apparently has a real-life parallel: today, app developer Kosta Eleftheriou discovered a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; kiddie game that’s actually a front for gambling websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJWKDA"&gt;The secret password isn’t one you’d be likely to guess: you have to be in the right country —or pretend to be in the right country using a VPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KtbSIV"&gt;But then, instead of launching an ugly monkey-flipping endless runner game filled with typos and bugs, the very same app launches a casino experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AjfMMO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a silly platformer game for children 4+, but if I set my VPN to Turkey and relaunch it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s IAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/crnOOF0pNi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/crnOOF0pNi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750329972805633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqH4eB"&gt;The app, “&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1546731180"&gt;Jungle Runner 2k21&lt;/a&gt;,” has already disappeared from the App Store, presumably thanks to publicity from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-ios-game-secretly-turns-into-a-gambling-app-1846693222?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/15/eleftheriou-turkish-casino-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who each wrote about Eleftheriou’s finding earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHIgJH"&gt;It’s not the only one, though: the same developer, “Colin Malachi,” had another incredibly basic game on the App Store called “Magical Forest - Puzzle” that was also a front for gambling. I tried them both myself, and here’s some visual evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsE6EBjU55YPHvUqGouoXePJij0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447520/gif_scam_apps.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVzpHf"&gt;Here’s what Magical Forest looked like when you opened it from the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JbJoJZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10449066"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X1sdmf"&gt;I accessed them from a VPN server in Turkey; While &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball &lt;/em&gt;notes that users in other non-US countries like Italy also seem to have been able to access the gambling sites, I tried them with a number of other locations including Italy without success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmkf3F"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;the multi-million dollar App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; that Eleftheriou uncovered earlier this year, it’s not hard to see why Apple’s App Store review program might have missed these — they largely look like your typical shovelware if you don’t know the trick, with only a handful of tells... like the fact that Jungle Runner uses a Pastebin for its privacy policies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WeQPxzwFu1dkZMM6kcelor3xFo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22447552/pastebin_jungle_runner.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q46Ola"&gt;It’s not necessarily clear to me that they’d be violating very many of Apple’s App Store policies, either. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#gaming-gambling-and-lotteries"&gt;Gambling apps are permitted by Apple,&lt;/a&gt; as long as they’re geo-restricted to regions where that gambling is permitted by law, and you could maybe argue that’s exactly what this developer did by checking your IP address. But I imagine Cupertino would frown on a gambling app masquerading as a kid’s game either way — and Eleftheriou suggests the gambling sites may be scamming people out of money, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IlyJoT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As an icing on the cake, people in the reviews say that they deposited large sums for the promise of a bonus, but they never received the promised payouts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising no one, the scammers aren’t even operating a fair casino.&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382750376978313226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JYkbVJ"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bplVAO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbKF23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVzh3I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYPFkP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb2uTD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Resident Evil 4 VR remake is launching on Oculus Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QNdqZkV2eeEO14MSqxFAo7f2gXk=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69134047/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JgcRx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; will be rereleased in virtual reality on the Oculus Quest 2 headset. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4’s &lt;/em&gt;VR remake will be a collaboration between series publisher Capcom, Oculus parent company Facebook, and the independent studio Armature. While Capcom didn’t offer much detail, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2NBKqjKcAeo?t=2930"&gt;some early footage&lt;/a&gt; shows a first-person adaptation of the classic third-person shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFBjzH"&gt;Capcom announced its news during a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; showcase that also included a new trailer for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386449/resident-evil-village"&gt;non-VR &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Oculus and Facebook Reality Labs will reveal more about the game on April 21st, when Facebook is holding its own VR showcase for the Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2t2xPb"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series has tried VR before. The 2017 first-person game &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; let you play through the entire game with a PlayStation VR headset, which made the game arguably scarier but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14369624/resident-evil-7-ps4-playstation-vr"&gt;more difficult to play&lt;/a&gt;. Capcom also released a &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0102-CUSA06799_00-BH70000KITCHEN01"&gt;VR-only demo&lt;/a&gt; for that game. But this is the first full &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game that seems specifically designed for VR — and specifically for Facebook’s standalone Oculus Quest 2. (While it’s not clear whether &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 &lt;/em&gt;will also support the original Quest, Oculus has pushed to make Quest games compatible with both headsets in the past.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nzkix"&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt; remake that fans have called for, and non-VR users may still want to focus on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309983/resident-evil-4-hd-project-remake-remaster-mod-pc-textures-graphics"&gt;fan-funded remaster&lt;/a&gt; of the original game. But it looks like the series’ first foray into making games specifically for VR — something that could provide a very different experience than adding headset support to a non-VR game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can play the second demo for Resident Evil Village on May 1st, or earlier on PlayStation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SNP-bpbztMheYeU1Yj60Fw0Q2vg=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133843/re_village_jan21_screens_creature_01_1611268587718.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yr8voq"&gt;During today’s Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom announced that a second demo for its upcoming survival horror game, &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village,&lt;/em&gt; will release on May 1st. That’s six days before the game’s official release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8iFxg"&gt;Unlike the previous “Maiden” demo, this demo will be playable on all platforms the game will releases on, including PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Windows PC (via Steam), and Stadia. The demo will allow you to play for 60 minutes and explore both the village and castle areas, regardless of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI1rIi"&gt;PS4 and PS5 users will have the option to preload the demo beginning today via the PlayStation Store. Additionally, players on these two platforms will receive early access to the demo on two separate weekends — April 17th at 5PM ET through April 18th at 4AM ET, and April 24th at 5PM ET through April 25th at 4AM ET. Each demo weekend will provide up to 30 minutes of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMDOXs"&gt;Capcom also released the fourth trailer for the game, which includes new footage and another look at Lady Dimitrescu. &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 7th on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, and Stadia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fyre Festival settlement reveals the true cost of schadenfreude — $7,220 a pop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmHOcSWZM7hNt9XE516mUIIycdg=/0x11:1184x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133701/fyre_festival_poster.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fyre Festival LLC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTKLcI"&gt;The organizers of Fyre Festival — think: The Hunger Games, but for influencers — have agreed to a settlement with 277 attendees for $7,220 apiece, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/arts/music/fyre-festival-settlement.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYK4el"&gt;Tickets for the 2017 “luxury” music festival on a remote island in the Bahamas that actually turned out to be a beach full of FEMA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WNFIV/status/857744138019753984"&gt;tents&lt;/a&gt; and some pathetic cheese sandwiches, cost anywhere from $1,000 to as much as $12,000 — more if you bought a package deal. Yes, really, because Fyre Festival organizers, while apparently not adept enough to coordinate hotel bookings and a caterer, did enlist big-name Instagram stars to sing the praises of the inaugural event, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/4/15547734/fyre-fest-kendall-jenner-instagram-sponsored-paid"&gt;Kendall Jenner, who received $250,000&lt;/a&gt; for a post she’s since deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pc6bFT"&gt;Organizers also (falsely) claimed that the island was once owned by notorious Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Weird flex, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WYadx2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mz5kY3RsmKo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rv0szz"&gt;Jenner did not attend the event, but she too, eventually paid for it, in the form of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kendall-jenner-pay-90-000-settlement-promoting-fyre-festival-n1212011"&gt;$90,000 settlement&lt;/a&gt; last year. Organizer &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/music/fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-fraud.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;Billy McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges. He was also &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fyre-festival-attendees-win-5-million-lawsuit-695806/"&gt;ordered to pay $5 million&lt;/a&gt; to two people who paid $13,000 each for VIP packages (did the sandwiches come with extra cheese slices?). McFarland’s business partner, rapper Ja Rule, was &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ja-rule-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-major-fyre-fest-lawsuit-2576105"&gt;cleared of wrongdoing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtYThj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;hunger games, but for influencers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K3oXrn"&gt;The festival that became a go-to example of schadenfreude and (yet another) cautionary tale about believing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15471112/fyre-fest-instagram-hailey-baldwin-bella-hadid-sponsored-posts"&gt;sponcon on social media&lt;/a&gt; was eventually the source of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-or-hulu-which-fyre-festival-documentary-you-should-watch/"&gt;two documentaries, for Hulu and Netflix&lt;/a&gt;. And because time is a flat circle, the tweet of the “dinner” from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373477/fyre-fest-tweet-sandwich-auction-nft-medical-expenses"&gt;Fyre Fest is being offered for auction as an NFT,&lt;/a&gt; but at least the money there should go to a good cause: original tweeter Trevor DeHaas is having a kidney transplant and says he needs to raise $80,000 for medical expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OM6Yrd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The dinner that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fyrefestival?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; promised us was catered by Steven Starr is literally bread, cheese, and salad with dressing.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fyrefestival?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fyrefestival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I8d0UlSNbd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I8d0UlSNbd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Trevor DeHaas (@trev4president) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trev4president/status/857776562615308288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pjH74g"&gt;The $2 million class-action settlement, reached in US Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, is currently awaiting final approval, with a hearing scheduled for May 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXfBmt"&gt;The final amount attendees receive could eventually be reduced, depending what happens with other creditors in Fyre Festival’s bankruptcy case. But at least the ticket holders have already had some practice in getting less than they were promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cBmAv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please keep Anish Kapoor away from the whitest white paint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man with sunglasses on holding up a panel with a very bright white square painted on it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gdbKYAQ4QhRaFyQ_CgWHDZHAih0=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133636/ruan_xiulin_portraitLO.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiulin Ruan, one of the researchers who made the whitest white paint, holding up a sample. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jared Pike / Purdue University&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbkCOr"&gt;Researchers at Purdue University say they have created the whitest paint on record. In fact, they’ve now crafted an ultra-white paint twice: in October, &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q4/this-white-paint-could-reduce-the-need-for-air-conditioning-by-keeping-surfaces-cooler-than-surroundings.html"&gt;they announced&lt;/a&gt; a white paint that was capable of reflecting 95.5 percent of sunlight. But they decided to outdo themselves with a new formulation, &lt;a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/the-whitest-paint-is-here-and-its-the-coolest.-literally..html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, that reflects up to 98.1 percent of sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QX2ttC"&gt;The thing about a very white paint is that, along with reflecting light, it also rejects heat. As any goth who has spent the day on the beach knows, black absorbs light and will heat up. The hope with an ultra-white paint is that it could be used on buildings to keep them cooler without air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td5Lfs"&gt;The science of the paint comes down to a high concentration of barium sulfate, a compound that’s already used in paints and photographic paper. The barium sulfate particles are different sizes, allowing the paint to scatter a broader range of light than if they were all the same size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjZTGS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have concerns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OndOh"&gt;This all sounds very cool, but I have concerns. And that’s because one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2017/07/anish-kapoor-blackest-black/"&gt;well-known dramas&lt;/a&gt; in the art world has to do with the blackest black: Vantablack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1gSSI"&gt;Vantablack is a material made with nanotubes that is able to absorb up to 99.99 percent of visible light. The most accessible form of it, a sprayable paint called Vantablack S-VIS, is exclusively licensed to the studio of Anish Kapoor so that he can monopolize the ability to make such groundbreaking artworks as... &lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/man-injured-falling-into-anish-kapoor-hole-1335176"&gt;a big black hole in the floor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVF7YZ"&gt;Kapoor’s hogging of Vantablack incensed other artists so much that another artist, Stuart Semple, created “the world’s pinkest pink” pigment. (It’s unclear if it actually is the pinkest pink, but I guess scientists are still busy with black and white.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLHirM"&gt;The pink is available for anyone to buy, except for Anish Kapoor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Cw6Jlg"&gt;By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fLcu5n"&gt;The beef did not stop there, however, because Kapoor got his hands on the pinkest pink and posted to Instagram an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOWz73wgj7R/"&gt;extremely classy photo&lt;/a&gt; of his middle finger coated in it, with the caption, “Up yours.” Great guy, love the attitude. Semple then went on to create &lt;a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/features/art/anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-vantablack-blackest-black"&gt;his own ultra-black pigments and paints&lt;/a&gt;, which are available to everyone except, you guessed it, Kapoor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jLB6o"&gt;So please, researchers who are bringing us ultra-white paint, do not let Anish Kapoor get anywhere near it. Ideally, anything that could be used to improve people’s lives while reducing the energy they use should be free and widely available. And my fragile psyche just can’t handle more paint-based art battles. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tried to coerce Ecobee into collecting private user data, the WSJ reports  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGT8ott5M-oppfKpZ1FPgu8xQkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133546/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSPwvU"&gt;Amazon tried to use its power to coerce Ecobee into using its smart home products to collect user data by threatening Ecobee’s ability to sell its products on Amazon, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-strong-arms-partners-across-multiple-businesses-11618410439"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOke6e"&gt;As of now, Ecobee’s products can still be purchased on Amazon, but the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;claims that negotiations between Ecobee and Amazon are ongoing. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ,&lt;/em&gt; the online retail giant asked Ecobee to share data from its Alexa-enabled smart thermostats, even when the customer wasn’t actively using the voice assistant. Ecobee reportedly refused to have its devices constantly report back to Amazon about the state of the user’s home, including data on which doors were locked or unlocked and the set temperature. The reasoning being that enabling its devices to report this data to Amazon would be a violation of its customer’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r71g2U"&gt;Ecobee may have also been concerned that Amazon wanted the data to build competing products. The retail giant has a reputation for taking non-public sales data and using it to develop products — something that’s come up in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;antitrust investigations in the US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;and EU&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has also been accused of using this sales data to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag"&gt;directly copy and compete with&lt;/a&gt; other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233121/amazon-employees-seller-data-private-label-products"&gt;using its Amazon Basics brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0v54t"&gt;It’s not hard to look at the web of products and services it offers and see the potential abuses: the same&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-strong-arms-partners-across-multiple-businesses-11618410439"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; also outlines how Amazon uses its position in web hosting services and TV streaming boxes (sold under the Fire TV brand) to negotiate with content providers like HBO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idTruy"&gt;The full report is well worth a read if you want an idea of all the different markets Amazon operates in that it can use to get its way when dealing with other companies. For an in-depth look into Amazon’s specific dealings with its Marketplace system, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;have an explainer&lt;/a&gt;, and we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233121/amazon-employees-seller-data-private-label-products"&gt;have also covered&lt;/a&gt; the news &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;as it happened&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195719/amazon-antitrust-wsj-investigation-competition-marketplace-sellers"&gt;as reports like this pile up&lt;/a&gt;, regulators may have no choice but to step in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts0af9"&gt;Amazon declined to comment, stating that it doesn’t talk about agreements with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn off autoplay videos on Facebook, Twitter, Firefox, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_WcNM6N2MSX0rUaCurpm8upBUJc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67357666/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8lG2AH"&gt;You’ve probably been caught off guard by videos that play automatically on Facebook, Twitter, or just across the internet in general. They begin playing as soon as you load a page or (if they’re more deviously implemented) when you start scrolling through a page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEO2XA"&gt;Automatic video play is a feature that, while nice to have when it’s surfacing content that’s related to your interests, can be pretty annoying. Autoplay videos can be harmful, too, exposing you to violent, offensive, or otherwise unwanted content that you shouldn’t have to see by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y0j3a"&gt;Whether you just want to put an end to autoplay videos on social media platforms or are looking for a more comprehensive fix, we’ve got some tips. Keep in mind that you’ll need to adjust these settings for every device that you use, since your preferences on, say, your phone do not automatically push to your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dz1chzzX-NIN7haE3ax0cMWBuyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10595581/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o58gm4"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gIrA8R"&gt;If you’re using Facebook on your browser, you can turn off autoplay videos this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tpH6zh"&gt;Go to the drop-down menu at the top right of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rR3w9L"&gt;Select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ODd3mQ"&gt;Look for the “Videos” listing on the left-hand menu. Inside of that option is a toggle where you can turn off autoplaying videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="J84Eng"&gt;Facebook has similar options available for its iOS and Android apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ULMfxN"&gt;Using the iOS app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="R977sA"&gt;Click the menu button on the bottom of your screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xSoMTh"&gt;Once you’re there, tap “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy,” then “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7Af4MO"&gt;Scroll down until you find “Media and Contacts,” then tap “Videos and Photos.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iwxDqT"&gt;Finally, once you find “Autoplay,” you can turn off the feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vgY1Dg"&gt;Using the Android app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oEGb9P"&gt;Click the menu button at the top right of your screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JcW48A"&gt;Once you’re there, scroll down and tap “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy,” then “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eIhn7b"&gt;Scroll down until you find “Media and Contacts” and tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7o3J7l"&gt;Tap on “Autoplay” and set it to “Never Autoplay Videos.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WpKybIufqxWpjmPHLUSeDwX1s0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10125279/acastro_180130_1777_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xH0GDk"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TC0CDS"&gt;Click on “More” in the left-hand menu, and then on “Settings and privacy.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MF20gk"&gt;Select “Accessibility, display, and languages” &amp;gt; “Data usage”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Dq3GjI"&gt;Click on the “Autoplay” setting. You can then switch off the autoplaying of videos on your feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="C2u16D"&gt;Using the iOS and Android apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RrUSNS"&gt;Click the profile picture at the top of your phone screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3UQZtK"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” in the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11NK0Y"&gt;Navigate to “Data usage,” tap on “Video autoplay” and set it to “Never.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7OQSxm"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dUNrI4"&gt;Instagram doesn’t allow for autoplay videos to be turned off, so you’ll have to tread carefully here. Videos won’t autoplay with sound if you use Instagram on your browser. Stopping autoplay on mobile devices is possible, but a little roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lt8HsS"&gt;Using a mobile app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XPW4FK"&gt;Go to your profile page and tap on the three lines in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bNwWy7"&gt;Go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Account” &amp;gt; “Cellular Data Use” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MVxu9x"&gt;For Android: toggle the “Data Saver” on and tap on “High Resolution Media.” If you then select “Never,” then media such as videos won’t load in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWdWJR"&gt;For iOS: toggle on “Use Less Data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gBk22znaU2hqkqcLOv799EsVOYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10646761/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tXOQ6e"&gt;Reddit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SzwWxv"&gt;Reddit, like most sites that host video, autoplays videos by default. However, it’s pretty easy to turn it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Eu0DWx"&gt;Using the newest design &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ay5Rtq"&gt;Click your username in the upper-right corner and select “User settings” in the menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cvJBQ6"&gt;Select the “Feed settings” tab at the top of the page, and toggle off the “Autoplay media” switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5RlMWj"&gt;Using the legacy version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JwvewK"&gt;Click “Preferences” next to your username in the top right of the window. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OcS1gc"&gt;Under “Media,” look for and uncheck “Autoplay Reddit videos on the desktop comments page.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="94bprV"&gt;You’ll need to hit “save options” at the bottom of the screen to put the changes through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5u20jl"&gt;Using the mobile app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rGcnzL"&gt;Tap the icon next to the search bar, then hit “Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bpIbQJ"&gt;You’ll see “Autoplay” near the top of the page, and you can easily choose to turn it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="s2hC3K"&gt;Desktop browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2ulnnQ"&gt;There are a variety of desktop browsers out there — some of which let you turn off video autoplay and some of which don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fd8uUw"&gt;Using Google Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUC60J"&gt;If you use Google Chrome and want to turn off video autoplay — you can’t. There used to be an experimental command-line flag that allowed you to turn them off (you can find the flags by typing &lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/ &lt;/em&gt;into Chrome’s address field), but it’s disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nduwAi"&gt;You can turn the sound off (which might help a bit):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2pi4WV"&gt;Tap on the three dots in the upper right corner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PoqtKL"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; “Site settings” &amp;gt; “Sound”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O2qcvH"&gt;Toggle sound off. You can add exceptions for specific sites here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w8Y2Gv"&gt;Using Microsoft Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0DLaQY"&gt;Interestingly, Microsoft’s Edge browser, which is also based on the Chromium open-source design, does let you turn off — well, at least, limit — video autoplay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LsUVdG"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qm9766"&gt;In the left-hand column, click on “Site Permissions,” and then scroll down to and select “Media autoplay.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MZkweK"&gt;You can either allow audio and video to play automatically or limit it. According to the instructions, whether autoplay will work or not will depend on “how you’ve visited the page and whether you interacted with media in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ORXOug"&gt;Using Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ollGg5"&gt;Firefox has a similar feature that lets you turn off autoplay, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hH6zPX"&gt;Click on the three lines in the upper right corner of the browser and select “Preferences.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ScAS4n"&gt;In the left-hand column, click on “Privacy &amp;amp; Security.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VpdtZu"&gt;Scroll down to the section headed “Permissions” and look for “Autoplay.” Click on the button marked “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UWaPPt"&gt;A drop-down menu will let you allow audio and video, block audio, or block audio and video. You can also specify sites that you want to differ from your defaults — for example, if you block audio and video as a default, but you want to allow it for, say, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6PVRmy"&gt;Using Safari&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7V7uVV"&gt;Safari makes it simple to disable autoplay. In fact, it assumes that you want the feature disabled to begin with. However, if it hasn’t been disabled — or if you want to make some exceptions to the rule — here’s what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="d4voTR"&gt;While in the app, go to Safari &amp;gt; Preferences in the top menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WgE7hB"&gt;Click on “Websites” in the top menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lvET2R"&gt;Look for and select “Auto-Play” in the side menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sCiOqH"&gt;Look for the drop-down menu at the bottom right of the window and select “Never Auto-Play.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="y1GAVn"&gt;As with Firefox, you can whitelist any sites that you want to be an exception to the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reuters finally decides to charge you for its online news stories with a paywall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Reuters logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gb7sYeEeJOyQHCqDoL2ukllD-W0=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69133132/1157654467.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQKNI8"&gt;As online publishers grapple with how to replace dwindling ad revenue and find new ways to bring in money, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, one of the largest news organizations in the world, is using a strategy that’s been around for years and putting its online content behind a paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBNpzP"&gt;Reuters.com draws 41 million unique visitors monthly, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/reuters-website-goes-behind-paywall-new-strategy-2021-04-15/"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, but it has not charged for access like other news sites in its business-centric niche have done for some time. It will let users read five stories a month for free and plans to charge $34.99 a month for a subscription. That’s a bit pricier than a sub to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; ($18.42 / month) but closer to similar news organizations of its type, including &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; ($38.99 / month), which put its paywall up in 1996, and Bloomberg.com ($34.99 / month), which added a paywall in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Xwz5z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; said it generates half of its revenue from its largest client, the financial data firm Refinitiv, and also makes money from online advertising. The company says it has redesigned its website with a “professional audience” in mind and plans investment in segments like legal news and live streams of its events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuIC5A"&gt;How online news is paid for has been the topic of discussion among publishers for years; online advertising doesn’t bring in the level of revenue that print ads used to for newspapers, and publishers often have to rely on platforms like Facebook and Google to push their content to readers. Google has battled with lawmakers in Australia who want the search giant to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;pay publishers for their content&lt;/a&gt;. And amid renewed scrutiny of social media platforms and how they siphon ad revenue from news publishers, a bill &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bill-aid-us-publishers-google-facebook-rises-76605745"&gt;introduced last month in Congress&lt;/a&gt; aims to give more leverage to publishers when negotiating with platforms for a share of ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5nggI"&gt;While both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276544/google-news-showcase-uk-argentina-launch-license-paywall-content"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have initiatives that pay some publishers to license their content, for many news outlets online subscriptions are a major part of their revenue streams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWXdkd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
