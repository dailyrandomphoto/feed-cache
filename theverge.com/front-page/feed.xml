    <title>The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fi4TH7"&gt;One of tech’s biggest problems in the past few months has been due to one of its smallest components: chips. Months into the shortage, the effects have spread far beyond the difficulty of buying an Xbox Series X or PS5. Car companies are being hit the worst, and even &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;home appliances&lt;/a&gt; might start to see issues with supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oliYeU"&gt;Earlier this year, companies expected to have supply chains sorted and products more consistently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;back on shelves by summer&lt;/a&gt; — but June is nearly over and there’s seemingly no end in sight. And with the upcoming slate of big tech releases and the holiday shopping season coming up, expect things to get worse before they get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8jotJ"&gt;“We had thought probably six or seven months ago, like everybody else, that it would be relatively short-term.” Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere, commented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;on The Verge’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “But I think we’re into this for the next 12 to 18 months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmSk8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chips could be in short supply for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSWfIj"&gt;It’s not just tractors and trucks, though. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger voiced similar sentiment, commenting in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-earnings-first-quarter-2021-11619043954"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; back in April that it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. “This will take a while until people can put more capacity in the ground.” And AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;noted at a May investor event&lt;/a&gt; that the company was being forced to prioritize its higher end chips over lower-powered parts due to shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpT1Lt"&gt;There’s two different forces at work here. For some products, there’s too much demand, which impacts the higher-end chips like the GPUs in a PlayStation 5 or an RTX 3080 graphics card. While chip shortages have undoubtedly played a part, there’s also simply more people who want to buy these products than there are enough to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Jm2S"&gt;Take the PS5, for instance, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-17-ps5-the-fastest-selling-console-in-us-history"&gt;fastest selling console in US history&lt;/a&gt; despite the continued difficulty in purchasing one months after its launch. “Even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,” Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a private analyst briefing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/sony-warns-tight-playstation-5-supply-to-extend-into-next-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoP3av"&gt;Or take GPUs, which have &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3138130/bitcoin-crackdown-sends-graphics-cards-prices-plummeting-china-after"&gt;finally started to drop in price&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks — not because Nvidia has magically figured out how to churn out more parts, but because demand is finally slowing down following plummeting Bitcoin prices and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSuly"&gt;It’s in chipmakers’ interests to keep trying to churn out those parts: newer chips are more lucrative. If you’re TSMC or Samsung, it’s in your best interest to focus on making (and expanding) those production efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZ0U0H"&gt;On the flip side, though, are supply issues, particularly for older chip designs. Unlike a new iPhone or Xbox, a Ford truck or a John Deere tractor doesn’t need bleeding-edge chips using TSMC or Samsung’s 5nm process. They use older chips, which are less powerful (and less pricey) than ones using brand new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDuK9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Older chips — like the ones used in cars — are being hit particularly hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUeMSE"&gt;The impact here is already being felt. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features?srnd=premium-europe&amp;amp;amp;sref=ctSjKj2N"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from last month notes that carmakers are starting to skip out on offering premium features like navigation systems or extra screens in order to stretch their supply of chips further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia repurposed old GPUs&lt;/a&gt; into special cryptocurrency mining boards to free up more supply of newer ones for gamers. Even Apple noted that it was running into trouble getting ahold of those older chips, due to the extra competition. “Most of our issue is on licensing those legacy nodes, there are many different people not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,” Cook said in Apple’s Q2 earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLy76S"&gt;Revathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex — the world’s third largest electronics manufacturing company — noted a similar issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451309/flex-revathi-advaithi-interview-decoder-manufacturing-covid-19"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “Automotive semiconductors have been pretty outdated,” she explains, noting that automakers either have to invest in upgrading to newer technologies more on par with consumer devices, or foundries need to build out more capacity for those specific legacy chips — parts which aren’t really useful for phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWVuHy"&gt;Exacerbating the issue is that on a broader scale, the semiconductor industry has become increasingly consolidated. Despite the increasing importance of computer chips in virtually every hardware product across multiple industries, the number of companies that make those chips — especially specialized chips at the high end of the market — have grown increasingly fewer in number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsR2Az"&gt;TSMC alone accounts for 92 percent of the supply of cutting-edge chips, with Samsung providing the rest, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;according to a&lt;em&gt; Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reportedly makes about 60 percent of the chips for car manufacturers around the world. Which means that when those companies run out of capacity, there’s not a lot of other places to go to get those processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyl6s4"&gt;That’s also why chip shortages likely won’t hit some of the biggest devices, like Apple’s next iPhone or whatever Samsung’s fall flagship ends up being, at least not as hard as they hit Ford trucks or GPUs. &lt;a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210621PD212.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitimes&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that TSMC is already &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;prioritizing Apple’s orders&lt;/a&gt; (along with those of car manufacturers) heading into the fall. Because of the size and scale of Apple’s orders — think of how many iPhones it sells every year, all using cutting-edge chips from TSMC — it has the pull to stay at the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04dBvl"&gt;The bad news is that the crunch will probably get worse before it gets better. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are all heavily investing in expanding and building new fabs. The Biden administration is also trying to help, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;pushing to pump billions into US semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;. But as Intel’s CEO noted, it’ll take months, if not a few years, for those investments to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JkcgD"&gt;And with the holiday season fast approaching and a new wave of products from across market segments all fighting for chips, there’s almost certainly bound to be more product delays, cut corners, price jumps, and part shortages to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpfiyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCUXRt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John McAfee found dead in Barcelona prison, authorities say</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zlm5ym"&gt;John McAfee, founder of the company behind McAfee Antivirus, has been found dead according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/john-mcafee-found-dead-prison-after-spanish-court-allows-extradition-2021-06-23/"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2021/06/23/60d38594e4d4d8c47b8b4699.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Mundo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://elpais.com/economia/2021-06-23/el-fundador-del-antivirus-mcafee-john-mcafee-se-suicida-en-una-prision-de-barcelona.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El País&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and others. He was being held in a Barcelona prison, and the Catalan Department of Justice has stated that his death was likely caused by suicide. Lawyers for McAfee confirmed his death to &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/business/john-mcafee-dead.html"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with one saying&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it was “the result of a cruel system that had no reason to keep this man in jail for so long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XcpY7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXvvlL"&gt;McAfee was being held in prison, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion"&gt;pending extradition to the US&lt;/a&gt;, since his arrest in October 2020. He faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503324/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion-sued-doj-sec"&gt;charges of tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; and had also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315494/john-mcafee-fraud-securities-scheme-charges-cryptocurrency"&gt;been charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt; relating to an alleged cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme. Spanish courts had approved his extradition this morning with opportunity for appeal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/spain-high-court-allows-john-mcafees-extradition-us-2021-06-23/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2021/06/23/60d34ebce4d4d8ca7b8b4664.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Mundo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5xhC1"&gt;McAfee’s story over the past decade has been headline-grabbing. He’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4444266/john-mcafee-youtube-how-to-uninstall-mcafee-antivirus"&gt;released a drug-fueled video&lt;/a&gt; in which he un-installs McAfee Antivirus, claimed to have made a device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786008/john-mcafee-d-central-device-avoid-nsa-private-network"&gt;that blocked NSA surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2018/06/04/john-mcafee-president-2020/"&gt;run for president&lt;/a&gt; — twice, in 2016 and 2020. He’s also a noted cryptocurrency promoter, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189880/john-mcafee-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-twitter-ico"&gt;once claimed to charge $105,000&lt;/a&gt; for each promotional tweet, if you wanted McAfee to boost your cryptocurrency or initial coin offering on Twitter’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAP7Jn"&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5282618/intel-phases-out-mcafee-brand-name-distancing-itself-from"&gt;Intel rebranded the antivirus software&lt;/a&gt; that bore McAfee’s name, changing it to “Intel Security.” In response, McAfee told the BBC that he was grateful that “the worst software on the planet” was no longer associated with his name. McAfee later sued Intel after it warned him that naming a new cybersecurity company after himself would be trademark infringement. McAfee &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mcafee-settlement/intel-john-mcafee-settle-lawsuits-over-antivirus-pioneers-name-idUSKBN19Q31Y"&gt;later agreed to a settlement with Intel&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he wouldn’t use his name in connection to any cybersecurity products or services he worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7Pm0Z"&gt;McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement. He, his family, and members of his security forces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2998762/john-mcafee-belize-police-wrongful-arrest"&gt;were arrested by the Belize police&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, after drug and firearm charges. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3734178/mcafee-arrest-murder-investigation"&gt;went on the run later that year&lt;/a&gt;, after the Belize police declared that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3636412/john-mcafee-questioning-murder-investigation-belize"&gt;was wanted for questioning&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the murder of his neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y54PJN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwv3KH"&gt;The story became one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/14/12904402/john-mcafee-rape-murder-accusations-gringo-documentary-tiff-interview"&gt;focuses of a 2016 Showtime documentary&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to prove that McAfee was involved not only in that murder, but other crimes as well. &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/john-mcafee-wont-pay-25m-judgment-in-wrongful-death-case-has-ignored-all-lawsuits-for-11-years/"&gt;As recently as 2019&lt;/a&gt;, McAfee called the case against him “frivolous,” and refused to pay a $25 million judgement against him in a wrongful death suit. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1108191328515571713"&gt;also claimed&lt;/a&gt; that he had over $200 million in judgements against him in other legal cases, but that he could not pay any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uU5bZ"&gt;In recent years, McAfee claimed to be on the run from the CIA, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1152240931015462914"&gt;tweeting a picture of himself&lt;/a&gt; on a boat holding a gun. McAfee has also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1200864283766251521"&gt;tweeted multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, once &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1316801215083225096"&gt;after his October arrest&lt;/a&gt;, that he wouldn’t kill himself, and those tweets are already leading to conspiracy theories about his death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj4Ntd"&gt;The US Department of Justice tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has no comment on the matter, referring us to Spanish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3d5OT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock is finally coming to Fire TV on June 24th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y8JWDJqnUIqQEaZ327qew25XusU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495410/peacock_channels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Peacock app displayed on a TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFl6Vy"&gt;Nearly a year after Peacock’s launch, NBCUniversal’s marquee streaming app is finally coming to Fire TV and Fire tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06dPGl"&gt;The streaming service will officially arrive on Amazon devices on June 24th, allowing users to access the app without having to sideload it. The companies announced Wednesday that the app would be supported across Fire TV products, including Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV smart TVs. A Peacock spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that second-generation Fire TVs and above will have support for the app, as will all Fire Tablets with Fire OS 5 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Anzodc"&gt;In addition to Peacock, the distribution agreement will see 15 NBCUniversal apps arrive on Amazon devices as well, including various NBC apps and Telemundo. Much of Peacock’s content is available to stream for free, but users can unlock more content and originals with either of the service’s paid tiers. Peacock’s premium ad-supported tier costs $5 per month, while its ad-free experience costs $10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37X3cT"&gt;Support for the app will give streamers access not only to NBCUniversal’s catalog of network programming — including popular series like &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&lt;/em&gt; — but also to coverage of various sporting events. These include Sunday Night Football, the Tokyo Olympics, and, because Peacock has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319438/wwe-network-peacock-features-price-faq-deal"&gt;exclusive rights&lt;/a&gt; to the WWE Network, SummerSlam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdaCbT"&gt;Previously, Fire TV users who’d hoped to access event coverage exclusive to the service would either have to find another way to stream it or sideload it themselves — something Peacock itself &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeacockTVCare/status/1374376982759108608"&gt;previously encouraged&lt;/a&gt; its frustrated users to try as a workaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYUXaZ"&gt;When support arrives tomorrow, Fire TV users will be able to open and search the service’s catalog using voice commands. The companies said that later this year, users will get further Alexa support and the ability to surf Peacock using an Alexa Voice Remote, a Fire TV Cube, or by pairing an Echo device to a Fire TV smart TV or streaming stick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jerry Seinfeld’s Pop-Tarts obsession is turning into a Netflix movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comedians In Cars w. Jerry Seinfeld &amp;amp;amp; Eddie Murphy ‑ LA Tastemaker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8FBCO64F48gR0CWxTDHR_qGxWFw=/0x0:2944x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495243/1162827726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzQ9wD"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld is perhaps best known for co-writing and starring in &lt;em&gt;Bee Movie &lt;/em&gt;(fine, also for co-creating one of the most beloved televised sitcoms). But since that daring project, he hasn’t really returned to feature-length films. That’s about to change — &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/jerry-seinfeld-netflix-movie-deal-unfrosted-creation-of-pop-tart-directing-starring-cowriter-1234780032/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/jerry-seinfeld-pop-tart-movie-netflix-unfrosted-1235003638/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report that Seinfeld is co-writing, directing, producing, and starring in &lt;em&gt;Unfrosted&lt;/em&gt;, a new film about the origins of Pop-Tarts, for Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t0WvK"&gt;Seinfeld’s fascination with the toaster pastry is well-documented, featuring the breakfast food &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmCTUBEluSE"&gt;in his stand-up&lt;/a&gt; and in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itWxXyCfW5s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;video interview&lt;/a&gt; on joke writing. Seinfeld is penning this film exploration alongside Spike Feresten and Barry Marder — two of &lt;em&gt;Bee Movie&lt;/em&gt;’s co-writers — using the classic stand-up bit as a jumping off point. Will it be a humorous spin on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14322100/founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds-ray-kroc-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Founder&lt;/em&gt;-style origin story&lt;/a&gt;? Hard to say, but clearly Seinfeld has thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zFSOZD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmCTUBEluSE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iP0CsB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfrosted&lt;/em&gt; has been shopped around for the last few days according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, but Seinfeld’s existing relationship with Netflix is what helped seal the deal. Besides featuring the comedian’s modern stand-up specials, Netflix also secured the rights to Seinfeld’s popular interview show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/17/14304790/jerry-seinfeld-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee-netflix-crackle-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&lt;/em&gt; in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and will be the go-to location for anyone looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20868736/seinfeld-netflix-2021-hulu-friends-streaming-wars"&gt;to binge old &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; episodes later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRYjO3"&gt;This is definitely another example of Netflix reinvesting in the relationships with comedy talent it’s been cultivating for the last several years (see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116858/adam-sandler-netflix-deal-four-movies-murder-mystery-most-viewed-2019"&gt;Adam Sandler’s Netflix-based streaming empire&lt;/a&gt;), but it also just seems like the kind of goofy film idea that could only get greenlit in the heady excesses of our current streaming era. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why 2021’s heat waves are so brutal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Heat Wave Continues in Southwest United States" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UgyDnE9uEU1lptXt32Edd4U7oE=/0x8:5448x3640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495165/1324130949.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - JUNE 17: A digital sign displays a temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit as a heat wave continues to bake the Southwest United States on June 17, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada. | Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dt9r8m"&gt;The US is only a few days into summer and another heat wave is already coming for the West. “Record shattering” would be an understatement to describe the last heat wave, which lingered over the Southwest last week and has since shifted eastward. Roughly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/climateguyw/status/1407411398204919809"&gt;4,000 new temperature records&lt;/a&gt; have already&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;been set this year. More are going to make the books over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bg70El"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A heat dome is a trap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pooO64"&gt;Both heat waves are caused by atmospheric conditions called heat domes. In short, a heat dome is a trap. It forms when high pressure in the upper atmosphere creates a sort of lid or cap that stops hot air from escaping, according to &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;. As the air sinks back down to Earth, it compresses and heats up even more. The heat dome also blocks out clouds and storms, which might otherwise provide some relief from the sun’s hot rays. A heat dome also leads to longer and more intense heat waves because it creates a feedback cycle, according to Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. The hotter temperatures become, the stronger the heat dome gets, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaLxI3"&gt;The heat dome that’s forecast to settle over the Pacific Northwest in the next three to seven days can also be called a “warm-core high,” according to National Weather Service forecaster David Roth. That’s a high pressure system that strengthens with height. The June record high for the state of Washington is 113 degrees Fahrenheit, which Roth says will probably be “threatened.” It’s unusual&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that this heat dome is forming so far north, where temperatures don’t normally get nearly as high as they are forecast to reach in the coming days. The average high temperature in Seattle around this time of year is 74 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPqBBx"&gt;That makes this heat dome particularly dangerous for communities that aren’t built for the heat. “You get acclimated to warm in the summer, but that’s only if you’re used to experiencing those conditions. This could be very unlike any other heatwave they’ve experienced,” Roth says. “So yeah, you would worry more about heat exhaustion, heat stroke, that sort of thing. Everyone’s going to need to stay in air-conditioned places and keep hydrated.” Unfortunately&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;only a third of homes in the Seattle area have air conditioning, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-is-least-air-conditioned-metro-area-in-the-u-s-census-data-show-so-how-do-locals-keep-cool/"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gZktOo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This could be very unlike any other heatwave they’ve experienced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHYTYk"&gt;The conditions driving this heat wave could persist until the end of next week, Roth says. It’s also expected to expand eastward toward Idaho and Montana, and southward into California &lt;a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php"&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;. Lewiston, Idaho is forecast to reach 112 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, four degrees above its daily record set in 1881. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVhnYZ"&gt;Heat domes are also bad news when it comes to drought and wildfires. They’re often related to drought because they direct storm systems away from the region, according Hayhoe. The West is already in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545107/satellite-images-california-drought-water-esa"&gt;epically bad drought&lt;/a&gt; that is drying up reservoirs and forcing farmers to abandon crops. Hot, dry conditions across the Western US are already turning forests and other ecosystems into tinder boxes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;early in the fire season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="cRKpoQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qMsHGF"&gt;While the fever the US is running might feel unusual now, it could be part of a new normal driven by climate change. Higher global average temperatures are making heat waves and droughts more frequent and intense, while the fire season is growing longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="riD4Ip"&gt;“It’s as if we always have a chance of rolling a double six — so that’s an exceptional heatwave. But as climate changes, it’s sneaking more sixes onto our dice,” Hayhoe tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Climate change is also sneaking some sevens onto our dice. So not only are we getting more of these, but we’re also seeing that they’re getting stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRYitd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We regret to inform you that T-Mobile is selling a 5G-branded gin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LCOhGBVo2e8RQPnT2cd8PGEkZNk=/0x160:3833x2715/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494965/5gin_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile’s 5G-branded gin and ginger beer go on sale tomorrow.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCFBBq"&gt;Whatever the reason, 5G-themed gin is now something that exists in the world, courtesy of T-Mobile. Ostensibly, “Ultra Capacity 5Gin” exists to celebrate a T-Mobile milestone: covering 300 million people with its low-band extended range 5G network and 150 million covered by its better midrange ultra capacity 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJtDl0"&gt;But maybe it just came down to the company seeing Ryan Reynolds having a good time, selling gin*, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982199/ryan-reynolds-mint-mnvo-t-mobile-ownership-deadpool-detective-pikachu"&gt;enjoying ownership of a wireless company&lt;/a&gt; and it thinking, “Let’s get in on that.” Or perhaps as the Mariners were &lt;a href="https://www.lookoutlanding.com/2021/5/18/22443250/tigers-make-justin-dunn-look-good-mariners-make-spencer-turnbull-historic"&gt;on the receiving end of yet another no-hitter&lt;/a&gt;, some marketing execs out for a night at ol’ T-Mobile Park drowned their sorrows in one too many $20 G&amp;amp;Ts and got to thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Yo9VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With notes of pine, citrus, and unfulfilled Sprint acquisition promises&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Giq2mj"&gt;The corporate-branded gin nobody asked for is &lt;a href="https://heritagedistilling.com/"&gt;produced by Heritage Distilling&lt;/a&gt;, the Northwest’s preferred purveyor of flavored vodkas and Seahawks-themed whiskey. There’s a non-alcoholic option, too: Extended Range 5Ginger Beer, made by Jones Soda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPyy9h"&gt;If this sounds appealing and your home bar would benefit from a gin with “approachable piney notes” and a label with loud magenta branding, then you can &lt;a href="https://t-mobile5gin.com/"&gt;order a bottle for $30 starting tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;. The ginger beer also goes on sale tomorrow at $10 for a six-pack. Just do us a favor if you order some: maybe pour one out for that fourth wireless carrier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;T-Mobile was supposed to help set up&lt;/a&gt; after the Sprint merger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfunIO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Technically, Ryan Reynolds &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.diageo.com/en/news-and-media/features/diageo-to-acquire-aviation-gin-and-davos-brands/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sold his gin company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $610 million last August. Spiritually, he’s still kicking around as part-owner, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA continues to spend big on mobile games with $1.4 billion Playdemic acquisition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irn2xXyAD4JZUlFd1SuiM4zWFPI=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494935/970613582.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJtKBV"&gt;EA is adding to its roster of mobile game developers &lt;a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Acquires-Playdemic-Makers-of-the-Highly-Successful-Golf-Clash-Mobile-Game-From-Warner-Bros.-Games-and-ATT/default.aspx"&gt;by purchasing Playdemic&lt;/a&gt;, known for &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;, from WarnerMedia for $1.4 billion. The company says it plans on using Playdemic’s experience to help make future mobile games and that it’s interested in using &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt;’s mechanics with other franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJ25s3"&gt;It’s possible that EA could be purchasing Playdemic not only to gain ownership of a successful mobile game (&lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; has over 10 million installs &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdemic.golf.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;), but because there’s opportunity for EA to incorporate some of its other series — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22440408/ea-sports-pga-tour-release-date-course-list-majors"&gt;it makes the PGA golf games&lt;/a&gt; after all, which could tie in well with a mobile golf game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGbdXX"&gt;EA seems to be focusing on mobile gaming recently — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;also purchased mobile developer Glu&lt;/a&gt; in February for $2.1 billion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tz28y"&gt;WarnerMedia, Playdemic’s former owner, is currently going through a transition, as it’s being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444031/warnermedia-discovery-merger-hbo-max-streaming-giant"&gt;spun out from under AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; to join with Discovery. &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/electronic_arts.html"&gt;The company says&lt;/a&gt; that it’s divesting from Playdemic as “part of [its] overall strategy to build games based on Warner Bros. storied franchises.” Indeed, if you go to &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbrosgames.com/games"&gt;Warner Bros. Games’ website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s dominated by franchises like Lego, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat (with &lt;em&gt;Scribblenauts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Golf Clash&lt;/em&gt; being the only real exceptions). It also has upcoming games like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340247/gotham-knights-delay-release-date-2022"&gt;DC universe-based &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia says the rest of its games will become part of the combined Warner-Discovery company after the deal is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nHEWk"&gt;Mobile gaming has become a big focus for companies as the market has exploded. EA competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision purchased &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;-maker King&lt;/a&gt; for $5.9 billion in 2015, and its &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/af35383a-0db9-44de-b0b2-180eac785930"&gt;recent earnings&lt;/a&gt; show that the division is now bringing in more money than Blizzard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22458279/valorant-mobile-spinoff-riot-games"&gt;Many popular PC and console games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, and EA’s own &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; have also gotten mobile ports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alien planets have had ‘front-row’ view of Earth for ages, astronomers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JUdFAwa9B5882whTM-fnxKq1QGc=/0x43:3600x2443/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494911/ssc2017_01d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration showing the seven Earth-like planets of Trappist-1, a nearby star system astronomers say will be able to view Earth in transit roughly 1,600 years from now.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL-Caltech / R. Hurt (IPAC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="byTdFl"&gt;For decades, astronomers have probed the universe for signs of life by watching distant planets glide past their host stars, studying the tiny dips of starlight that give away clues about an exoplanet’s atmosphere. Hundreds of those worlds could bear life. And if there’s life, what’s to say it isn’t looking back at us? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1ng06"&gt;New research published Wednesday entertains that question, finding nearly 2,000 star systems that have had a front-row seat to observe Earth in recent millennia. The study suggests that hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations in those star systems could’ve been in the right position to watch Earth transit our Sun and look at us the same way we attempt to look at other planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EoTU4n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cosmos is dynamic, so the vantage point is not forever — it is gained and lost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbVq4b"&gt;A total of 1,715 stars within a range of 326 light-years have been in the right place to spot life on Earth, either currently or sometime around the wee ages of human civilization roughly 5,000 years ago, astronomers from Cornell University and the American Museum of Natural History wrote in a paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday. The paper, relying on a recently released trove of data on distant stars detected by the European Space Agency’s Gaia spacecraft, indicates 1,402 of those systems can currently see Earth from a finite perspective called the Earth Transit Zone (ETZ). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t3vJw5"&gt;“I started to wonder what stars could see us if we change the vantage point... The cosmos is dynamic, so the vantage point is not forever — it is gained and lost,” Lisa Kaltenegger, an associate professor of astronomy at Cornell and a co-author of the paper, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And I was wondering how long that front row seat to find Earth through the dip in brightness of the star lasts. No one knew.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEZ2tA"&gt;Witnessing distant planets move around their star is among the primary techniques astronomers use to observe exoplanets. They watch for a “transit” — when an exoplanet’s orbit takes it between its star and Earth — dimming the star’s light ever so slightly. The idea behind the Earth Transit Zone retools that technique to imagine Earth itself as the exoplanet. As star systems swirl around the center of our galaxy, many fall into the position from which Earth’s silhouette can be seen crossing in front of our Sun, just like astronomers see exoplanets “transit” their own stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IC6j9n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hypothetical aliens “could have identified Earth as a habitable, or even as a living, world long ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyvPtv"&gt;In recent decades, scientists have put themselves in the shoes of imaginary alien astronomers to get a sense of how detectable we are in the universe, a unique “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00776.pdf"&gt;reciprocal&lt;/a&gt;” perspective in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Some of those studies looked at star systems — many confirmed as exoplanet hosts — that are presently positioned to spot Earth. “If any of these planets host intelligent observers, they could have identified Earth as a habitable, or even as a living, world long ago, and we could be receiving their broadcasts today,” researchers wrote in a separate study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Astrobiology&lt;/em&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTk5tF"&gt;But Kaltenegger and Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist and senior scientist at the American Museum of Natural History, looked backward and forward in time. They found that 313 star systems were previously in the right spot to see Earth photobomb the Sun in the last 5,000 years. Ross 128 b, an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting one of the closest stars to our Solar System, was in the right spot to see Earth for over two millennia ending at least 900 years ago. Exoplanets in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/22/14674088/7-planet-solar-system-discovered-conditions-for-life-water-nature-nasa"&gt;Trappist-1 solar system&lt;/a&gt;, some 39 light-years away, will be able to see our planet 1,642 years from now. And some exoplanets farther away have been in the ETZ for thousands of years and will remain for thousands more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="742enW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10620891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0S0qOb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; anyone was living on these exoplanets and &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; that life had mustered the same technology humans currently have, they could have already found Earth. It’s a lot of “ifs” and assumptions, but given the course of human development, we know that it’s at least possible. “Although we cannot infer the time needed for life to start on any exoplanet from Earth’s history, the early signs for life on Earth are encouraging,” Kaltenegger and Faherty’s report says. The star systems closest to Earth generally spend over 1,000 years in the ETZ, the paper says, leaving open “a long timeline for nominal civilizations to identify Earth as an interesting planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGep6T"&gt;Human-made radio waves that started pinging from Earth roughly 100 years ago have washed over about 75 different star systems, the paper says. Forty-six of those systems are also currently in the ETZ, meaning any exoplanets within those star systems probably offer the best seat in the cosmic theater for detecting life on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESdrl7"&gt;Meanwhile, humanity is continuing its own exploration of our neighborhood. Projects using the James Webb Space Telescope, a multibillion-dollar observatory now slated to launch to space by the end of the year, will be able to get a closer look at these nearby celestial bodies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE0GBh"&gt;“We don’t know yet how likely it is to have life on planets or how likely it is that curious technological civilizations evolve from there,” Kaltenegger says. “We don’t know at all if there is life out there in the cosmos, but we are on the verge of finding out.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>To succeed, cloud gaming needs to disappear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/raAhioVoGdFOS7XHGNSzKw87w08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494837/acastro_190618_1777_cloud_gaming_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The problem with cloud gaming is you have to think about it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EsSyjB"&gt;Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more: none of these are cloud gaming’s final form. They had one spectacular window of opportunity to pitch themselves as the next generation of gaming ahead of the PS5 and Xbox Series X, but we’ve yet to see any sign that they’ve made a significant dent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="1IwYtb"&gt;I think it’s because there’s too much friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyHdnm"&gt;Before you buy a $60 game for a cloud gaming platform or sign up for a recurring subscription, you might ask yourself: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JJwFhK"&gt;Will cloud gaming even work for me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ghKVbh"&gt;What if my connection isn’t good enough? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DDWXL4"&gt;What if my home networking gear isn’t good enough?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BG3fOJ"&gt;What if I live too far away from the servers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aHjpFf"&gt;Will this cloud service actually have the games I want to play?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ik0La7"&gt;Will there be enough of them to justify a monthly fee?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hvkmO7"&gt;Will developers bother to port games over?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IuRiZC"&gt;Will they run as well as they would if I just bought a console or PC?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DYb4iI"&gt;Will I need a special controller or dongle to play on TV?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lMI5BA"&gt;Will I go over my data cap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mVJVIo"&gt;Will I be able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21252200/google-stadia-cross-play-games-lonely-venue"&gt;play with my friends&lt;/a&gt; who aren’t on this particular cloud platform?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QOaTzG"&gt;Will I lose access to my games entirely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133793/nvidia-geforce-now-no-more-activision-blizzard-games-carriage"&gt;if they lose a distribution deal&lt;/a&gt; or shut down the servers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LhxnHN"&gt;Will I have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336600/nvidia-geforce-now-price-tier-cloud-gaming-subscription"&gt;wait in line to play my games&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bIV9lw"&gt;Can I access my existing save files?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vAcbDl"&gt;What about outages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gp0FQk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;Are they hiding&lt;/a&gt; how well these games will run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3JYdIN"&gt;What if this tech company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;suddenly decides&lt;/a&gt; it no longer wants to be a gaming company, or &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/30/shadow-game-streaming-bankruptcy/"&gt;goes bankrupt&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yvIEbI"&gt;That’s a lot of uncertainty! But it doesn’t need to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCfU65"&gt;The reason these answers matter is because today’s companies are generally asking you to choose. Is &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;where I want to play my games? Should I invest my money in the cloud? It’s a little ridiculous, because the whole point of the cloud is that you can play anywhere at all. You don’t worry about where you’re going to watch your next Netflix movie or YouTube video, do you? You just tap and watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="icWCCo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maybe the Netflix of games should actually be like Netflix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zpq7jR"&gt;Someday, with the right business model, that may be how cloud gaming will work as well. You’ll be paying for the content, not the locale. You’ll simply sign up for a Netflix-like subscription filled with games that run on every platform under the sun, and their quality will dynamically adjust to the amount of horsepower you can access at any given moment — much like how the quality of your Netflix stream automatically adjusts when the rest of your household starts hogging the bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTVuyu"&gt;Sure, games won’t feel &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as good on a phone as with the latest console or gaming PC, but you won’t have to think about whether “local” is better than “cloud.” You’ll get both, perhaps even simultaneously, once companies figure the economics out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz2i5j"&gt;Games are already starting to work this way. Dynamic frame rates and resolution targets are common on major console and PC games, automatically adjusting a game’s graphics to keep the action smooth. Meanwhile, Microsoft is championing the idea that one copy of a game might be good enough to play across a console, PC, and cloud. Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060771/microsoft-xbox-series-x-exclusive-games-launch-backwards-compatibility"&gt;Xbox Play Anywhere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150594/microsoft-xbox-series-x-backwards-compatibility-support-smart-delivery"&gt;Smart Delivery&lt;/a&gt; initiatives give you digital copies of the latest Microsoft-exclusive games for your Xbox, Windows PC, and cloud for one monthly subscription, often bringing your saves along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2ozNq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"},{"title":"Xbox boss says Microsoft’s Bethesda deal was all about exclusive games for Game Pass","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325757/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-acquisition-game-pass-exclusive-games-phil-spencer-comment"},{"title":"A first look at Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS and the web","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"},{"title":"Microsoft announces Xbox TV app and its own xCloud streaming stick","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud"},{"title":"Microsoft will build native Xbox games for the cloud, and the woman behind Portal will lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544018/microsoft-xbox-hire-portal-developer-kim-swift-cloud-native-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv4Ype"&gt;When you launch that next game on your Microsoft Xbox One, you might only get the limited power of that last-gen game console — but switch to an Xbox Series X and you’ll see sharper graphics and higher frame rates (assuming its developers have issued a next-gen patch). You can get even more with a powerful Windows gaming rig. Games&lt;em&gt; scale &lt;/em&gt;to different hardware, just like they have across multiple generations of PC graphics cards for the past two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcG1xZ"&gt;Cloud gaming can scale, too. Microsoft has announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-games-on-xbox-one-xcloud-streaming"&gt;older Xboxes like the Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X will get xCloud as well&lt;/a&gt;, letting those boxes tap into an Xbox Series X-grade server to play next-gen games like &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a little like sticking a more powerful GPU into your machine. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544018/microsoft-xbox-hire-portal-developer-kim-swift-cloud-native-games"&gt;Microsoft is also now pursuing native cloud games&lt;/a&gt; that could theoretically harness the power of multiple Xboxes simultaneously, unlocking experiences that might be impossible without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RFTii"&gt;But cloud gaming could let games scale to your &lt;em&gt;situation&lt;/em&gt; as well, a little like that auto-adjusting Netflix quality I mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYu3Gb"&gt;You might find this amusing: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452029/apple-microsoft-xbox-console-streaming-xcloud-app-store-guidelines"&gt;Apple’s App Store rules&lt;/a&gt; currently let you stream games from your own Xbox on your own local network to your iPhone with a dedicated iOS app — but it won’t let you do the exact same thing over the internet from Microsoft’s Xboxes sitting in server racks. Either way, you’re remotely controlling an Xbox over a Wi-Fi connection through the magic window of your phone, playing your games with your Microsoft account, yet Apple doesn’t treat them the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4feiBs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This week, I dissected Apple's new rules that supposedly allow Microsoft xCloud and Google Stadia onto the the App Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spoiler alert: they don't. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LbdEBAZdBN"&gt;https://t.co/LbdEBAZdBN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1307040255879442432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9lQYVR"&gt;But Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304762/microsoft-xcloud-app-windows-xbox-touch-controls-gyro-support"&gt;quietly working on a single app that does both&lt;/a&gt;, and it makes a lot of sense. If your phone had the choice of connecting to an Xbox Series X sitting in a server rack, or an Xbox Series X sitting in your house, why wouldn’t that app automatically pick the most powerful and reliable computer to stream those games? Why not stream from your gaming PC as well? Microsoft has let us stream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/24/20813677/xbox-one-games-streaming-pc-windows-10-how-to"&gt;from Xboxes to Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt; for years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448979/microsoft-new-xbox-app-mobile-android-remote-play-beta"&gt;added local Xbox streaming to phones&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s technically a way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20871130/microsoft-xbox-one-pc-wireless-display-app-stream-games-how-to"&gt;to stream from Windows to Xbox, too&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re currently all separate ideas inside separate apps instead of one intelligent auto-switching whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwdniE"&gt;That kind of dynamic switching could theoretically help the latency problem, too. Lag is a common reason some gamers reject cloud services, claiming they don’t feel as responsive as pressing a button on a console at home. (That’s often true.) But Amazon started figuring out a way to solve that problem seven years ago: &lt;em&gt;hybrid&lt;/em&gt; cloud games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvXihl"&gt;In 2014, Amazon prototyped a tower defense game called &lt;em&gt;The Unmaking&lt;/em&gt; that could generate gigantic &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings-&lt;/em&gt;esque armies thanks to the cloud — while still letting you quickly and responsively aim a ballista using an Amazon Fire tablet’s local processing power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="h3qGCm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGCS45s-2-o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TRBj5W"&gt;Microsoft knows about hybrid games, too. The company’s &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; can offer stunning photorealistic scenery as you fly around the globe, because much of that data doesn’t live on your PC at all; it takes up 2 petabytes of storage in the cloud. And importantly, you can still play the game without that data; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/B9jTKrQA4O0?t=225"&gt;it just doesn’t look as good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdk4Us"&gt;When I fire up a future &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; on my phone, I expect it’ll be a full copy of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, one that looks and plays like &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; but at drastically reduced quality — until I’m within reach of my Xbox, my Windows computer, or a fast and reliable connection to the cloud. Then, it’ll continue to play like &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;but &lt;/em&gt;with a seamless upgrade to next-gen graphics and the ability to pick up and play on another screen right where I left off. (That last bit is something Google Stadia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;already does&lt;/a&gt; quite well.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGsZ7P"&gt;I predict that the company which eventually sells me on cloud gaming won’t be selling me on cloud gaming at all. It’ll just be selling me the games I would have bought anyhow, with the added ability to play them wherever I want and with all of my friends, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417560/sony-ps4-cross-play-confidential-documents-epic-games-agreements"&gt;assuming Sony plays ball&lt;/a&gt;. The trick is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;making sure you have those games on board&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s where big platform holders like Microsoft have an advantage — they can bake those streaming rights into the agreements developers sign to appear on console. That’s something Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415712/microsoft-xbox-store-cut-epic-games-court-documents"&gt;was planning to do&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22424596/epic-games-store-sony-playstation-pc-games-steam-competition"&gt;have already started doing&lt;/a&gt;, and something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952028/steam-valve-code-stadia-xcloud-cloud-gaming-service-competitor-streaming"&gt;we may have spotted Valve doing&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kC5pgkmB_zy_B9EOhJdfUxPPRgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506605/Cuj9cpe.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has apparently been requiring xCloud support, according to documents unearthed during the &lt;/em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;em&gt; trial.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8t5oh"&gt;It’s not the only path forward for cloud gaming, though. Another way to sell gamers cloud gaming (without trying to sell them &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; cloud gaming) is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;the way Sony-owned Gaikai originally did&lt;/a&gt;: you use the cloud to provide free game demos you can instantly play in your browser the moment you click an ad, with an option to buy the game or pay for more time when you’re done. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527461/xbox-xcloud-game-streaming-try-before-download-feature"&gt;has teased “try before you download”&lt;/a&gt; as a feature of xCloud as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6Qlrd"&gt;I also wonder if someday, some daring developer will release a cloud game without telling anyone it’s actually running on the cloud, later to reveal you’ve been playing on servers all along. It’s not currently feasible in the United States due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"&gt;the tyranny of illegitimate internet data caps&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps somewhere else. It’d be a PR stunt for the ages, and perhaps it could convince the world once and for all that this tech actually works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XNVVjx"&gt;The day someone can pull that off, you’ll know cloud gaming’s time has truly come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPFM9q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTTCtk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hospitals are selling treasure troves of medical data — what could go wrong?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RwUCTGJXR_MF4Sw7XwxVC48sa4k=/0x0:2130x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69494737/VRG_ILLO_1777_AK_body_data.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ana Kova&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xz8J6t"&gt;Healthcare organizations and hospitals in the United States all sit on treasure troves: a stockpile of patient health data stored as electronic medical records. Those files show what people are sick with, how they were treated, and what happened next. Taken together, they’re hugely valuable resources for medical discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FOyPw"&gt;Because of certain provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), healthcare organizations are able to put that treasure trove to work. As long as they de-identify the records — removing information like patient names, locations, and phone numbers — they can give or sell the data to partners for research. They don’t need to get consent from patients to do it or even tell them about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYkyWg"&gt;More and more healthcare groups are taking advantage of those partnerships. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, is working with startups to &lt;a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/04/mayo-clinic-launches-two-joint-ventures-to-build-commercialize-diagnostic-ai-tools/"&gt;develop algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to diagnose and manage conditions based on health data. Fourteen US health systems &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/17/truveta-patient-data-terry-myerson/"&gt;formed a company&lt;/a&gt; to aggregate and sell de-identified data earlier this year. The healthcare company HCA announced a new data deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454817/google-hca-patient-data-healthcare-algorithms"&gt;with Google&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68XbIP"&gt;There may be benefits to sharing this data — researchers can learn what types of treatments are best for people with certain medical conditions and develop tools to improve care. But there are risks to free-flowing data, says Eric Perakslis, chief science and digital officer at the Duke Clinical Research Institute. He outlined the ways the system could potentially harm patients in a recent &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2102616"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; with Kenneth Mandl, director of the computational health informatics program at Boston Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rdlCFU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t always understand the risks that come with the benefits until later”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ayIyoa"&gt;“I’m a huge advocate for open data,” Perakslis says. “I think it’s very easy to get excited about the benefits. What we know with medical sciences, though, is that you don’t always understand the risks that come with the benefits until later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OSqmt"&gt;Perakslis talked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about what could go wrong and how to protect people from those risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AqaEH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrdOHa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did healthcare organizations start taking advantage of their electronic medical records data in this way? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8j66S"&gt;I want to say it was probably in 2017 or 2018. The thing that really pushed this into overdrive was the rise of privacy-preserving record linkage, which combines records from the same person without identifying them. The technologies are perfectly fine. But it almost makes a lot of people feel like, “Well, if I de-identified the data, I can almost do anything I want.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQfToJ"&gt;Before those technologies, the only good way to do de-identification was to have a statistician do it. These technologies made it so almost anyone could do it. They’re not expensive. So the technology is ubiquitous, and it’s very easy to make deals and start marketing the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnH2II"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is using this data, and what’s it being used for? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yqhd3"&gt;If you look at ethical research, there are a lot of academic medical centers with great de-identified data sets and large research networks that have been well-monitored and well-designed. What’s happened beyond that is a place like an MRI center or a pharmacy has an agreement with a hospital, but that agreement doesn’t prohibit them from doing anything with that data. If you haven’t explicitly told them they can’t de-identify and sell data, they can. That’s the kind of thing we’d call a data leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcOBAH"&gt;So then there are these large data networks that are being formed, where people are putting their data in with other people’s, and then those big networks are trying to sell to pharma or government research labs or places like that. At the end of the day, everyone’s trying to sell to pharma because it’s so lucrative. In fairness, the pharma companies aren’t necessarily looking to do anything less than anything completely ethical, as far as getting data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzAHtk"&gt;I think most healthcare institutions are interested in using data for profit and for research. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that if you can actually say how you’re returning the benefit back to the core mission of the place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVq952"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So say I have my health record at a hospital that then decides to sell it to a private company that’s building a health database. It’s de-identified, so my name isn’t on it. In what ways does that put me at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bcIte"&gt;I’ve always kind of called de-identification a privacy placebo. It works about as well as the thermostat in a hotel room. There’s a lot of ways around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kALccq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always kind of called de-identification a privacy placebo.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sf81ig"&gt;If it’s re-identified and the data is hacked or exposed, there are a few things that could go on. A lot of people will use solely medical data to make fraudulent medical claims, and then what happens is the victim of the identity theft gets all these bills. Your medical record contains financial information, so there’s the financial risk of that. The other thing that can go on is if you had a condition that you didn’t want your family to know about, or your employer or something like that, it could be exposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ci04is"&gt;We’ve gotten really good at not fixing anything when this happens. Once the data is out, it’s out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUtS7s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those are the risks. But what are the benefits? How well can data from health records actually be used to solve health problems?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUNtfr"&gt;The usefulness of it is absolutely overblown. I think that, at the end of the day, electronic health records have been shown to be pretty good billing systems. While there’s great research done on them, that doesn’t mean the research is easy. It just means more people have taken it on. Good research requires really skilled people to do it. It’s really easy to underestimate the complexity of the problem. I get people calling me all the time with big studies, wondering why we couldn’t just do it using electronic health records data. We can do a lot of research that way, but it isn’t always high-quality research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTu9Z6"&gt;I think there are benefits, it just matters where you’re looking. There are great open-source data initiatives that have just really democratized the ability for smart people everywhere to get access to good-quality data for their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOF30H"&gt;I’m sure people are going to do great things. But I’ve had long conversations with people in this market, and many of them genuinely believe that what they’re doing is going to help patients. But they’re naive, and there will be gaps in their methods that will invalidate the research. It’s the “move fast, break things” mentality, which is wonderful, but please don’t move fast and break things in my daughter’s medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TCI29"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other ways to do better research that also gives patients more protection in the process? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yzn8Vh"&gt;There’s also the traditional medical research establishment that gets patients’ consent and uses the same technology in that consented way. And they get IRB approval. [&lt;em&gt;Note: Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, do ethics reviews of research that includes human subjects.&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ow646"&gt;That’s done by the government and nonprofits and also pharma. There’s great stuff out there. So I guess the question is: why do we need this whole other thing? If pharma is de-identifying and sharing data where the patients consented for research and it’s overseen by an IRB, if all of that is working, why do we need this other, risky thing? The IRB also looks at the validity of the research. Nobody’s looking at the validity of the research of this off-the-grid stuff that’s going on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icgjFi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think health institutions or regulatory agencies will adjust anything to block some of these data leaks or prevent some of the risks to patients? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2tdAR"&gt;Something like this is like any other kind of medical harm. An adverse event could be a destroyed credit score. I think there are parts of healthcare that take this very seriously, but I don’t think it’s second nature yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqB1WP"&gt;That’s partly because the game is always being upped. I think it’s very difficult to stay on the curve, especially in medicine. On one side, you have these speed-of-light tech and cybercrime processes going on, and the other is smart people trying to take care of patients better. And they’re just mismatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RUNlL"&gt;But I think the industry could help itself a little bit, and be more open, and say that they’ll do more with consent. Or [regulators] could make re-identification of data illegal. Something that actually protects the people who are going to suffer from this. I actually don’t believe there’s anything wrong with the technologies. It’s really more a matter of saying, “If we’re going to do this type of research, how do we ensure we’re protecting the people that might be harmed by it?”&lt;/p&gt;
