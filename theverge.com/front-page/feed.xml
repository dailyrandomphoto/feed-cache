    <title>Alphabet is putting its prototype robots to work cleaning up around Google’s offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urPYEqRFboI7VO3PEfNhExHalqg=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165715/google_everyday_robot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlNxPC"&gt;What does Google’s parent company Alphabet want with robots? Well, it would like them to clean up around the office, for a start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHGyJX"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/everyday-robots"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that its Everyday Robots Project — a team within its experimental X labs dedicated to creating “a general-purpose learning robot” — has moved some of its prototype machines out of the lab and into Google’s Bay Area campuses to carry out some light custodial tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="864Ve0"&gt;“We are now operating a fleet of more than 100 robot prototypes that are autonomously performing a range of useful tasks around our offices,” said Everyday Robot’s chief robot officer Hans Peter Brøndmo in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976710/alphabet-x-google-everyday-robot-project-robots-learn-sort-trash"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “The same robot that sorts trash can now be equipped with a squeegee to wipe tables and use the same gripper that grasps cups can learn to open doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7aqz6"&gt;These robots in question are essentially arms on wheels, with a multipurpose gripper on the end of a flexible arm attached to a central tower. There’s a “head” on top of the tower with cameras and sensors for machine vision and what looks like a spinning lidar unit on the side, presumably for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ys5_Do66xw9saGQCixJ4RfBLGik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027307/alphabet_every_day_robot_cleaning_offices.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Alphabet&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Alphabet’s Everyday Robot machines cleans the crumbs off a cafe table. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B76S40"&gt;As Brøndmo indicates, these bots were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976710/alphabet-x-google-everyday-robot-project-robots-learn-sort-trash"&gt;first seen sorting out recycling&lt;/a&gt; when Alphabet debuted the Everyday Robot team in 2019. The big promise that’s being made by the company (as well as by many other startups and rivals) is that machine learning will finally enable robots to operate in “unstructured” environments like homes and offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruVToD"&gt;Right now, we’re very good at building machines that can carry out repetitive jobs in a factory, but we’re stumped when trying to get them to replicate simple tasks like cleaning up a kitchen or folding laundry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwaGWy"&gt;Think about it: you may have seen robots from Boston Dynamics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;performing backflips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752389/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog-dancing-rolling-stones-start-me-up"&gt;dancing to The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;, but have you ever seen one take out the trash? It’s because getting a machine to manipulate never-before-seen objects in a novel setting (something humans do every day) is extremely difficult. This is the problem Alphabet wants to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Sh9MnxrOdcAdd5E_guwCWKSmso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027311/alphabet_robot_opening_door.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Alphabet&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit 033 makes a bid for freedom. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tOSEj0"&gt;Is it going to? Well, maybe one day — if company execs feel it’s worth burning through millions of dollars in research to achieve this goal. Certainly, though, humans are going to be cheaper and more efficient than robots for these jobs in the foreseeable future. The update today from Everyday Robot is neat, but it’s far from a leap forward. You can see from the GIFs that Alphabet shared of its robots that they’re still slow and awkward, carrying out tasks inexpertly and at a glacial pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5CFZh"&gt;However, it’s still definitely &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that the robots are being tested “in the wild” rather than in the lab. Compare Alphabet’s machines to Samsung’s Bot Handy, for example; a similar-looking tower-and-arm bot that the company showed off at CES last year, apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224649/samsung-bot-handy-care-robots-ces-2021"&gt;pouring wine and loading a dishwasher&lt;/a&gt;. At least, Bot Handy &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like it’s performing these jobs, but really it was only carrying out a prearranged demo. Who knows how capable, if at all, this robot is in the real world? At least Alphabet is finding this out for itself. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Cowboy Bebop’s jazz-infused sci-fi mirrors Afrofuturism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qveQgKZjJOF3Pxr-fhQyP399sM=/0x30:720x510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165617/CBP_e023_0052.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sunrise Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From the original anime to the new live-action series on Netflix&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tUAITM"&gt; As a young child, I was a dreamer. I wanted to be an astronaut, and despite living in a world that constantly reinforced that Black femmes would hardly walk the moon, my family encouraged me to be driven and reach for the stars — literally. My father fed my imaginative spirit by giving me books on the Solar System and inspiring me to foster a deep love for the futuristic sounds of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyAEUWJlk1Q"&gt;George Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_20BvG3H6DY"&gt;Parliament-Funkadelic&lt;/a&gt;, and jazz music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOpXvJ"&gt;Around this time, my cousin Elliott and I would play video games and stay up late to watch anime. The one that stuck with me the most was &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, a 1998 neo-noir space Western that takes place in 2071. The series, which is directed by &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913860/"&gt;Shinichirō Watanabe&lt;/a&gt;, follows Spike Spiegel and his “crew” of bounty hunters, who are colloquially referred to as cowboys, while simultaneously giving us snapshots of each principal character’s storyline over a backdrop of jazz music. I instantly fell in love with the anime’s aesthetic and tone, a love that would extend well into my adulthood, inspiring me to get a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUDEukUDHz4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; and sing praises of this great body of work time and time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnEX2H"&gt;Looking back on my roots, I not only recognize how crucial &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; was in strengthening my interest and appreciation for anime, but it also bridged the gap between honoring Black music, my budding interest in space, and deepening my relationship with anime and Japanese culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQTqmX"&gt;Even though the main characters of this series are not Black, the music, style, and themes of it resonate with me and feel reminiscent of, and even parallel to, my experience as a Black person. As an adult, I realized that &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; was heavily influenced by the intersections of science fiction and Black culture, or Afrofuturism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="e90cA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Review: Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop has heart, style, and some rough edges","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KZtGWJjlCZIusi6hGYO0y6_POhE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024348/COWBOYBEB_Unit_16866RC4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHW6Ll"&gt;Although the concept has a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/magazine/afrofuturism"&gt;plethora of definitions&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://iac.gatech.edu/people/person/susana-morris"&gt;Susana Morris&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of literature, media, and communication at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Afrofuturism is “a cultural movement, an epistemology that centers Blackness and African diasporic culture and technology.” Its US origins date back to the late 19th century and extend well into the 20th century, where important figures such as &lt;a href="https://blackgirlnerds.com/web-dubois-afrofuturistic-the-comet-withstands-time/"&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/octavia-butlers-prescient-vision-of-a-zealot-elected-to-make-america-great-again"&gt;Octavia Butler&lt;/a&gt; penned works that intentionally centered Blackness and characters in science fiction, and musicians like Herbie Hancock and Sun Ra blended the sounds of rock, jazz, and funk into the soundtrack for these stories. While a major component of Afrofuturism rests on the intersections of the African diaspora and science, there is a deeper connective tissue that transcends all space and time — the creation of a future that is established by and for &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;Black people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bB2EZW"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://iwanimawocha.com/about"&gt;Iwani Mawocha&lt;/a&gt;, a voice actor and model who majored in Afrofuturism, the parallels between Afrofuturism and &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; can be understood through examining the concept of time. “While many people tend to view time as linear or spiralling, many Afrofuturists posit that time is in fact an intricate web, marked by spirals and spokes with no singular direction,” she says. “Ytasha Womack &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlF90sXVfKk&amp;amp;ab_channel=SonicActs"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; how Afrofuturism seamlessly meshes past, present, and future, so that they occur all at the same time. In &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, the past, present, and future are all experienced at once. Although they are in the future in outer space, many of the terrestrial places are in various stages of history. Cities on Earth look a lot like they do now, though far more dilapidated in many places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTqWGi"&gt;You can see the influence of Black music right from the title which references &lt;a href="https://www.jazzinamerica.org/LessonPlan/5/5/230"&gt;bebop&lt;/a&gt;, described by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theyonndon"&gt;Yonn&lt;/a&gt; — a fan and cosplayer — as “a form of jazz that’s very high tempo and ‘scattered,’” that was known for musicians’ improvisational “jam sessions.” The historical essence of bebop and its extensions are also manifested in the titles of each of the episodes, known as sessions, which are named after songs and other cultural references. Composed and arranged by &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/cowboy-bebop-composer-yoko-kanno-to-score-live-action-netflix-series/"&gt;Yoko Kanno&lt;/a&gt;, the music was an iconic feature that reeled many Black anime lovers in. According to content creator and former musician &lt;a href="https://allmylinks.com/bjstewar"&gt;Brandon Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, the score was not only beautifully crafted but also added so much nuance and color to their viewing experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xk83JP"&gt;“The score of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely incredible,” says Stewart. “If it weren’t for the use [of] Black music, Spike Spiegel wouldn’t feel as cool. He is literally the personification of the freedom, suaveness, creativity, adaptability and spirit of jazz.” Stewart also notes that the music and the series were a part of a larger movement that rekindled an interest in jazz music in upcoming generations, giving rise to artists such as Robert Glasper and Masego.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvPa72qiQfUF6n2mFMyf7qTdFkE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024354/COWBOYBEB_ArtDept_01192RC4.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zj0Xmc"&gt;Building a better world and existence for Black people and other principles of Afrofuturism cannot be achieved without first acknowledging the importance, inclusion, and need for representation of all Black people. The vast majority of esteemed creative works in sci-fi are by white people with depictions devoid of Blackness, which feeds into an insidious and anti-Black implication that Black people are not included nor present in a fictional or foreseeable future. Afrofuturism is a direct response to this false narrative. “It posits that Blackness and Black people are vital to the continuation of humanity,” Morris tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jB2MMz"&gt;Developing our future includes understanding the tragedies of our past and how they take shape in the blueprint of what lies ahead. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, this concept is evident through the main characters’ relationships with their past traumas and how they are a catalyst for redefining their present and next steps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyjn0m"&gt;“So much of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s substance comes from the characters’ pasts. They each end up having to face what they’ve been suppressing, or in Faye’s case, actively running from. But not everyone makes that decision to heal. &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/cowboy-bebop-jet-arm-lost-prosthetic-explained/"&gt;We see Jet with a prosthetic arm&lt;/a&gt; that the day’s technology could’ve replaced with a real one, but he chose to hold onto that artifact from his past,” says &lt;a href="https://iyaniwuraoa.com/"&gt;Iyaniwura&lt;/a&gt;, a visual artist and Cosbear — or customized teddy bears dressed in cosplay — creator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4drMmM"&gt;Blackness and Black culture are depicted in the series in a way that honors famous Black cultural icons. Briauna Kilgore, a social media specialist at &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackgirlsanime/?hl=en"&gt;Black Girls Anime&lt;/a&gt;, feels that “this anime is not only influenced and connected to Black culture but pays homage and gives a great tribute to Black culture.” “One example is the character &lt;a href="https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Coffee"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; in the ‘Mushroom Samba’ session. This character was clearly inspired by the beautiful and talented Pam Grier! Not only is this legendary actress gorgeous but she was also the first woman action star in the 1970’s for her starring roles. Her role in the film &lt;em&gt;Coffy&lt;/em&gt; is what &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/anime/news/cowboy-bebop-cosplay-coffee-best-anime-girls/"&gt;inspired this character&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EyLcE"&gt;Performance artist and creator Makeba Mongold, widely known as &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/makirollofc"&gt;Maki Roll&lt;/a&gt;, expresses that “&lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; does a really good job of adding cultural influences into the show without it seeming heavy handed or appropriative.” The characters were developed in a way that honors audiences rather than panders to them. “In our current entertainment landscape, a lot of diverse characters feel more like they’re created out of obligation than love, but in &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; it felt as though they were there because they belonged,” says Mawocha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MD6GB"&gt;Representation of various racial backgrounds, both visually and sonically, was very important for Watanabe, which can be seen in &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; and other projects he’s directed and produced like &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/05/24/music-man-shinichiro-watanabe-the-music-producer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michiko &amp;amp; Hatchin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;. In an &lt;a href="https://comicbook.com/anime/news/cowboy-bebop-director-opens-up-about-animes-focus-on-diversity/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; for an art book entitled &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop: The Jazz Messengers&lt;/em&gt;, the director explains that he “paid a lot of attention to skin color. Lots of times when you watch anime, the characters have white skin — all the characters in fantasy stories all have white skin, which I never liked. I wanted to have lots of characters in Bebop without the white skin, and if people weren’t used to that, well, maybe it would even make them think a little bit about it.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zjh2IL"&gt;Watanabe’s level of awareness and intention set the precedent for other anime to come, establishing a step in the right direction for BIPOC representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IX3PUgHVGiKx1H6GMbOnLY95ALQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23024380/CBP_e005_0239.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sunrise Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Ot2G"&gt;Although viewers have developed a fondness and deep respect for &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;interpretation of futuristic life, it is not above critique and there is more work to be done. Inspired by his love for the anime and Black storytelling, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://linkna.me/kp"&gt;Kolanut Productions&lt;/a&gt; Obichukwu Udeh helped to create &lt;a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/neptunes-bluez/list?title_no=602776&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neptune’s Bluez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a story that “reimagines &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; as an all Black space adventure [that] brings Harlem to the cosmos,” he shares with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Driven by a character based on the legendary Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the story takes place in a universe where mumble rappers and space suits designed from African masquerades make for a true adventure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GACuJl"&gt;Afrofuturism goes beyond having a futuristic aesthetic. It also lays the foundation for Black creators to use art as a means of centering Blackness and creating opportunities for Black communities to exist and thrive in a better world. Several Black creatives are striving to use their creativity to give Black people spaces to feel seen. Artists like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MidCenturyMami"&gt;Tara Fay Coleman&lt;/a&gt; use their expertise in &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/mstarafay/?hl=en"&gt;art and curation&lt;/a&gt; to center Black culture. “So much of art is viewed through the lens of whiteness, and I am intentional about shifting that lens by creating exhibitions that speak to our lived experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFsZN5"&gt;These efforts are being made on the literary front as well, where journalists such as Erika Hardison, the publisher of the inaugural, indie Black feminist mag &lt;a href="http://fabulizemag.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fabulize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;use their platform to create access for other Black creatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ44kD"&gt;“I try to use my opportunities to highlight Black creatives who are making waves across genres. For every Black entrepreneur, author, creative and business I interview and highlight, I’m doing my part to ensure that those stories get told in the media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyvR0X"&gt;The upcoming live action adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, which is Netflix’s “&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cowboy-bebop-live-action-canon-expansion-not-same-anime-story"&gt;expansion to the canon&lt;/a&gt;,” casts Mustafa Shakir as Jet. The choice of casting this character as Black not only creates more opportunities for Black people to see themselves on-screen but was also influenced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BeauBillingslea"&gt;Beau Billingslea&lt;/a&gt;, the actor &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/22772957/cowboy-bebop-voice-cast-actors-best-episodes"&gt;who voiced Jet&lt;/a&gt; in the US dub of the anime. Reflecting on his career, Billingslea refers to Jet as “being drawn grey” and notes that during that point in his career, he notes that most characters he voiced were raceless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXhACs"&gt;“[When being casted] it wasn’t about the color of my skin, it was about the quality of my voice and my quality of work,” he says to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“If they had only hired me to voice persons of color, I wouldn’t have worked because there weren’t any in anime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v67y71"&gt;Billingslea feels that the casting of Shakir is important and that it will draw more audiences to loving both the live action and original, animated series. With Billingslea being a part of the movement that paved the way for those like Shakir, it illustrates the upward mobility of Black people and our representation, but it does not stop there. We have to continue to create more opportunities for all Black people to thrive and exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ubVwOQ"&gt;“Some people reach an elevated point and pull the ladder away so that no one else can follow,” says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrAJCosplay"&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;, a writer and video producer. “I want to help build and fortify the ladder so that others can follow me. We must share and uplift each other so that we can all stand profoundly together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9BfOb"&gt;The Miami City Commission has voted to end its multiyear experiment with shared electric scooters. In a four to five vote, the commission approved a “pocket item” (a last-minute legislative maneuver) to end the Miami scooter pilot. The ordinance went into effect at midnight November 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGuXm0"&gt;Since 2018, Miami residents and tourists have been able to use mobile apps to rent dockless electric scooters. Companies have until 5PM on Friday, November 19th, to retrieve their scooters from the streets or the city will impound them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym8Qz2"&gt;“We’re shutting it down,” said Commissioner Alex Díaz de la Portilla, according to &lt;a href="https://www.masstransitmag.com/alt-mobility/shared-mobility/bicycle-scooter-sharing/news/21247344/fl-miami-commissioners-order-motorized-scooters-taken-off-city-streets-immediately"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Transit&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wOYYv"&gt;Scooters typically draw some controversy wherever they’re deployed, but the electric two-wheelers were particularly divisive in Miami. Supporters claimed they were useful in reducing car usage and connecting residents to transit hubs. Critics said they were a nuisance, blocking sidewalks and creating situations in which unskilled riders were in danger of being injured in traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PbFj18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re shutting it down”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Erpwl2"&gt;The scooter companies were incensed by the vote. “We’re extremely disappointed in the Commission’s hasty and short sighted action to end the scooter program, taking away a safe and popular transportation option used by thousands of Miami residents daily and putting dozens of workers out of a job the week before Thanksgiving,” Caroline Samponaro, VP of transit, bike and scooter policy at Lyft, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4grDw"&gt;Samponaro cited recent comments by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez in support of shared electric scooters while speaking at the LA Auto Show. “We are hopeful he will stand up to the Commission on behalf of Miami residents and visitors to stop this action,” she said of the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujZUWz"&gt;Commissioners who voted to end the pilot claimed to be motivated by safety. “On Biscayne Boulevard, at whatever hour of the day, you see kids on these scooters,” said Díaz de la Portilla, who led the effort to end the program, according to &lt;em&gt;Mass Transit&lt;/em&gt;. “This is an accident waiting to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY3uAI"&gt;Other cities have used safety as a pretext for banning scooters. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18701299/nashville-electric-scooter-ban-man-killed"&gt;Nashville shut down its e-scooter pilot in 2019&lt;/a&gt; after an intoxicated man was killed by a car driver while riding a scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgFSCs"&gt;Micromobility supporters often point out that cars and trucks, not scooters, pose the biggest threat to people on the road. When someone is injured while riding a scooter or other lightweight vehicle, it is often because cities have done little to protect them, like install protected bike lanes, reduce speed limits, or promote policies to encourage walking, bicycling, and scooter riding. Banishing scooters, they argue, just reinforces the notion that streets are for cars and not people. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yubico key organizer keeps your house keys tidy and your YubiKey security key safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1_grT-jo-xX1cH7g87MBsKE51rY=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165585/keyport_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yubico x Keyport Pivot 2.0 key organizer.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Yubico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="APZZx7"&gt;Yubico has teamed up with Keyport on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fpivot2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791271%2Fyubico-x-keyport-pivot-2-0-key-organizer-yubikey-security-key" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new key organizer&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to safely stash your YubiKey security key (a small dongle that can act as an extra layer of security for your logins) alongside your house keys in one compact little enclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpvwRA"&gt;It’s a neat idea. My house keys have to put up with a lot of abuse from being carried around in my pockets and stuffed in the bottom of backpacks. And while I’m not too worried about a set of metal keys surviving this kind of treatment, I wouldn’t say not to a little more protection for a USB dongle that I need to access my most secure accounts. YubiKeys are built like tanks, but nothing’s invincible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Nmp1M9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use a two-factor security key","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22458935/two-factor-security-key-how-to-yubico"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="A9V2aG"&gt;The $25 Yubico x Keyport Pivot 2.0 key organizer appears to have been released &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mykeyport.com%2Fblogs%2Fkeyport-blog%2Fyubico-x-keyport-partnership&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791271%2Fyubico-x-keyport-pivot-2-0-key-organizer-yubikey-security-key" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s functionally a very similar accessory to Keyport’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mykeyport.com%2Fproducts%2Fpivot-2-key-organizer&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791271%2Fyubico-x-keyport-pivot-2-0-key-organizer-yubikey-security-key" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;existing Pivot 2.0&lt;/a&gt; organizer. The differences appear to amount to a small Yubico logo on its outside, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fpivot2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791271%2Fyubico-x-keyport-pivot-2-0-key-organizer-yubikey-security-key" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yubico’s website&lt;/a&gt; also notes that this version doesn’t include Keyport’s lost and found service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFDNXy"&gt;Alongside a YubiKey security key, the organizer has space for up to seven other key-sized items. As well as keys, Keyport sells a variety of tools that are designed to sit in its holders, like multi-tools, mini-flashlights, and pens. Compatible YubiKeys include the 5 Series, as well as its new Bio Series, which are activated using a fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMKieJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A finder’s fee won’t guarantee a PS5 from Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy this holiday </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4G4HLYXFzD3PJ-xCqd4dDHF3IqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165429/vpavic_4261_20201023_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TMAP0s"&gt;It’s still difficult to find a PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch OLED, or practically any desktop graphics card made in the last three years. &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; difficult that many people resort to paying scalpers far more than it should cost to get one. This trend has stuck around since the early days of the pandemic, and it might not change any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vVmGv"&gt;This year, the likes of Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart signaled that they, too, would like to become console and GPU scalpers, in a sense. Each began hosting some restock events you couldn’t access unless you had a paid subscription to Amazon Prime, Walmart Plus, or Best Buy’s new “Totaltech.” But don’t fall for the notion that these services will go the extra mile for you. In fact, they don’t guarantee the basic tools you need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk6cMi"&gt;While Scalpers have what you want and will give it to you if you pay, that’s not how it works with these subscriptions. Yes, instead of going up against countless others in a restock battle royale, you might be competing with a smaller set of paying customers, theoretically boosting your chances of success. But it’s still a total gamble. It’s essentially a cover charge to get into the same page where you might be able to click a buy button, or you might not. And the more people who pay the cover charge, the worse your chances get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RzGeAe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t fall for the notion that these services will go the extra mile for you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hw2vIf"&gt;It didn’t take long for people to realize none of these memberships guarantee the most important element of snapping up a new console: getting alerted about when these restocks are actually happening. One shared theme with the likes of Amazon Prime, Best Buy Totaltech, and Walmart Plus is their overall lack of communication with subscribers. They rarely provide any heads-up about these restock opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjbUiosqHh3QWL8lrXIWzDjPkbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552884/rtx3080ti.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Founders Edition RTX 3080 Ti has a retail price of 1,199.99, but &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://stockx.pvxt.net/c/482924/530344/9060?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstockx.com%2Fnvidia-founders-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-graphics-card%3Fcountry%3DUS%26currencyCode%3DUSD&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the lowest price at StockX&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is currently $1,778.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gLUKbw"&gt;Without some serious strides in how these retailers communicate with subscribers, you’ll likely still be outpaced in getting a console or GPU by people who have made a hobby out of following Twitter profiles like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wario64/"&gt;Wario64&lt;/a&gt;, who’s known for being among the first to post news of restocks; joining the relevant Discord servers that obsessively track restocks; and being quick to the draw with the refresh button on your browser (and knowing when to stop tapping refresh to avoid getting flagged as a spammer, too). Sadly, all of this is among the best advice out there for finding success yourself. It’s no surprise that careers have been made from this unusual supply and demand climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="asvbbq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with a subscription, you may be outpaced by people who’ve turned restocks into a hobby — or a career&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kDZbUt"&gt;It’s part of my role here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, alongside my colleagues, to figure out if it’s actually possible to get these hard-to-find items when a retailer claims to have them in stock and running through the chaotic process of trying to buy one ourselves (don’t worry, we throw them back in the water for everyone else). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYS8rB"&gt;While I don’t recommend any of these memberships if all that you want to do is score a console, they’re useful for things like free shipping or scoring some discounts. So I can see why some might subscribe to them with the bonus of a scant possibility of finding a new PS5, Switch OLED, Xbox Series X, or a new Nvidia GPU. With Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart being the places where these restocks most frequently occur, we’ve included info below about each subscription, what it’s like to try to score on these sites, and how we think the checkout process could improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JZtBj8"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zMx3uJLJwxXTzTlRoxk0ZeU9q60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19218416/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="spFaxG"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I5o8vz"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"&gt;its Prime subscription&lt;/a&gt; that costs $119.99 per year or $12.99 per month (if you’re fine paying more in total each year to be on a month-to-month plan). It nets you complementary fast shipping, access to Prime Video streaming, and a variety of other perks, including being the key that gets you in the door for some exclusive restocking events. Notably, you can get all of these perks — and access to its Prime Day shopping event — even with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G6RZ3AA6NQMCKYEM"&gt;a free trial to Prime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmOvGU"&gt;Actually getting into one of Amazon’s Prime-exclusive console restocks is almost entirely the result of seeing the right tweet at the right time. Amazon’s restocks tend to sell out much faster than they do at Walmart or Best Buy. In minutes, or sometimes less, things usually go out of stock, but it’s also usually unclear whether it’s actually stock or a site stability issue instead. I’ve had luck buying a PS5 by constantly refreshing pages that seem inactive or broken. Even when items went to my cart, it was a trial-and-error process that ended in failure more than success. So, it’s not the most elegant process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9QhQS"&gt;To my knowledge, Amazon hasn’t attempted a queueing system for console restocks, which would be the most fair way to go. Instead, it’s a free-for-all that’s far too easy to miss out on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LLwqVN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a trial-and-error process that ends in failure more than success&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EmjmxV"&gt;While it’s not usually limited to Prime members, Amazon also sends out text messages to those who register for updates on its Treasure Truck, which previously has offered the PS5 and Nintendo Switch OLED for Prime customers only. Though, in both cases, these text messages didn’t arrive until after each had already sold out. So, not much help there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEtKjd"&gt;When I asked Amazon if it intended to improve how it communicates with Prime subscribers who aren’t on the restock beat, an Amazon spokesperson dodged my inquiries, talking instead about the other benefits of a Prime subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Walmart Raises Forecast As Earnings Beat Estimates" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncJd1HKIHMEYwr0rYBDHoC1-hBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23025607/1353679329.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tTeU9C"&gt;Walmart Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jzYuBU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt; is $98 per year or $12.95 per month if you’d rather pay more to go month-to-month. It offers free shipping with no order minimum, discounts on prescriptions and fuel, the ability to scan and checkout from the Walmart app on your phone (you’ll still need to finalize the order at a self-checkout kiosk), and more. It’s also offering exclusive restock opportunities for subscribers, in addition to giving them four hours of early access to shop its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;. One caveat is that, unlike Prime, you need to be a paying member to take advantage of these perks. Being on its 15-day trial won’t suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnkzcw"&gt;Word of Walmart restocks usually spreads on Twitter a few hours before they actually go live, though the company rarely sends the news out via official channels. Recently, about half of those restock events seem to have been exclusive to Walmart Plus subscribers, with the others being openly available to anyone with a free Walmart account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TxYHu"&gt;It’s tough to know what it’s going to be like jumping into any given Walmart restock. I’ve had luck refreshing the page the moment it goes live, adding a PS5 to a cart, and buying it. Most other times, though, its site hangs and crashes in frustrating ways. Its “add to cart” buttons usually aren’t quick enough to show as “out of stock,” often leading me to believe I still have a chance even when I actually don’t. Walmart’s restocks usually come in waves, with new stock replenishing every 10 minutes for a few rounds, so it’s good to stick around for a while, refreshing frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v699Zh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s tough to know what it’s going to be like jumping into any given Walmart restock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YjX7S"&gt;More recently, Walmart has experimented with a new queueing system that lets you shop around while you wait for a timer to run down. While it’s more orderly in theory, it didn’t make the process of getting a console any easier. My wait for an Xbox Series X hung at “one minute remaining” for about 30 minutes until it notified me that it was out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4JasU"&gt;I asked Walmart if it could share more detailed plans for future restocking events for its Walmart Plus subscribers and how it aims to improve communication, but the retailer declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ayo2V2"&gt;Best Buy Totaltech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xFgmKg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17AZjAf3K" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s&lt;/a&gt; Totaltech costs $200 per year and grants you complimentary Geek Squad tech support, exclusive discounts, up to two years of warranty support on most products (so long as you remain a member), free, fast shipping, an extended return and exchange window, and more. It has already hosted several exclusive opportunities for Totaltech members to buy a PS5, the Nintendo Switch OLED, and the Xbox Series X, though the retailer offers as many, if not more, opportunities that don’t require a subscription — just a free My Best Buy account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICl11a"&gt;Where Best Buy sticks out from Amazon and Walmart actually has nothing to do with its Totaltech membership. Over the past year, it has hosted ticketed, in-store restocking events each month that grant early birds a ticket, guaranteeing them the ability to buy one of these products once doors open. This is a particularly big deal to some PC gamers who are after Nvidia’s Founder’s Edition graphics cards, which are exclusively sold at Best Buy in the US and easier to fit into PCs than those made by many aftermarket brands. Of course, whether you’re after a GPU or a PS5, supply is still very limited. That said, your chances seem better here than what Totaltech or any competing subscriptions can offer — and it’s free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSn1GH"&gt;Whether you’re a Totaltech member or not, Best Buy has the most stable online queuing system of any site that I’ve tried to use during restocks. I’ve successfully added consoles and GPUs to my cart, before releasing them back in the wild.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zGpxJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Best Buy has the most stable online queuing system of any site that I’ve used, plus some in-store restocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqpk8D"&gt;Carly Charlson, director of public relations at Best Buy, shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company knows there are “more customers shopping for them than what’s available” and that its teams “are working on the best ways to alert them when they’re available.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhZpZi"&gt;For many (but not all) of its in-store restocks, Best Buy will post about them a day in advance to give you some heads-up. That’s not the case with online restocks. Those usually go live without advanced notice, requiring you to be paying close attention to Twitter or Discord if you want the best chances of succeeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKhlxy"&gt;Best Buy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it alerted Totaltech members via email about a recent PS5 and Nintendo Switch OLED restock a day in advance, then followed up with a push notification via the Best Buy app once inventory went live. Strangely, it also shared that this kind of outreach won’t happen for every restock in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ai8vEjJ5BZr7CZcbM2OA8D8jVeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22263398/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IzUJwh"&gt;What other paid options exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FMn1yz"&gt;If you want to take a look outside of what the biggest retailers are doing (and not doing) for eager console shoppers, GameStop offers exclusive restocking opportunities for subscribers to its PowerUp Rewards Pro service, in addition to&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=VergePS5111821&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; other gaming-centric perks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUcNiG"&gt;Subscribers will get “first dibs on new console drops, graphics cards, collectibles, and more.” What’s more, it explicitly informs its subscribers via email about upcoming console drops. It costs $14.99 per year. According to&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-restock-tracker-retailers-prep-black-friday/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;CNET’s &lt;/em&gt;post on tracking PS5 restocks&lt;/a&gt;, the retailer lets PowerUp Rewards Pro members have a go at the consoles one hour ahead of everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cJV2bW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GameStop notoriously offers the priciest bundles in many of its exclusive restocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeMrKW"&gt;GameStop gets the nod for being more affordable than the subscriptions mentioned above, but it offers the fewest amount of perks. You’ll get a little promotional credit each month for sticking with the subscription, as well as discounts on games, and a subscription to the &lt;em&gt;Game Informer&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Though, it notoriously offers only the most expensive console bundles in almost all of its exclusive restock events. GameStop stuffs the bundles with games, controllers, and gift cards you might not want, and this is the thanks you get for subscribing to its service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3Xks9O"&gt;What if you don’t want to buy any subscriptions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ignVXa"&gt;Some manufacturers themselves have offered registration to give you a chance at buying products in a more orderly manner. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772145/ps5-restock-sony-ps-direct-november-holiday-playstation-5-register-email" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony is accepting free registration&lt;/a&gt; to express interest in purchasing its PlayStation 5, though it doesn’t ensure that you’ll get an invite. Instead, its selection process is determined on “previous interests and PlayStation activity,” not a first-come, first-served basis. I’m sure this is helping some people get consoles, but it’s certainly not a sure-fire way to get one soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XR78O7"&gt;Computer components company EVGA did the logical thing of just allowing people to sign up to buy an Nvidia RTX 30-series graphics card in early 2021, letting people buy it once their number in line is called. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776567/evga-line-queue-to-get-nvidia-rtx-3000-graphics-card-works" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s how my colleague Sean Hollister scored an RTX 3060 at MSRP&lt;/a&gt; — it only took &lt;em&gt;nine months&lt;/em&gt; to reach his spot in line. Still, to him, it felt like a fair system at work. Sadly, EVGA halted its queues, so it’s not currently available to sign up for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0i4C4AWF6f0y7PybLCCvSEfQsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005942/verge_sean_hollister_evga_rtx_3060_20211111_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;EVGA used to let people sign up to be offered a chance to buy graphics cards, though its queue system is not currently available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aA5mUj"&gt;We might all be a bit happier if more retailers adopted more sensible queuing methods. If paying for a subscription increased your chances of getting what you want sooner &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;made it easier to do it at your own pace, that’d be great, too. Unfortunately, it seems like we’re not totally there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHhxBm"&gt;That’s the strange part about all of this. Retailers are good at sending out lots of marketing emails, yet this kind of personalized email or text outreach seems to have befuddled even the biggest stores. Or perhaps it’s not befuddling them, and they just choose not to do it. After all, these restocks generate a huge level of buzz and traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LWg3L"&gt;I wonder if the reality is somewhere in the middle. It can’t be overstated how limited stock is, and perhaps for site stability and security purposes, it behooves retailers to be as vague as possible — even to paying subscribers. On the other hand, retailers are fully aware that this frenzy won’t last forever, and as a business, it’s in their interest to turn as many of you as possible into regular-paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbXnOM"&gt;As these subscriptions currently exist, they want to get you in the door with the promise of exclusive access to restocking opportunities. I want these services to improve because they could be more useful for people who choose to pay. But without offering a real guarantee of success, they’re arguably worse than scalpers. They’re taking a cut of this madness with too little to show for it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite turned Craig into a rock star</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSX0nEFcRaz5pM3AeJoYOjOVNZQ=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165313/Q3EnkCx.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XumIBz"&gt;One day you’re just another Brute on the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ring minding your own business, and the next you’re a rock star. That’s Craig, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s infamous Brute that appeared in the notorious trailer last year. He might have originally represented the poor quality of graphics in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;original &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, but now he has been memorialized as a rock star inside the game in an Easter egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQc1En"&gt;The Craig shrine can be discovered on top of a giant tower in the fourth campaign mission in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. It includes a greatest hits album and a tour poster with dates for when Craig is holding a Zeta Halo tour. Songs include classics like “The Day You Become a Meme, I Got Tears Last Summer” and “I Smile Inside.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0OhDbDFB5st95A9dros00we3dSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027177/OLGcMNd.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craig’s greatest hits album.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuQ1mo"&gt;The Brutes inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; (like Craig) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744656/microsoft-halo-infinite-craig-brute-improved-graphics"&gt;have had a glow-up&lt;/a&gt; since we last saw them, and the graphical improvements leave just the memory of Craig in players’ minds. 343 Industries has promised Craig Easter eggs, so there could be even more to discover throughout the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBvwAX"&gt;Mint Blitz, a YouTuber who is so good at &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; I’m convinced his arms are autonomous, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_1kT_E1m4M"&gt;discovered the hidden Easter egg&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign missions. You’ll need to upgrade your Grappleshot, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22789035/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;awesome new ability in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to the 40 percent cooldown reduction in order to get to the top of the tower. Once you’re there, you can pick up a collectible skull and check out Craig’s wonderful rock star shrine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Otter.ai is limiting its free plan to 30-minute transcriptions starting December 1st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Otter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GsphqH20S7fsY7rXvk31lX-XWNU=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165281/otter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lgn9Mx"&gt;Otter.ai is adding new limitations to the free Otter Basic plan on the subscription service, which will limit free users to 30-minute transcriptions starting December 1st, down from the current 40-minute limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fvD24"&gt;The company says that the changes are “due to increased costs and to maintain high standards of service.” Otter.ai is still offering the same 600 minutes of transcription per month to free users, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmwUAi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The overall monthly limit for free users isn’t changing, however&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXhBmB"&gt;The change isn’t hugely problematic in the long run, given that Otter.ai still isn’t changing the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; amount of transcription that free users can do — just the amount that you can have transcribed in a single recording. That means that attentive users can simple just start a new file once the 30-minute limit is reached, although you’ll generally have to pay attention to when you’re creeping up on the time limit (and lose the benefit of having everything in a single document). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJCn64"&gt;Otter.ai customers who need the capability for longer recordings can pay for Otter Pro, which costs $99.99 per year or $12.99 per month. That price gets you transcriptions up to four hours long, up to 6,000 minutes of transcription each month, and additional features including custom vocabulary lists and the ability to import prerecorded files. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei MateBook 16 review: a nose(cam) short of great</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It has an excellent screen, but some weird quirks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dzH3QW"&gt;Huawei laptops haven’t been widely available in the US for years. But they’ve traditionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17396818/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-specs-price"&gt;been fantastic products&lt;/a&gt;, with good enough performance and build quality to make them serious MacBook competitors. So I figured I’d review the MateBook 16, Huawei’s latest flagship notebook, even though it may not be on the radars of our US readers. Consider this a resource for those in markets where Huawei is still operating but also a quick check on what the rest of us are missing out on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CkuEj"&gt;On the outside, the MateBook 16… kind of looks like a MacBook Pro. Huawei’s got the colors and the general vibe down pat. Whether it performs as well as a MacBook is, of course, another question. Most of the MateBook 16 is great, from the speedy and comfortable keyboard to the all-day battery life, massive 3:2 display, and surprisingly powerful speakers. I know people who have replaced MacBooks with MateBooks as a primary driver, and I can see how for most office workers, the daily experience is quite similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERexf5"&gt;But the main difference is that when I’m using a MateBook, I occasionally come across weird things. They’re not things that make or break the experience, but they’re just odd flaws for such a nice laptop to have. And they add up to make a product that’s great but not as great as it feels like it easily could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6jx6PT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10873827"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Huawei MateBook 16 on a black table facing forward, open. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJK1Ck3zU5OKMckBDJ9Pn2qrtys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22906773/akrales_211005_4788_0053.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could convince me this was a MacBook in dim lighting from far away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HoTVFH"&gt;I should note, before we get too far into this, that the MateBook is only available in a somewhat limited number of countries. Currently, you can only order it directly from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fmatebook-16%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huawei’s site&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in China or Germany as of this writing. (I can’t imagine it will be available within the US any time soon, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684274/huawei-honor-blacklist-entity-list-commerce-pentagon-energy-state"&gt;Huawei’s relationship with&lt;/a&gt; the Biden administration.) If you’re outside of those countries but are willing to ship one over, I have found &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002700344861.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;models on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; for as low as $1,259. My test unit, which has a Ryzen 7 5800H, 16GB of memory, and 512G of storage, is currently available for $1,469 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aliexpress.com%2Fitem%2F1005002700344861.html%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22790175%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-review-price-speces-features-amd-ryzen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on AliExpress&lt;/a&gt;. (Of course, the usual caveats about ordering from third-party sites apply if you’re going to shop there — you probably won’t recieve a warranty, you may need to get a separate charger, and you should make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MhYjAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The highlight of this device is the display&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FcH2zk"&gt;If you are able to get your hands on one of these, it has a number of selling points. It’s fairly light for a 16-inch notebook at 4.39 pounds. The trackpad is smooth and roomy, though it occasionally had issues with palm rejection. The keyboard is sturdy and impressively quiet — it’s probably the most MacBook-esque keyboard I’ve ever used on a Windows laptop (and I mean the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;recent models&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;god-awful butterfly ones&lt;/a&gt;). There’s a useful port selection with two USB-C, two USB-A, a headphone jack, and HDMI. The speakers are quite good, with bass that’s a bit weak. It’s got an unobtrusive, professional look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad on the Huawei MateBook 16 seen from above and to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g8y5J1bfUuWEW21m9ZNBNpFi-0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908078/akrales_211005_4788_0040.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The touchpad is “a durable matte glass.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z0rtMj"&gt;The highlight of the device, for me, is the display. Not only is it a whopping 16 inches, but it has a 3:2 aspect ratio, which is my favorite laptop aspect ratio. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7#:~:text=An%20aspect%20ratio%20is%20the,divides%20down%20to%2016%3A9."&gt;Yes, I have a favorite&lt;/a&gt;.) There’s a ton of vertical space, and I comfortably worked in multiple windows side by side; as someone who generally uses a 13-incher, the extra room feels luxurious. The panel itself, while not quite MacBook quality, still displays strong colors and sharp details and kicked back almost no glare. I enjoyed looking at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The power button on the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aK8quarfyUuVxCzVd8qyRxef4wM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908077/akrales_211005_4788_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader in the power button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0Adq4a"&gt;Now, for the weird things. The MateBook’s microphones come equipped with Huawei’s Ai noise cancelation technology that’s supposed to reduce echo and ambient noise, but coworkers said that it made me sound very weird on Zoom calls. It was clearly processing my voice while I was speaking; someone said I sounded like I was underwater. They could still hear and understand me just fine, but it’s an odd caveat to such a nice laptop. I’ve asked Huawei about this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em8xaa"&gt;Another oddity: the SSD is partitioned? There are essentially two drives on the MateBook 16. I’ve asked Huawei why this is, but I really can’t fathom why this would be necessary on a consumer laptop. It seems likely to cause needless confusion and hassle — I had various downloads interrupted midway because they’d been dumped into a partition that didn’t have room, and I had to move a bunch of things around to accommodate a large folder I was trying to load that was well under 512GB but too big for either partition. Finding files and applications that I needed was also more complicated, because I couldn’t always remember which drive they were on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNWMYS"&gt;And finally, the webcam. The MateBook has a nosecam that pops out of the keyboard’s top row when you press down on it. This, to me, is the equivalent of having no webcam — I’d rather be a black square on Zoom calls than have coworkers staring up my nostrils. So that’s also a thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="dHBO0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The microphones made me sound weird on Zoom calls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Huawei MateBook 16, open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKYRI_-_jH0Hq2OfOq6uS_ebdbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925609/akrales_211012_4788_0134.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, this is where the webcam is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the Huawei MateBook 16, depressed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YHj9m8Jft46JL30wr4pY1NFp7YQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925608/akrales_211012_4788_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, seriously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9JGENg"&gt;Huawei enthusiasts can use a Multi-Screen collaboration feature to connect the MateBook 16 to a Huawei phone or tablet. You can then drag and drop files between the tethered devices, access their apps interchangeably, or use the latter as a traditional external display. I wasn’t able to test this, as I didn’t have any Huawei phones or tablets on hand, but it sounds convenient and similar to Apple’s Sidecar feature. It does seem that you have to &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-matebook-16-review-3028122/"&gt;enter a passcode&lt;/a&gt; every time you reconnect a device, which would probably drive me up the wall after a while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KF40td"&gt;The MateBook also connects easily to Huawei earbuds — per Huawei, the two gadgets will prompt you to pair them automatically if you put them near each other. Huawei is clearly moving towards a robust and developed ecosystem, though whether people buy in will likely depend on how well the features continue to work as new products are released. Regardless, it’s something I’m jealous of as someone whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose 700&lt;/a&gt; come disconnected from her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book&lt;/a&gt; at least a few times a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;90 percent screen-to-body ratio — it’s a beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TdcNIf"&gt;As a work driver, the MateBook’s eight-core Ryzen processor did an excellent job. The fans were silent under heaps of Chrome tabs, Spotify streaming, and Zoom calls. I was never worried about anything crashing or slowing down, and nothing was ever hot. You can switch to a dedicated Performance Mode by pressing FN+P, though I’m not sure where a user who doesn’t have Huawei’s reviewers’ guide would find that information out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvdVfZ"&gt;As we generally expect from AMD Ryzen 5000 systems, the MateBook did quite well on multi-core benchmarks and lagged behind a bit on single-core devices. It also did not blow any graphical tasks out of the water — AMD’s integrated graphics haven’t received a major update for a couple years. We saw an average of 15 frames per second on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at the MateBook’s native resolution of 2520 x 1680 and 28fps at 1920 x 1080. Neither of those is a fantastic gaming experience, and they’re significantly worse than what we saw from the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Por5PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10874105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K7uBhY"&gt;The MateBook took 13 minutes and 44 seconds to complete our 4K export test. This isn’t a terrible result among AMD systems with integrated graphics, but it does underscore the delta between a system like this and a heavier-duty creative workstation (which people often expect 16-inch laptops to be). The most recent MacBook Pros, even the 14-incher, all took under three minutes for the same task. On the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/"&gt;Puget Systems&lt;/a&gt; benchmark for Premiere Pro, the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=65556"&gt;MateBook also landed&lt;/a&gt; far behind Apple’s machines, including the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/space-gray-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;very similarly priced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=65275"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. None of this is to say that the MateBook is a bad laptop; it’s just to emphasize that you can get more graphics power for this price if that’s a priority for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the right side of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L67Cy7NBjMm_kfcOYJBijN2arS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908080/akrales_211005_4788_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Yp1lMwnDwi-QfwfaNtwZIRcXGw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908074/akrales_211005_4788_0103.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, one HDMI, one audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2J591W"&gt;What AMD’s chips tend to lack in single-core power, though, they often make up for in battery life. The MateBook comes with an 84Wh battery, and I averaged just over 10 hours of continuous use with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. (Huawei claims you’ll get 12.5 hours of “continuous local 1080p video playback,” so I guess take note if you do a lot of that.) That does beat the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; (although not by a ton) and many Intel laptops of this size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnpKIt"&gt;To me, the battery life is the strongest argument in favor of buying the MateBook. It should get you through a workday with no problem, which is especially impressive considering the massive high-resolution screen. I’d love to be able to carry this around a conference, charger-free, and have so much real estate to work with whenever I opened it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AMD Ryzen 7 sticker on the right palm rest of the Huawei MateBook 16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmUnd9v-cCxEuYiM0Q0LDH4WK_Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908076/akrales_211005_4788_0034.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to AMD, it’s Huawei’s most powerful MateBook to date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="liRMMg"&gt;While the MateBook 16 seems like a notebook with the potential to have widespread appeal, the folks I’d most recommend it to are largely still Huawei superfans. The MateBook’s compatibility with other Huawei products is something that nothing from Apple or Asus can offer. I can see that benefit outweighing the odd drawbacks for people that already own other Huawei devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hC3cDy"&gt;For everyone else, I think the MateBook could be a fine purchase for a general work driver, but you can get other laptops with most of the same benefits and without the weirdness surrounding the webcam, speakers, and drive. Even if MacBook Pros are outside your price range, many Ryzen devices have similar performance and battery life to the MateBook, as well as a functional webcam and microphones. The MacBook Air is basically there as well (and as bad as its webcam is, I’ll take that over a nostril shot any day). Basically, I think you have to really, really want the 16-inch, 3:2 screen for the MateBook to have a shot. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 boosters for all US adults</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUXkk3"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration opened booster shots for the &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-receive-expanded-us-fda-emergency-use"&gt;Pfizer / BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-fda-authorization-booster-dose-covid-19"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccine to all adults today, the companies announced, expanding eligibility outside of the initial, vulnerable groups they were cleared for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22728877/fda-boosters-covid-vaccine-moderna-johnson-mix"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679950/fda-covid-vaccine-booster-pfizer-older-adults"&gt;this fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io7B96"&gt;Although the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are still highly effective protection against severe cases of the disease, hospitalization, and death, protection against any infection or symptoms appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/health/covid-cdc-boosters-elderly.html"&gt;weakening&lt;/a&gt;. A third, booster shot of the vaccines could restore that protection: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/21/health/pfizer-booster-dose-efficacy-wellness-bn/index.html"&gt;Pfizer showed&lt;/a&gt; in a clinical trial that the shot was around 95 percent effective compared with people who only had two doses, essentially restoring the same efficacy seen in the initial clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7nsCZ"&gt;Analysis out of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02249-2/fulltext"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the United Kingdom, which have been using booster doses for longer than the US, also show that a third shot significantly blunts infection rates. They’re available to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/uk-extends-covid-booster-vaccines-to-the-over-40s.html"&gt;anyone over 40&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom and anyone &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/30/israel-doubles-down-on-covid-booster-shots-as-breakthrough-cases-rise.html"&gt;over 12&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwyDfw"&gt;Until now, booster shots of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were officially available to people 65 years of age and older, those who are at high risk of severe disease, healthcare workers, and other people at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 at work. However, in response to recent upticks in infection rates, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/arkansas-boosters-adults-covid.html"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; have moved ahead and started offering third doses to everyone. (Everyone who got the one-shot Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22728877/fda-boosters-covid-vaccine-moderna-johnson-mix"&gt;already eligible&lt;/a&gt; for a second dose).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWYlFY"&gt;Just over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total"&gt;16 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the United States who had an initial vaccine series have already received a booster shot.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy will send someone to wash your e-bike and fix flat tires, for a price</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Byxfd2pIDNYs6-ZYQRyICsbY9JU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70164964/ahawkins_210919_4769_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The regular Cowboy 4 (shown here) is also available in a step-through model.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jlLhWg"&gt;Cowboy, one of Europe’s premier makers of electric commuter bikes, is now offering a mobile support service in 22 cities with more to follow; 14 in the EU and eight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22687710/cowboy-ebike-us-sell-c4-price-specs"&gt;in the US where Cowboy only recently set up operations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRxWxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cowboy-bikes.medium.com/e-bike-designer-and-maker-cowboy-unveils-cowboy-care-taking-the-entire-industry-by-storm-and-9fb55a57fb42"&gt;Cowboy Care costs €20 / £20 / $20 a month&lt;/a&gt; and covers cleaning the bike, tightening screws, replacing parts, and fixing flat tires wherever owners might be. It launches just in time for shipments of the much-anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;Cowboy 4 and 4ST e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. After some delays to the original September target, the newest Cowboys will begin deliveries next week to people who got their preorders in early, according to Adrien Roose, co-founder and CEO of Brussels-based Cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2_5eOgNm2iB7SZZ3emdvCQZ21s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027023/cowboy_care.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Cowboy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unlimited number of Cowboy Care appointments can be scheduled in the Cowboy app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jZkYJW"&gt;Cowboy Care appointments — broken down by maintenance, repair, and flat tire fixes — can be booked in Cowboy’s iOS and Android apps. A trained technician, employed by Cowboy, is then dispatched to meet the owner to deal with whatever request they might have. Cowboy notes that care is unlimited, “the technician comes to the rider as many times as they need us there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKNz5P"&gt;In-home repairs are not new for Cowboy. As Roose explained during a phone interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today, the company already dispatches technicians to homes for warranty repairs. Cowboy Care subscriptions extend that model to include maintenance services like cleaning the frame, belt drive, and brakes; tightening the belt, bolts, and screws; topping-up the tire pressure; servicing brakes; top-to-bottom checkups; and fixing flat tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of0SVl"&gt;Parts needed to replace brake pads, tires, and inner tubes are included in the subscription price. However, out-of-warranty repairs like snapped belt drives, busted motors, and batteries that have reached end of life are not currently covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xs6iXw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mobile support is a major new battleground for e-bike companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="72Uy05"&gt;Mobile support is a major new battleground for direct-to-consumer e-bike companies like Cowboy, Rad Power, and VanMoof, each of which have raised millions to build out their networks of roaming technicians. Purchasing an e-bike over the internet can save the buyer money, but bypassing traditional bike shops can mean boxing up your e-bike and shipping it back across the globe for repairs. That’s especially true for e-bikes from makers like Cowboy and VanMoof that use large numbers of custom parts, instead of the off-the-shelf parts found in commodity e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcgUDP"&gt;Cowboy Care is available now in the European cities of Amsterdam, Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, London, Gent, Munich, Brussels, Cologne, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Dusseldorf, Utrecht, and Frankfurt. It’ll be live in the US cities of San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, Seattle, San Diego, and Portland in time for the first US shipments of the C4 and C4ST to arrive in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
