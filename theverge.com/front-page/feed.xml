    <title>ProtonMail court order leads to the arrest of French climate activist</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMrZmZ"&gt;The private email service Protonmail is drawing harsh criticism from its users after providing IP information linked to a French activist who used the service, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/protonmail-logged-ip-address-of-french-activist-after-order-by-swiss-authorities/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dypG3S"&gt;The data was requested as part of a broader investigation into a group of climate activists who have occupied a number of apartments and commercial spaces in Paris. While the members of the group are anonymous, one had used the address “jmm18@protonmail.com” in online postings. As a result, French police sought to identify any persons linked to the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qzVoWW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The prosecution in this particular case was very aggressive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWfMgp"&gt;Because ProtonMail is based in Switzerland, it is not subject to French or EU requests. But the company is still subject to requests from Swiss courts, where French police where able to lodge their request with the help of Europol. After Swiss courts approved the order, ProtonMail began logging IP information on the account, which was subsequently handed over to French police, leading to the activist’s identification and arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjmqR9"&gt;In a post titled &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2Fblog%2Fclimate-activist-arrest%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F6%2F22659861%2Fprotonmail-swiss-court-order-french-climate-activist-arrest-identification" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Important clarifications regarding arrest of climate activist,”&lt;/a&gt; Proton CEO Andy Yen said he shared concern over the prosecution, and gave further detail on the legal issues that had forced the company to provide the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1s42H"&gt;“Proton received a legally binding order from Swiss authorities which we are obligated to comply with. There was no possibility to appeal this particular request,” Yen wrote in the post. “The prosecution in this particular case was very aggressive. Unfortunately, this is a pattern we have increasingly seen in recent years around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIQg4G"&gt;Crucially, the order did not provide the contents of the activist’s email, which are encrypted and cannot be accessed by Proton. Yen said a similar order would also not be able to provide ProtonVPN metadata, as VPNs are subject to different requirements under Swiss law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cjmy4"&gt;Still, the arrest is alarming for many users of ProtonMail, who had expected the service to have more robust protections against legal identification. Yen pledged to update the service’s public documentation to “better clarify ProtonMail’s obligations in cases of criminal prosecution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdhuop"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2Fblog%2Ftransparency-report%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F6%2F22659861%2Fprotonmail-swiss-court-order-french-climate-activist-arrest-identification" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Proton’s own transparency report&lt;/a&gt; shows the alarming growth of Swiss court orders, including those served on behalf of foreign investigations. In 2020, Proton complied with over 3,000 data orders from Swiss courts, more than double the number served in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California bill takes aim at Amazon’s productivity-tracking algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QQafCNk05d-pnFsBiN7uaiY0vBM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69822579/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KD7nHu"&gt;California is poised to pass a new bill pushing back against the productivity measurement algorithms allegedly used in Amazon fulfillment centers, as recently reported by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/03/1033910752/california-bill-targets-fast-paced-working-conditions-at-warehouses"&gt;NPR’s Morning Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/06/business/economy/amazon-california-warehouse-labor.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bill passed California’s lower legislative chamber in May, and the upper chamber is expected to vote on it next week. If passed, the bill would place new transparency requirements on automated quota systems, and block any such systems that could endanger the health and safety of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2l30gA"&gt;Introducing the bill in July, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) cited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; that found “hundreds” of Amazon warehouse employees had been fired for failing to meet productivity quotas at a single facility in Baltimore over the span of just over than a year. Associated documents showed a deeply automated system to track individual employees’ productivity rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q7JzlH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We cannot accept this as the new future of work”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ucpliw"&gt;“To make next-day delivery possible, corporations like Amazon have forced warehouse employees to work faster, service more customers with more orders in record amounts of time, and risk their own bodies in the process,” Assemblywoman Gonzalez said in a statement &lt;a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210705-assemblywoman-gonzalezs-bill-protect-warehouse-workers-dangerous-working"&gt;introducing the bill&lt;/a&gt;. “No worker should be forced to sacrifice their basic human needs, or accept such undignified conditions for a paycheck. We cannot accept this as the new future of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymh9Nu"&gt;Amazon has not publicly taken a position on the bill, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgPPEd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"&gt;The text of Gonzalez’s bill&lt;/a&gt; does not name Amazon, but simply requires all warehouse employers in the state of California to give workers access to the details of any quota used to measure them. Specifically, employees can request “a written description of each quota to which the employee is subject, including the quantified number of tasks to be performed, or materials to be produced or handled, within the defined time period, and any potential adverse employment action that could result from failure to meet the quota.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTkclM"&gt;The bill would also block any quota system that prevents meal and rest breaks, or use of the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jwjDI"&gt;Bathroom breaks are a particularly sore point for Amazon after the company’s high-profile fight over anecdotal reports that the company’s delivery drivers had been forced to pee in bottles while on the job. Amazon initially denied the reports, which resulted in dozens of drivers &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;sharing their own experiences and difficulties taking bathroom breaks while on the job&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of the concern over bathroom breaks has focused on delivery drivers, who would not be subject to the Gonzalez bill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phoebe Waller-Bridge exits Amazon’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Studios Golden Globes After Party - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A6NlS-PIcpnnWBb6-AsvhBQik-g=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69822164/1197880992.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZMa6I"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/phoebe-waller-bridge-out-amazons-mr-mrs-smith-series-1234827795/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/phoebe-waller-bridge-exits-mr-mrs-smith-amazon-1235057187/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has decided to leave Amazon’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&lt;/em&gt; series. She was originally set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22281597/phoebe-waller-bridge-donald-glover-amazon-mr-and-mrs-smith-series"&gt;co-star alongside Donald Glover&lt;/a&gt;, but the Hollywood publications report that creative differences between the two have led the &lt;em&gt;Fleabag&lt;/em&gt; creator to depart the production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSM9kt"&gt;Her exit is described as amicable, and Glover will remain onboard while Waller-Bridge’s role will be recast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7tgaD"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;em&gt;Mr. and Mrs Smith&lt;/em&gt; series, based on the 2005 film starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, was scheduled to go into production in 2022; in addition to her co-starring role, Waller-Bridge also originally planned to executive produce the series along with Glover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwdWHm"&gt;The two previously appeared together in 2018’s &lt;em&gt;Solo: A Star Wars Story. &lt;/em&gt;Their pairing for &lt;em&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&lt;/em&gt; was announced back in February on Instagram, which left many fans excited about the casting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW is reviving its iconic microbus as an electric robotaxi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JX3w6UcrEKVLHUqkXhosGA6e7-k=/0x0:5041x3361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821692/IBA_7846.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AvJ2Da"&gt;Five years after Volkswagen first unveiled its concept for an electric version of its iconic microbus, we’re finally getting our first glimpse of the vehicle on the road. But rather than some throwback to an era of hippies and flower power, the ID Buzz is outfitted with a high-tech suite of sensors and computing smarts for its new role as an autonomous test vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bddFee"&gt;VW says the autonomous ID Buzz will serve as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;platform for the automaker’s full-scale commercial ride-hailing and delivery operation&lt;/a&gt; that it plans on launching in Germany in 2025. For now, VW plans to deploy the ID Buzz on public roads for testing in Munich, as well as at a private track near the city’s airport. The van made its public debut at the 2021 IAA Mobility Event in Munich, which also saw new concepts from Mercedes-Benz and BMW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B3yNvd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VW plans to deploy the ID Buzz on public roads for testing in Munich&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ycqRN"&gt;The vans are using hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW. The automakers formed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation"&gt;“global alliance” back in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to co-develop electric and autonomous vehicles as a way of spread out the costs of what is expected to be an expensive and grueling process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GdyVqC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10737393"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV0xuQ"&gt;As part of that deal, VW invested a staggering $2.6 billion in Argo, which at the time saw its valuation rise to $7 billion. (That valuation has since increased to $12.4 billion as the company explores a public offering.) Argo opened an office in Munich and absorbed VW’s autonomous driving team that was based there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXa4gQ"&gt;Argo currently uses modified Ford vehicles for its testing in the US and has yet to reveal its own purpose-built AV like some of its competitors. The self-driving ID Buzz will be a more fully realized version of Argo’s AV hardware and software, including the company’s 400-meter range lidar sensors developed in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cdq0j7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VW said that it plans to put the vans in service as a ride-sharing fleet under its subsidiar&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;y Moia&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bz28Dq"&gt;VW said that it plans to put the vans in service as a ride-sharing fleet under its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16733944/moia-vw-minivan-shuttle-ridesharing-autonomous"&gt;subsidiary Moia&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2017, Moia has been operating a fleet of electric vehicles as part of its “ride-pooling” service in Hamburg, where it has served 3 million customers to date. Those customers have provided a treasure trove of feedback that will come in use as the company shifts to a completely autonomous fleet by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDeiFM"&gt;Despite initial high hopes, AVs are still far away from being able to drive anywhere under any conditions. The industry has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;consolidating rapidly over the past year&lt;/a&gt;, with many companies being acquired or merging with other companies. It’s a mad dash to keep businesses afloat in the face of lengthening timelines and steep operational costs with little expectation for revenue generation in the near term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4wKX7"&gt;Robotaxis, in particular, are seen as being further out than most companies are predicting. VW and Argo say they remain bullish about their ability to hit the target date. Argo CEO Bryan Salesky has been more realistic about the timeline than most executives, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627847/argo-ai-bryan-salesky-decoder-interview-lyft-self-driving"&gt;telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a recent podcast interview&lt;/a&gt; that the technology will be “ready when it’s ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvDUCH"&gt;Argo has been testing its fourth-generation vehicles in Miami, Austin, and Washington, DC, for the last few years as well as Pittsburgh, Detroit, and California. The company is also planning on launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585764/ford-argo-lyft-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-miami-austin"&gt;a ride-hail service in the US with Lyft&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtirJ9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Flight Simulator’s Top Gun expansion also delayed to 2022 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pfaYslvAlUYR7R9hJi-8bJ2LQQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821437/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_Top_Gun_01_Header.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TPDKaj"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; expansion for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is being delayed to match the movie’s shifted release date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652704/top-gun-maverick-mission-impossible-7-delayed-covid-19-delta-concerns-theaters-paramount"&gt;Paramount announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month that it’s delaying the rest of its 2021 films, pushing &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt; from its Thanksgiving weekend release date to May 27th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31201Z"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; expansion for &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;had been planned for later this year, and will now be “released alongside the movie,” according to Microsoft and Asobo Studio. We still don’t have a whole lot of information on what Asobo Studio is planning to add with the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; expansion, apart from some jets and locations from &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick. “&lt;/em&gt;We look forward to sharing more information in the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/top-gun-maverick-expansion-update/"&gt;says a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Microsoft’s Flight Simulator team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BbSwBE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inGVITjCcXQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c0QhlP"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;originally announced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun &lt;/em&gt;expansion at E3 earlier this year, alongside the launch of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; for the Xbox Series X / S. The teaser trailer for the expansion includes a look at some of the jets coming to &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and even an aircraft carrier that players may be able to land on next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwewmS"&gt;Paramount moved &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick &lt;/em&gt;to 2022 due to concerns around the delta variant and a spike in COVID-19 cases. &lt;em&gt;Jackass Forever &lt;/em&gt;is also being delayed to next year, and &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;will now be released on September 30th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Automated hiring software is mistakenly rejecting millions of viable job candidates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aYdMQDgh5hzA24z2HP_df3brtSM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821232/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MwtxDa"&gt;Automated resume-scanning software is contributing to a “broken” hiring system in the US, says a &lt;a href="https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf"&gt;new report from Harvard Business School&lt;/a&gt;. Such software is used by employers to filter job applicants, but is mistakenly rejecting millions of viable candidates, say the study’s authors. It’s contributing to the problem of “hidden workers” — individuals who are able and willing to work, but remain locked out of jobs by structural problems in the labor market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1K6hgK"&gt;The study’s authors identify a number of factors blocking people from employment, but say automated hiring software is one of the biggest. These programs are used by 75 percent of US employers (rising to 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies), and were adopted in response to a rise in digital job applications from the ‘90s onwards. Technology has made it easier for people to apply for jobs, but also easier for companies to reject them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="onmM97"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automated software relies on overly-simplistic criteria&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ogjal"&gt;The exact mechanics of how automated software mistakenly reject candidates are varied, but generally stem from the use of overly-simplistic criteria to divide “good” and “bad” applicants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZTtQV"&gt;For example, some systems automatically reject candidates with gaps of longer than six months in their employment history, without ever asking the cause of this absence. It might be due to a pregnancy, because they were caring for an ill family member, or simply because of difficulty finding a job in a recession. More specific examples cited by one of the study’s author, Joseph Miller, in an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-need-more-workers-why-do-they-reject-millions-of-resumes-11630728008"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include hospitals who only accepted candidates with experience in “computer programming” on their CV, when all they needed were workers to enter patient data into a computer. Or, a company that rejected applicants for a retail clerk position if they didn’t list “floor-buffing” as one of their skills, even when candidates’ resumes matched every other desired criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbZ7OV"&gt;Over-reliance on software in the hiring world seems to have created a vicious cycle. Digital technology was supposed to make it easier for companies to find suitable job candidates, but instead it’s contributed to a surfeit of applicants. In the early 2010s, the average corporate job posting attracted 120 applicants, says the study, but by the end of the decade this figure had risen to 250 applicants per job. Companies have responded to this deluge by deploying brutally rigid filters in their automated filtering software. This has had the effect of rejecting viable candidates, contributing to the large pool of job-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvRvac"&gt;The use of this software has become a huge business in itself. As the report notes: “Over the intervening years, automation has come to pervade almost every step in the recruiting process: applicant tracking systems, candidate relationship management, scheduling, background checks, sourcing candidates, and assessments. The global recruitment technology market had grown to $1.75 billion by 2017 and is expected to nearly double, to $3.1 billion, by 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwcmIf"&gt;Despite this, companies seem well aware of these problems. Nearly nine out of 10 executives surveyed for the report said they knew automated software was mistakenly filtering out viable candidates, with some saying they were exploring alternate ways to hire candidates. But, as the study’s authors note, fixing these problems will require “overhauling many aspects of the hiring system,” from where companies look for candidates in the first place to how they deploy software in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sims 4 Spa Day update adds high maintenance Sims and ways to pamper them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-vZ84WTojoy0cJUMEtg23-o86CU=/0x1:1280x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69821131/ts4_hero_md_gp_02_reheat_features_04_7x2_xl.png.adapt.crop16x9.767w.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Maxis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ayoVnv"&gt;The Sims 4’s Spa Day Game Pack, which was first released over six years ago in 2015, is receiving a free update this week that adds nail designs created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EbonixSims/status/1433845861231038464"&gt;modder Ebonix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/packs/game-packs/the-sims-4-spa-day?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-spa-day-tw&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cid=69886&amp;amp;ts=1630707803274#initialFeatures"&gt;The update&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available on September 7th, adds a host of other features including a new “High Maintenance” trait and the ability for child Sims to do yoga and meditation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr2yL5"&gt;There are also new options to get manicures, pedicures, and facial masks, and Sims can earn money by teaching mindfulness, developer Maxis says. Sims can now aspire to be a “Zen Guru,” “Self-Care Specialist,” or simply seek out “Inner Peace.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBQb16"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So not only do I have a Simself in an OFFICIAL &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheSims?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheSims&lt;/a&gt; Trailer, but I also worked with them to create these beautiful nails for the Spa Day Refresh!      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Y'all... I HAVE CONTENT IN THE SIMS. FOREVER!!! YOU AIN'T NEVER GETTING RID OF ME NOW!!!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/7kTR78piKN"&gt;https://t.co/7kTR78piKN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/qcQvi1qcGi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qcQvi1qcGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ° •ebonix• ° (@EbonixSims) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EbonixSims/status/1433845861231038464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dDgOyp"&gt;Danielle “EbonixSims” Udo is a veteran modder of The Sims who has made significant contributions to the game’s ability to create diverse Sims. Ebonix, as well as other modders like Amira “Xmiramira” Virgil &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sims-mods-black-creators-customization/"&gt;have been credited&lt;/a&gt; with adding new skin tones and hairstyles for Black sims, creating diversity options that were sorely lacking from the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2J1ZV"&gt;The update comes a little over a year after executive producer and general manager of The Sims, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SimGuruLyndsay/status/1293339102981402624"&gt;Lyndsay Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, pledged that Maxis would be doing more to improve the game’s options for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/12/21364810/the-sims-4-black-skin-tones-representation-ea"&gt;creating diverse Sims&lt;/a&gt;, and that it would be working with community members “&lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/october-skin-tones-update"&gt;to make sure we get this right.&lt;/a&gt;” These included the addition of “&lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/october-skin-tones-update"&gt;at least a hundred&lt;/a&gt;” new skin tone swatches, new makeup options, and updates to the game’s hairstyles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKnJhm"&gt;“Inclusivity is at the core of The Sims franchise,” Pearson said at the time. “From the beginning, we set out to let you build Sims that look like you, or people you know. And we understand it doesn’t feel like we’re truly living up to that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hSIyc"&gt;The Spa Day refresh is coming to PC, Mac, Xbox One, and PS4, and will be available free to anyone who already owns the game pack. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUy8f0"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, Texas now has a law that makes it illegal for anyone to help women get an abortion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;after six weeks of pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; with no exceptions for rape or incest — and to take advantage of that, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life encouraged citizens to report those people at a dedicated “whistleblower” website, promising to “ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1Bpif"&gt;As of Sunday, that dedicated website now appears to be no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLQOwQ"&gt;On Friday, Texas Right to Life had to find a new home on the web for the site, because hosting provider GoDaddy gave the group 24 hours to find an alternative. “We have informed prolifewhistleblower.com they have 24 hours to move to another provider for violating our terms of service,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/texas-abortion-law-website-tiktok.html"&gt;a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VEtx"&gt;By late Friday, it appeared it found that home: Epik, the provider that also helped save &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;controversial sites Gab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;social media platform Parler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban"&gt;internet hate forum 8chan&lt;/a&gt; when other web service providers wouldn’t take them, is now listed as the registrar and name server provider for prolifewhistleblower.com as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssajkq"&gt;But the site may have gone too far for any web provider to touch, even Epik. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOoXhR"&gt;Initially, GoDaddy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the whistleblower site violated “multiple provisions” of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Flegal%2Fagreements%2Funiversal-terms-of-service-agreement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22656196%2Fgodaddy-texas-right-for-life-abortion-whistleblowing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; including Section 5.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uQcvnG"&gt;You will not collect or harvest (or permit anyone else to collect or harvest) any User Content (as defined below) or any non-public or personally identifiable information about another User or any other person or entity without their express prior written consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VdDqlT"&gt;After Epik stepped in, the website still had plenty of trouble staying online. As of 4AM ET Saturday, we saw HTTP 503 error codes when trying to access it. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas anti-abortion group tried to use Digital Ocean as a hosting provider first, but may have fallen afoul of that provider’s rules as well, and it’s not hosted there anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQuANi"&gt;On Saturday, the site appeared to have migrated to BitMitigate, a webhost owned by Epik itself, and one that specifically advertises &lt;a href="https://bitmitigate.com/sovereign-hosting.html"&gt;its “sovereign hosting” services&lt;/a&gt; for platforms under attack. Yet by Saturday evening, the site was not loading for us at all, throwing an “accessed a banned URL” error. Epik says it informed Texas Right to Life that hosting the anonymous tip form was against its terms of service, general counsel Daniel Prince told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUniis"&gt;By Sunday, the battle appeared to be over: prolifewhistleblower.com now redirects to Texas Right to Life’s primary website, instead of a form that allows citizens to inform on their neighbors. Epik takes credit for this, saying it “persuaded them to stop collecting anonymous tips and to take it off the internet entirely.” We’re checking that with Texas Right to Life now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zw3kD"&gt;The anti-abortion group’s website had been under siege for days even before the web provider scuffle, with angry protesters flooding it with fake tips — including at least one fake claim that Texas governor Greg Abbott himself had violated the law, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. One activist on TikTok even created a script that can automatically feed fake reports into the website’s tipbox, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. He told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that the automated tools he’d created had received over 15,000 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qc5bIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21/video/7000057713975725318" data-video-id="7000057713975725318" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@black_madness21" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21"&gt;@black_madness21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @black_madness21 &lt;a title="texas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texas"&gt;#texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="abortion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/abortion"&gt;#abortion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gregabbott" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gregabbott"&gt;#gregabbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sean Black" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7000057554395007750"&gt;♬ original sound - Sean Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ1vqM"&gt;But on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293"&gt;Gizmodo’s Shoshana Wodinsky suggested another way for activists to protest&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the whistle on Texas Right to Life itself, by complaining to GoDaddy about what it was doing. That’s what appears to have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxPLM"&gt;It’s not the first time web hosting providers or even GoDaddy specifically have played this role: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18036520/gab-down-godaddy-domain-blocked"&gt;Gab.com had to find a new home in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and GoDaddy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320086/godaddy-domain-registrar-richard-spencer-altright-com-offline"&gt;took down white nationalist Richard Spencer’s Altright.com&lt;/a&gt; that May. Neo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer was similarly given 24 hours by GoDaddy to find a new home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142384/daily-stormer-site-go-daddy-hosting-providers-hackers-anonymous"&gt;in August 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban"&gt;moving to the dark web&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gab was able to return, though, and Texas Right to Life at least briefly did as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mUtk1j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the alt-right can’t build an alt-internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/21/16180614/charlottesville-daily-stormer-alt-right-internet-domain"},{"title":"Why banning hate sites is so hard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757267/8chan-offline-hate-sites-internet-problems-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio-cloudflare"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tkF776"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 4:36PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context from GoDaddy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFf3gR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 4th, 4AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Epik appears to be Texas Right to Life’s new home for its site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28LVF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 5th, 12:18AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the site now appears to be down, following a report that even Epik wasn’t willing to host the whistleblower form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXqcnf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 5th, 10:29PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the website no longer exists, redirecting to the anti-abortion group’s main site instead, and additional Epik context.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Moonfall, The Wheel of Time, Belfast, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LC4yVkwcD86M7AtJKSQtLyHcmpw=/148x0:1317x779/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69820233/halle_berry_moondall.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Halle Berry stars in Moonfall | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbsmbr4HFM&amp;amp;ab_channel=LionsgateMovies" target="_blank"&gt;Lionsgate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IP0fda"&gt;I have to say I’m really appreciating what&lt;em&gt; Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; is doing in season 2, and this week’s episode had some really great work from Jason Sudeikis and Sarah Niles. I won’t spoil it, but it was remarkable how the couch scene, which would have been just another “Ted being loopy” scene played for comic effect in season one hit completely different now that Ted’s realized he needs help with his mental health. Also, I recommend this &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/arts/television/ted-lasso-sarah-niles.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;profile of Niles&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a few weeks old but nicely captures how she sees Dr. Sharon fitting in with the rest of the Lasso team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFz9hZ"&gt;Now on to this week’s teasers and trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8xzRi3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRbsmbr4HFM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fjlSpX"&gt;Moonfall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="h4yOZR"&gt;“What if the moon fell to earth” is the premise of this Roland Emmerich flick, which looks like about what you’d expect from the director of &lt;em&gt;Independence Day &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Day After Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;— loud, lots of action, and a desperate band of heroes who nobody takes seriously but who have to save the world. Oh and guess what: according to the official description “our Moon is not what we think it is.” Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson, Michael Pena, John Bradley, and Donald Sutherland star in &lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt;, which is due in theaters February 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rgwIw1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Fus4Xb_TLg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="08kMYz"&gt;The Wheel of Time &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FLTmwq"&gt;This series is yet another long-awaited production that was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but is finally coming to Amazon Prime Video. Based on the series of books started by the late Robert Jordan (which was finished by Brandon Sanderson), &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Rosamund Pike’s Moraine, a member of the powerful all-female Aes Sedai organization, as she leads a group of five young people on a journey around the world, one of whom will fulfill the prophecy of the Dragon Reborn. The first three episodes of&lt;em&gt; The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; arrive on Amazon Prime Video November 19th, with new episodes dropping weekly on Fridays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NzoVHG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_gD9-Oa0fg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NxSbUO"&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="eIu5cX"&gt;I’ve lost track of how many trailers and teasers have come out for the latest James Bond movie, whose US theatrical release date as of this moment is October 8th. It very likely could get pushed back again. In &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, 007 is recruited back into active service to help find a missing scientist, and runs into a terrorist leader bent on revenge. Daniel Craig (in what he’s said will be his last outing as Bond), Rami Malek, Lea Seydoux, Jeffrey Wright, Naomie Harris, Christoph Waltz, and Ralph Fiennes star in &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wz2SFv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja3PPOnJQ2k?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AoIiBX"&gt;Belfast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo371J"&gt;Kenneth Branagh wrote and directed this coming-of-age story set in the Irish city during the late 1960s, when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles"&gt;The Troubles&lt;/a&gt; began. It’s already getting &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/awards/awards/belfast-telluride-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-caitronia-balfe-1235055790/"&gt;Oscar buzz&lt;/a&gt;, which seems warranted given its all-star cast. Caitriona Balfe, Judi Dench, Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, and Jude Hill star in &lt;em&gt;Belfast&lt;/em&gt;, due in theaters November 12th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefly releases video and more details about its Alpha rocket that exploded mid-flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYk-zYSpbfW55DPFVxIaKzkcBs8=/164x0:1601x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69820093/firefly_rocket.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket takes off from Vandenberg Space Force base  on September 3rd | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFjoPw0CfAU&amp;amp;ab_channel=FireflyAerospace" target="_blank"&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ysIVmH"&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655687/firefly-alpha-rocket-explodes-space-force-first-launch"&gt;exploded mid-flight&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, but the company posted a new video on Sunday and provided more detail on what happened.  “Although the vehicle didn’t make orbit, the day marked a major advancement for our team,” the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Firefly_Space/status/1434596618485911554"&gt;company tweeted.&lt;/a&gt; “We demonstrated we ‘arrived’ as a company capable of building and launching rockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWoqdW"&gt;Alpha, a two-stage rocket, lifted off from the Vandenberg Space Force base in California at 9:59PM ET on Thursday, carrying a payload of private satellites. It was the company’s first-ever mission, and two minutes after liftoff the rocket began tipping horizontally, falling short of reaching its maximum aerodynamic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7HGGW"&gt;According to Firefly, the rocket cleared the launch pad successfully, but about 15 seconds into flight, engine 2 shut down. The vehicle continued its climb and was able to maintain control for about 145 seconds, Firefly said, but the climb rate was slow because it was lacking the thrust of one of its four engines (the one that shut down). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zBTsNE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFjoPw0CfAU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="id__q88hhly6pk8"&gt;“The vehicle was challenged to maintain control without the thrust vectoring of engine 2. Alpha was able to compensate at subsonic speeds, but as it moved through transonic and into supersonic flight, where control is most challenging, the three engine thrust vector control was insufficient and the vehicle tumbled out of control,” according to Firefly. “The range terminated the flight using the explosive Flight Termination System (FTS). The rocket did not explode on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__pprp9i9g7yn"&gt;It’s investigating why engine 2 shut down early, and says it will report the root cause once it’s completed the investigation. “In collaboration with the FAA and our partners at Space Launch Delta 30, we’ll return to conduct Alpha Flight 2 as soon as possible,” the company tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__txen3y4m9ib"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
