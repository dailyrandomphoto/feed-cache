    <title>UK’s first electric-only car charging station opens for business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZOLIHROcZEMN20LozELAdZ0R5sU=/1x0:1024x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68469118/Gridserve_BT_EF_12_11_5_1024x682.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The site is located near Braintree, in Essex.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gridserve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BDVqyv"&gt;The UK’s first all-electric car charging station opened today near Braintree in Essex, marking a milestone in the country’s transition away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles. The station is &lt;a href="https://www.gridserve.com/2020/12/06/gridserve-opens-uks-first-electric-forecourt/"&gt;operated by Gridserve&lt;/a&gt;, and is the first of more than 100 locations it plans to build over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi7p8X"&gt;The location consists of 36 electric vehicle chargers, delivering up to 350kW of power. That’s enough to provide 200 miles of range in 20 minutes, according to Gridserve. With an initial cost of £0.24 per kWh of energy, the company estimates an average-sized electric vehicle can be charged from 20 to 80 percent for under £10 (less than $13.25). Gridserve claims these are the “lowest ultra-high power charging rates on the market today.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jarddFt4bYbVgnnW6fOkYzNp__I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150206/Gridserve_BT_EF_12_11_11_1024x682.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gridserve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar panels at the station provide renewable energy to its 36 chargers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xB7fUC"&gt;The station’s chargers draw power from renewable sources, including solar panels installed on the station’s canopies, and the company’s network of hybrid solar farms. There’s also a 6MWh battery onsite to help balance the supply of power during peak times. According to Gridserve, “on windy winter nights the battery can store enough energy to drive 24,000 miles in electric vehicles the following day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA5t5E"&gt;The station has opened less than a month after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans for the country to ban the sale of new combustion engine vehicles by 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/17/boris-johnson-announces-10-point-green-plan-with-250000-jobs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, with some hybrid cars and vans continuing to be sold until 2035. One forecast cited in a &lt;a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7480/"&gt;recent government report&lt;/a&gt; estimated that there could be over 10 million electric cars on British roads by 2030, rising to 36 million a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7eBNj"&gt;Although this is the UK’s first all-electric charging station, it’s not the first we’ve seen globally. Last year, for example, a gas station in Maryland in the US replaced its traditional fuel pumps with four electric vehicle charging points. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/first-gas-station-to-ditch-oil-for-electric-vehicle-charging-now-open.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that this made it the first gas station in the country to ditch oil in favor of 100 percent electric vehicle charging.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Floyd Mayweather is fighting Logan Paul in February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WriFZ7F05tFYEpCNYIYpt_lTHqA=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68468465/paulmayweather.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6HY5q"&gt;YouTuber Logan Paul has struck a deal to fight former boxing megastar Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a “special exhibition” match on February 20th. The bout will be streamed as a &lt;a href="https://fanmio.com/products/floyd-mayweather-vs-logan-paul-special-exhibition-fight"&gt;pay-per-view on Fanmio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljDODc"&gt;Mayweather is an undefeated champion with a 50-0 record, multiple world titles in five weight classes, and an Olympic bronze medal. Paul is best known for his controversial YouTube video where he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16875188/logan-paul-aokigahara-suicide-forest-japan"&gt;filmed a dead body in a Japanese forest&lt;/a&gt;. He has fought in one sanctioned boxing match: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785762/logan-paul-ksi-fight-winner-result-youtube"&gt;a loss to fellow YouTuber KSI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PlkG7"&gt;Needless to say, this is unlikely to be a festival of evenly matched athletic prowess. But Mayweather is not above signing up to farcical contests for the spectacle and the payday. His 50th official win involved him coming out of retirement in 2017 to face UFC star Conor McGregor, who had never professionally boxed before. The following year he fought kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in a widely panned exhibition match, winning by TKO in the first round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eFPcV1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"We talked to Jake Paul, who is currently going Super Saiyan","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21721881/jake-paul-interview-youtube-boxing-nate-robinson-ppv-controversy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SAMpSQ"&gt;Mayweather called out Logan Paul last month &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FloydMayweather/status/1329295858521706497"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, making his thoughts on boxing YouTubers clear and saying he’s “not the one for the kid games.” Paul’s brother, Jake, responded to Mayweather’s comments ahead of his own fight against former NBA player Nate Robinson, which he ended up winning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhAijp"&gt;“You know, it doesn’t bother me,” Jake &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtuber-jake-paul-believes-covid-is-a-hoaxand-i-am-fake-news"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day, he’s like 5-foot-4, so he’s actually the little kid here, and obviously he just wants attention. He’s fifty-something years old. He should be in retirement. So he just wants to get relevancy by talking about the YouTube kids, because we’re the ones popping off right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0BDQg"&gt;(Mayweather is actually 5-foot-8 and 43 years old. Also very good at boxing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa42Qr"&gt;The whole situation is deeply silly, which is no doubt why organizers expect a lot of people to tune in. The “early pricing” of $24.99 only applies to the first million PPV sales, with the price rising to $39.99, then $59.99 on December 29th, then $69.99 from February 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Marksman, The Dig, The Mauritanian, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2jQpGT-1NIgeSCfDlJTDiUCDck=/241x0:1312x714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68467493/liam_neeson.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liam Neeson stars in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.themarksmanmovie.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marksman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mQn71j"&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;The Undoing &lt;/em&gt;and while it was disappointingly messy with a plot that didn’t quite come together, I think we can all agree that 1) &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/11/look-at-nicole-kidmans-fabulous-coats-on-the-undoing.html"&gt;Nicole Kidman’s coats&lt;/a&gt; were amazing and 2) Hugh Grant should absolutely play more villains. I’m also kind of on a kick of catching up on shows I missed because I didn’t have premium cable, and just started season one of &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt; (I know, I know). Still deciding what I think but as I’m sure has been observed by many others, Carrie is very intense! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvlCZZ"&gt;New trailers this week include Liam Neeson in &lt;em&gt;The Marksman&lt;/em&gt; and Ralph Fiennes in &lt;em&gt;The Dig&lt;/em&gt; (big “the” theme this week), and I managed to find five non-holiday flicks for you (you’re welcome). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bn8w8W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CURfgGd3ACw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fqpH5r"&gt;The Marksman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l6rmAc"&gt;At some point, will Liam Neeson get a break from heroically &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/vi654818073?playlistId=tt0936501&amp;amp;ref_=tt_ov_vi"&gt;rescuing innocent victims&lt;/a&gt; from bloodthirsty bad guys? Maybe, but not in &lt;em&gt;The Marksman&lt;/em&gt;. He plays Jim Hanson, a down-on-his-luck retired Marine living near the US-Mexico border. He inadvertently gets caught up with a drug cartel hunting a young boy trying to make his way to family in Chicago. &lt;em&gt;The Marksman&lt;/em&gt; is due in theaters January 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gJbDy0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gENO66DUgaQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hrM8fq"&gt;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EqFFzf"&gt;Season 4 of Netflix’s series about our favorite teenage witch is back, with Kiernan Shipka returning as Sabrina. This time around, she has to deal with baddies who can warp reality, which, side note: maybe altering reality is not a always bad thing (looking at you, 2020). &lt;em&gt;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Part 4, &lt;/em&gt;debuts on Netflix December 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5eS6Xl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZQz0rkNajo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AZw51I"&gt;The Dig &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cxo5fB"&gt;Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan star as an amateur archaeologist and wealthy widow, respectively, who excavate a mysterious burial mound in England on the eve of World War II. It’s based on the true story of the 1939 excavation of an &lt;a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/death-and-memory/anglo-saxon-ship-burial-sutton-hoo"&gt;Anglo-Saxon ship buried&lt;/a&gt; near Sutton Hoo. &lt;em&gt;The Dig&lt;/em&gt; arrives in theaters and on Netflix January 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZaZsP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7tmxxzZXLEM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lKaAcL"&gt;The Mauritanian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ddAysW"&gt;Another film based on a true story, &lt;em&gt;The Mauritanian&lt;/em&gt; stars Jodie Foster as an attorney representing a man who was imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay for 14 years. Benedict Cumberbatch (brace yourself for the accent), Tahar Rahim, and Shailene Woodley also star. &lt;em&gt;The Mauritanian&lt;/em&gt; is slated for theaters February 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FU2U5f"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omn2PJEuOTw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0ugOlp"&gt;We Can Be Heroes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ICoEZD"&gt;In this sequel of sorts to &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl&lt;/em&gt;, a group of superkids team up to rescue their superparents from alien invaders. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, &lt;em&gt;We Can Be Heroes&lt;/em&gt; stars Pedro Pascal, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Christian Slater, and Yaya Gosselin. It’s coming soon to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aptera is back with a new EV it says doesn’t need charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjKWeYIunNo_ZEv1SY5Rm7zqi1I=/2x0:1072x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68466814/aptera.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aptera is taking pre-orders for its new solar electric vehicle&lt;/em&gt; | Aptera&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m7z3r3"&gt;Aptera, the company that shuttered in 2011 after failing to secure funding for its three-wheeled electric car, is back with a new solar electric vehicle it claims never needs charging, at least, for most drivers. And it predicts its top model, with a battery of 100 kWh, can get up to 1,000 miles of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5Yw6"&gt;The new three-wheeled, two-person (or two adults plus pet, as &lt;a href="https://da08ff99-fd1e-4a74-a1ff-5a92f149508f.filesusr.com/ugd/312682_ed4aa901f9314a20a3e0a3aabee2cc09.pdf"&gt;its specs suggest&lt;/a&gt;) vehicle has a solar roof array that can provide up to 45 miles of range per day, so if you have that top model and add the charge from the solar panels while it’s parked, then the 1,000 range seems ... possible. Although, as &lt;a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34875659/aptera-ev-solar-no-charging-revealed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle doesn’t run just on solar power while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BS1QhK0DwVMit42Nu9esO6lyVmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22148935/aptera_interior.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Aptera&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interior of Aptera’s new electric vehicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBiJhV"&gt;“With Aptera’s Never Charge technology, you are driven by the power of the sun. Our built-in solar array keeps your battery pack topped off and anywhere you want to go, you just go,” Aptera co-founder Chris Anthony &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aptera-reveals-first-never-charge-solar-vehicle-301186654.html"&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Never Charge is built into every Aptera and is designed to harvest enough sunlight to travel over 11,000 miles per year in most regions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAUzaL"&gt;The vehicle is curvy and lightweight, according to the images and spec sheet, and it has a drag coefficient of just 0.13 (by way of comparison, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/the-tesla-model-3-reviewed-finally"&gt;Tesla’s Model 3&lt;/a&gt; has a drag coefficient of 0.23, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502032/volkswagen-id4-electric-suv-first-drive-vw"&gt;Volkswagen’s ID 4 electric SUV&lt;/a&gt; is at 0.28). Its front-wheel drive vehicle can go from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds, and its three-wheel drive model can get to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7OY8aP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbLQ6Z0u_qo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VLA3Wz"&gt;Preorders for Aptera’s Paradigm and Paradigm Plus models are &lt;a href="https://www.aptera.us/"&gt;open now&lt;/a&gt;, for a refundable deposit of $100. The price will range between $25,900 and $46,000— or more for customized vehicles—and the company expects to deliver them in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QMj5n"&gt;Back in 2011, Aptera shut down after it was &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-07-aptera-no-production-vehicles-until-we-get-funding-from-the-go.html"&gt;unable to secure a $150 million loan&lt;/a&gt; to produce its Aptera 2e, which was &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/30/aptera-2e-three-wheeler-deemed-a-car-by-the-doe-eligible-for-fu/"&gt;certified by the US Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;. President and CEO Paul Wilbur said at the time that the company had “contributed new technologies to build a future for more efficient driving.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QbU21Z"&gt;This past week I’ve been watching eBay, trying to decide if I should sell my PS5. I wouldn’t dream of becoming a scalper, but it’s getting hard to ignore just how much it’s worth. My daughter and I had beaten &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, so I thought I’d peek at the resale market. Wow, are they worth a lot! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6mp4T"&gt;And it’s not just the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; — I found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X and S&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;3080&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;3070&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; graphics cards, and AMD’s rival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; GPUs are all commanding incredibly high prices on the resale market. It no longer surprises me how each big ticket holiday gaming gadget sells out nigh-instantly anytime they’re restocked; the incentive for scalpers is just too high. They’re so high even folks like me, who bought one intending to use it, might have to think twice. (That's capitalism for you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM1f94"&gt;Example: The full-fat PlayStation 5 with a disc drive retails for $499.99. But it’s easily worth &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; that on eBay&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;averaged the actual final sale price of a hundred PS5s, subtracting a few sketchy outliers, to arrive at a street price of &lt;strong&gt;$1,024&lt;/strong&gt;. Mind you, that’s not the asking price: that’s what people are actually paying for these consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T37jXd"&gt;I ran the same numbers for the PS5 Digital Edition, the new Xboxes and all six graphics cards. Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7ste80"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10207195"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GNqZqB"&gt;I didn’t weed out any open-box or used consoles to get to these numbers, and you can easily see how strong the PS5’s demand is in particular: even the PS5 Digital Edition (without the disc drive) is worth nearly as much as the disc version that retails for $100 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJbU5F"&gt;While scanning through, I also saw that including extra games, controllers or accessories isn't even necessary: sometimes it was enough to justify an extra $100 or $200, but a PS5 didn’t need one to rake in $1K or more. (Some Xboxes with extra accessories seemed to be worth $50 to $100 more than others, but people are clearly buying for the consoles themselves.) All this means unless the situation changes drastically, the scalping isn’t going to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oaTsl"&gt;If there’s a bright spot for would-be console buyers, it’s that not every PS5 and Xbox listed on eBay is actually selling, even if quite a few are. In terms of volume, the PS5 and new Xboxes each moved around 1,000 units on eBay on December 3rd alone, but some $1,000 PS5 and $850 Xbox Series X listings ran out the clock without getting sold. (Most PS5 Digital Edition and Xbox Series S seemed to be selling, but there were also far fewer of them listed than the disc-based models.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MezkBm"&gt;On the PC side of things, the new Nvidia and AMD graphics cards appear to be in incredibly short supply judging by eBay listings, though. Almost every single card I saw found a buyer, save the most exorbitantly priced RTX 3090s — and even there, there were a handful of $2,400 and $2,500 sales for what’s nominally a $1,500 GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_6QbSK-QZd8ca4tkVQn_pOm_2FA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989909/twarren_201025_4262_0008.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Unh7cL"&gt;The shortages feel very real: maybe a hundred RTX 3080 cards changed hands on December 3rd, even fewer RTX 3070 cards, and only 27 of the new AMD cards trickled down to eBay buyers that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLapNY"&gt;As we’ve discussed repeatedly at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, all of these items are practically impossible to buy at an actual store for their retail price right now. Unless you’re lucky, have connections, or are willing to pay for bots or scalpers, you might not be able to find one at all — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;retailers have don't have the right incentives to fix that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgCN3O"&gt;We like to think we’ve got some fast, savvy dealhunters on staff, but many of us are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564282/ps5-sony-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-orders-launch-week"&gt;still struggling&lt;/a&gt; to find a new GPU, PS5, or Xbox. Each and every supposed opportunity to buy is another shitshow. “Coming soon” is almost always immediately followed by “Out of stock,” and if we actually manage to get one into our digital shopping cart in that blink of an eye, it’ll often vanish before checkout. The December 2nd launch of the Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti was no exception, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-3060-ti-launch-is-another-disappointment"&gt;with retailers failing to launch at the scheduled time and others gone before they actually appeared to be in stock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGFb9o"&gt;Best Buy was a particular joy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9YJPxd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Annnd they yanked it right out of my cart. Great shopping experience once again, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BestBuy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@BestBuy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hycn1LoGXW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hycn1LoGXW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1334167428872343555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eNKhvi"&gt;It’s also fun to see GameStop and Newegg “restock” these products — where “restock” means &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Newegg/status/1334647866111848450"&gt;upselling us on bundles with unwanted extras&lt;/a&gt;. Can you blame them, though, when eBay shows even those buyers could get their money's worth based on the current supply and demand? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47YRMa"&gt;This pattern has played out many times before, and it's likely that supply will eventually catch up. Usually, these companies don't intentionally create scarcity, even if it felt like that to me in early 2008 when I camped out in a freezing Best Buy parking lot for a Nintendo Wii a full year &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; that console launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPXogL"&gt;But we are living through unprecedented times right now, with companies like Microsoft and Nvidia signaling it may be months before things even out. I can't remember a holiday season with this many must-have items, either: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickle_Me_Elmo#1996_Elmo_craze"&gt;Tickle Me Elmo&lt;/a&gt;, early Power Rangers and that Nintendo Wii were typically one-offs! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIrt6G"&gt;I’m still leaning against selling my PS5 on eBay; I just like the idea of trading it for an AMD RX 6800, like I suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;in my review&lt;/a&gt;. But it's no easier to find that GPU than it was to find a PS5; it looks like I'd need most of the gains I'd see from selling the console to buy that graphics card on eBay, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOeY97"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPn9PC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y1qf5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm33Q3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this NY Times report about how police departments are using drones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aE0wlUME_5njitSQY6R7_YPLtX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68466277/vpavic_190930_3698_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bMJkuY"&gt;As drones get smarter and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;issues more waivers&lt;/a&gt; for its drone regulations, we’re likely to see more law enforcement agencies using them in their day-to-day, including for 911 calls. The formidable &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cademetz"&gt;Cade Metz&lt;/a&gt; writes for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; about what this looks like in practice, and to be perfectly honest, it’s extremely disconcerting, as Chula Vista, California officers “chase” a “suspect” using a drone: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IvTYWH"&gt;When the man left the car, carrying a gun and a bag of heroin, a nearby police car had trouble following as he sprinted across the street and ducked behind a wall. But as he threw the gun into a dumpster and hid the bag of heroin, the drone, hovering above him, caught everything on camera. When he slipped through the back door of a strip mall, exited through the front door and ran down the sidewalk, it caught that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4LLxK"&gt;Watching the live video feed, an officer back at headquarters relayed the details to the police on the scene, who soon caught the man and took him into custody&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FKOiq8"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, the Chula Vista police department uses drones on around 15 emergency calls a day, part of its Drone as First Responder program. In July, the Chula Vista PD &lt;a href="https://medium.com/skydio/celebrating-chula-vistas-close-proximity-low-altitude-bvlos-waiver-d3f969c4b900"&gt;received approval&lt;/a&gt; to fly its Skydio drones beyond visual line of sight in emergency situations, but with conditions: It couldn’t fly higher than 50 feed above the nearest obstacle, had to stay within 1,500 feet of the pilot, and had to return to visual line of sight “as soon as practical” (however, that the drones used in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ example above were DJI drones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeTerK"&gt;Budget cuts for police departments are looming as local governments try to weather the economic downturn of the coronavirus pandemic. There’s also the push toward reexamining how police departments are funded, and drones provide a more cost-effective option than helicopters and pilots, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article notes. Plus, the drones can allow for “policing” that adheres to social distancing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzVfXD"&gt;But as a policy analyst with the ACLU told the Times, the privacy concerns are considerable. Technology like drones “could allow law enforcement to enforce any area of the law against anyone they want.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxGp1G"&gt;To read more about how police departments can use drones and the myriad issues involved, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/technology/police-drones.html"&gt;unsettling report in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX has launched a second Dragon capsule to the space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRxxnM0QsuRkmAHctjLJPxFBzHE=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68466117/CRS21_rollout_DSC_3152_scaled_1024x683.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Cargo Dragon spacecraft will launch Sunday from Kennedy Space Center&lt;/em&gt; | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hRt61C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 6th, 11:35AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: SpaceX successfully launched its latest mission to the International Space Station, using its upgraded Dragon capsule that will dock with the station tomorrow at about 1:30PM ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsCAa8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original story:&lt;/strong&gt; This morning, SpaceX is set to launch its latest batch of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station, but the company is using a slightly different spacecraft for this flight than resupply missions of the past. SpaceX is flying its newly upgraded Dragon capsule to transport the goods to space — the same vehicle that the company has been using to fly astronauts to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcVz1Z"&gt;SpaceX has been resupplying the space station since 2012, and for all of its 20 previous missions, the company has used the original version of its Dragon cargo capsule. SpaceX started developing a new Dragon capsule, though, to transport people to and from the ISS. Called Crew Dragon — or Dragon 2 — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;vehicle carried its first crew to space in May&lt;/a&gt;. With the new version operational, SpaceX decided to discontinue the use of its old Dragon capsule and use the upgraded version to carry both crew &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spQaCZ"&gt;The Dragon 2 capsule sports a number of upgrades over its predecessor; SpaceX says it can carry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1334502617465069575?s=20"&gt;50 percent more science payloads.&lt;/a&gt; The new Dragon is also capable of automatically docking with the space station. The previous version had to be berthed: it would slowly approach the ISS, while a crew member on board the station would use a robotic arm to grab the incoming capsule and move it onto an open docking port. Dragon 2 doesn’t need any help from humans to dock and attach itself to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eXjHM"&gt;This mission will bring supplies for the station and astronauts, and is also bringing several experiments to the ISS. They include the European Space Agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2019/09/BioAsteroid"&gt;Bioasteroid,&lt;/a&gt; which will test how biomining— the process of using microorganisms to extract elements from rocks— is affected by microgravity. The mission also will have the first &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/COVID-19_drug_research_and_bio-mining_launching_to_the_International_Space_Station"&gt;COVID-19 drug research experiment&lt;/a&gt; in space on board, to try to improve the efficiency of antiviral drug remdesivir. Also on board will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437672/nanoracks-bishop-commercial-airlock-spacex-international-space-station-satellite-deployment"&gt;Nanorocks’ commercial airlock module&lt;/a&gt;— basically a large metal cup that attaches to the exterior of the ISS— designed to get payloads and other materials from inside the pressurized environment of the ISS out into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0FBs2T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dcy4yZb13fE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pue6YM"&gt;Once this capsule reaches the space station, it won’t be the only Dragon attached to the ISS. On November 15th, SpaceX launched a crew of four to the ISS on another Dragon capsule, which docked with the station a day later. That means there will be two Dragons docked at the ISS after this flight gets off the ground. “It’ll be the first time that there are two Dragons on the space station simultaneously,” Sarah Walker, the director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of the flight. “And it really ushers in a season of continuous Dragon presence for the near future, at least through the end of 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBEaeW"&gt;The mission was rescheduled due to weather concerns but is now slated to launch at 11:17AM ET from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX is using one of its used Falcon 9 rockets for the mission, a vehicle that’s flown three times before. In fact, it’s the same rocket that launched SpaceX’s first crew of two the station in May. After the flight, the Falcon 9 will attempt to land on one of SpaceX’s drone ships in the Atlantic. The Dragon capsule is expected to dock with the ISS on December 7th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s Chang’e 5 completes docking mission on its way back to Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo taken at Beijing Aerospace Control Center BACC in Beijing on Dec. 3, 2020 shows the ascender of Chang’e-5 spacecraft flying above the lunar surface. The Chinese spacecraft carrying the country’s first lunar samples blasted off from the moon late Thursday, the China National Space Administration announced.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jj58S2"&gt;China’s Chang’e-5 mission completed a tricky docking maneuver on Saturday, as it prepares to return the soil samples it collected from the Moon’s surface back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f24fkD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594565/china-change-5-mission-lunar-sample-return-long-march-5-launch"&gt;Chang’e 5 launched on November 23rd&lt;/a&gt; atop a Long March 5 rocket, with four main spacecraft. The mission entered the lunar orbit on November 28th, and its lander and ascent vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21724067/china-lunar-mission-change-5-moon-soil-samples"&gt;landed on the Moon December 1st&lt;/a&gt;, while its service module remained in lunar orbit. The lander gathered rocks and soil, and on Saturday, docked in orbit with the service module. Those samples will now be put in a return capsule for the trip home, expected to land in Inner Mongolia later in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiC6c9"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WB7JIs"&gt;If the mission is successful, it will make China only the third country to return samples from the Moon, more than 50 years after the US Apollo missions. The last successful lunar sample return mission was the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLWMtW"&gt;Also on Saturday, Japan’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155825/jaxa-hayabusa2-mission-asteroid-sample-return-landing-australia"&gt;Hayabusa2 mission landed in the Australian desert&lt;/a&gt;, after retrieving samples of the Ryugu asteroid. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBgUYr"&gt;Tesla published its first-ever diversity report on Friday, which shows the automaker’s US leadership is 83 percent male, and 59 percent white. The &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/us-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-report"&gt;Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Impact report&lt;/a&gt; shows that men represent 79 percent of Tesla’s workforce, and women 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s92IPH"&gt;“While women are historically underrepresented in the tech and automotive industries, we recognize we have work to do in this area,” the report states. “Increasing women’s representation at all levels, especially in leadership, is a top priority in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMJNJx"&gt;The company also acknowledges in the report that Black employees are underrepresented— only 10 percent of the workforce and 4 percent of leadership at Tesla are Black or African-American. “We know that our numbers do not represent the deep talent pools of Black and African American talent that exist in the US at every level,” the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AOAAF"&gt;The company says Black and African-American employees made up 12 percent of new hires at the company in 2020, which is a 9 percent increase from 2019. It plans to conduct more recruitment at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and provide its managers and recruiters with unconscious bias training, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cj6A3"&gt;Asian employees make up 21 percent of Tesla’s workforce and 25 percent of company leadership, and Hispanic or Latino/Latina employees represent 22 percent of its total workforce, but only 4 percent of leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRS0jg"&gt;Tesla’s report is somewhat incomplete, however; it does not detail attrition or retention rates at the company, or provide details about how many of its employees identify as non-binary or gender nonconforming, or, how many identify as having a disability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfKni"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX4zTb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1cExQ8"&gt;After spending six years in space, a Japanese spacecraft just landed in the desert of southern Australia, bringing a small cache of asteroid rocks to the surface of Earth. It’s only the second time in history that materials from an asteroid have been returned to our planet. Eventually, scientists will open the spacecraft up, uncovering the precious rocks within to learn more about the asteroids that permeate our Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vD89BN"&gt;The landing is the culmination of Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission, aimed at bringing samples of an asteroid back to Earth. After launching from Japan in 2014, the Hayabusa2 spacecraft spent four years journeying to an asteroid named Ryugu. The vehicle spent a year and a half hanging around the asteroid, mapping the rock’s surface and grabbing samples of material before heading back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="teSn4G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists are eager to see the rocks that Hayabusa2 has returned&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbETnX"&gt;Scientists are eager to see the rocks that Hayabusa2 has returned, as pristine samples from an asteroid could tell us a lot more about what our Solar System was like when the planets were first forming. That’s because asteroids are a bit like baby pictures of our cosmic neighborhood. These space rocks have been around since the dawn of the Solar System, and scientists believe asteroids haven’t really changed much over the last 4.6 billion years. These objects contain many of the same materials that were present at the Solar System’s birth, so studying these rocks in labs here on Earth could provide key context about the early days of the planets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YXgCBm"&gt;The capsule will be transported to Japan, where we’ll learn how much asteroid material the mission gathered. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which oversees the mission, hoped to bring back 100 milligrams of material from Ryugu, but scientists didn’t have a way to measure how much sample Hayabusa2 had collected while in space. That exact amount will be revealed when the spacecraft is opened in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DS6IWS"&gt;Hayabusa2 used some creative techniques for collecting its samples at Ryugu. Equipped with a small horn-shaped arm, the spacecraft first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234782/jaxa-hayabusa-2-ryugu-asteroid-sample-return-mission"&gt;tapped the asteroid with this appendage in February of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. When the arm made contact, it shot out a bullet-like projectile that punctured the asteroid, releasing a whole mess of dust and pebbles that hopefully went up into the horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="B7JyYD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The spacecraft didn’t just make one sample grab at Ryugu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDkhp"&gt;The spacecraft didn’t just make one sample grab at Ryugu, though. Hayabusa2 tried this maneuver again in July of 2019, but the spacecraft had done a bit of excavating first. Before &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+verge+hayabusa2&amp;amp;oq=the+verge&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j69i59l2j0j69i60l2.1277j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;tapping the asteroid a second time&lt;/a&gt;, the spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295964/japan-spacecraft-asteroid-ryugu-hayabusa2-sci-explosion-crater"&gt;dropped a can of explosives onto Ryugu&lt;/a&gt;, blasting a crater on the asteroid and revealing some of the rocks located just below the surface. Hayabusa2 then tapped the surface inside this crater to scoop up some of this newly exposed material. The goal was to gather even more pristine rocks from Ryugu. The material underneath the asteroid’s surface hasn’t been exposed to the harsh environment of space for billions of years like the rocks on the exterior, which have likely experienced some change and reactions over time. So the material from the crater could provide an even better snapshot of the materials that were present when the Solar System first formed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kACHjV"&gt;Once the Hayabusa2 team felt confident they had grabbed enough from Ryugu, the spacecraft left the asteroid in November of 2019. After spending the last year traveling to Earth, the spacecraft deployed a small capsule late Friday night, with the samples of Ryugu located inside. The capsule then set on a course for Earth, plunging through our planet’s atmosphere this morning. It then deployed a parachute, slowing the vehicle from about 12 kilometers per second, or nearly 27,000 miles per hour, so that it could land gently in the  Woomera Prohibited Area in southern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tcyqtq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;teams from JAXA will go on an extended search in Australia to find the capsule&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4OOjV"&gt;After it hit the ground teams from JAXA went on &lt;a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201204_ts4/"&gt;an extended search in Australia to find the capsule&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle came down in an area that covers 100 square kilometers, or around 38 square miles. It also landed at nighttime in Australia, making the capsule even more difficult to spot. Fortunately, the capsule was equipped with a radio beacon that &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.slack.com/archives/DRQA3DNBT/p1607200317008800"&gt;helped teams locate&lt;/a&gt; where the spacecraft touched down. Before the landing, JAXA teams set up five antennas around the expected landing site to help find the signal, and the agency also had a helicopter with its own beacon receiver to help narrow down the search. A drone was also on hand to fly overhead of the area to take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANg7pR"&gt;Hayabusa2 is Japan’s second mission to retrieve samples of an asteroid. Its first mission, Hayabusa, returned asteroid samples to Earth in 2010, though the mission only managed to collect tiny grains of asteroid material. Hayabusa2 will hopefully have collected even more than the original Hayabusa’s offerings. And in 2023, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to return the largest sample of material from an asteroid ever collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t05Sh4"&gt;Though Hayabusa2 has completed its primary mission, the spacecraft isn’t quite done yet. The main spacecraft is still in space and &lt;a href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20201116_extMission/"&gt;just set out on a quest to visit another asteroid&lt;/a&gt; called 1998 KY26. It’ll take Hayabusa2 11 years to reach its new target, with the goal of analyzing the space rock and learning even more about the asteroids that zoom around us in space.&lt;/p&gt;
