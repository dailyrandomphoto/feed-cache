    <title>The best free password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtW8Row74mvxUTT5LZi-PgYw8mY=/0x0:2598x1732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917890/Bitwarden_iphone_android_display_blue.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our top pick is free to use across a range of operating systems on mobile and desktop.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bitwarden&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGzOfL"&gt;Using a password manager is one of the best steps you can take to protect your security online. A good password manager makes it easy to generate unique, strong passwords, and it will then securely save them so they’re available wherever you need them, whether that’s on your phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Basically, they take 90 percent of the work out of being safe online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBbt6W"&gt;Hopefully, at this point everyone knows why it’s important to use a unique password for all of your accounts online. But the short version is that using one password everywhere means that if just one site you use gets hacked, an attacker potentially has the password that unlocks your entire online life. Breaches still matter if you use a password manager, but at that point it’s a case of resetting just one password rather than dozens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1thEs"&gt;Although different password managers have different selling points, most offer the same core set of features. They generate passwords which they securely store, and they’ll prompt you to save passwords when you use them on websites. They’ll also sync your passwords across devices and autofill them into websites and apps when required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh4HAn"&gt;There are many good password managers available that charge a monthly fee, but for this guide we’re going to be focusing on free services. All of them have paid subscription tiers, but for most, the free tier offers the essential core features of a password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aNnmV"&gt;Our pick for the best for most people is Bitwarden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPU7Ha"&gt;The best for most people: Bitwarden&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KhFYyJhDEWLpdkTDgL_Oe3yCjxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347722/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_9.23.56_AM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGjqe"&gt;Bitwarden has basically everything you could want out of a password manager. It’s available across iOS and Android; it has native desktop applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux; and it also integrates with every major browser including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75mSmW"&gt;Bitwarden’s security has also been audited by a &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/third-party-security-audit/"&gt;third-party security company&lt;/a&gt;, and although it uses the cloud to sync your passwords between devices, it says it &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/security-faqs/#q-why-should-i-trust-bitwarden-with-my-passwords"&gt;stores them in an encrypted form&lt;/a&gt; that only you can unlock. You also have the option of protecting your Bitwarden account with two-factor authentication to provide an extra layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSnLRV"&gt;Importing our passwords was easy, and Bitwarden has guides for many popular password managers &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/import-data/"&gt;in its support pages&lt;/a&gt;. It supports biometric security on iOS and Android, and all of its software is nicely designed and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3LVJt"&gt;Bitwarden does have paid tiers, but we think most people will be able to do without most of the features they offer. Paying gets you access to encrypted file attachments, more second-factor security options, and reports on the overall security of the passwords you have in use. But even on the free tier, you can perform checks to see if individual passwords have been leaked in a password breach. Paying also gets you access to a built-in one-time code generator for two-factor authentication, but it’s easy and arguably more secure to use a separate app for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="adLPe6"&gt;
&lt;div id="v1bSwP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10374175" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="b5bYvK"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W4CLAh"&gt;Runner-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NINYyc"&gt;As part of our research, we also tried a variety of other password managers. Of these, Zoho Vault is another feature-packed free option, but its interface isn’t as good as Bitwarden’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TV0j4n"&gt;Zoho Vault&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/te5Nptg-a0LIJ9LVkmym530PCqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307342/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JsCPLN"&gt;Zoho Vault’s iOS and Android apps are nice enough, but its browser extension is a little clunky and buries useful features like its password generator behind one too many sub menus. It’s also unclear if the software has gone through a third-party security audit; the company didn’t respond to our query in time for publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HDhzhT"&gt;
&lt;div id="lvNPQw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10374191" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Sh7FnA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZVmKXa"&gt;Also-rans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EHSM1e"&gt;There were two other free password managers we felt weren’t up to Bitwarden and Zoho Vault’s standards. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Ffeature%2Fpassword-manager&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Norton Password Manager&lt;/a&gt; has the advantage of coming from a well-known cybersecurity company. But we found the way it attempts to simplify its setup process actually makes things more confusing, and Norton’s support pages didn’t do a great job at helping us work out where we’d gone wrong. Norton didn’t respond to our email asking whether the software has gone through a third-party security audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBHbtd"&gt;We also gave &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LogMeOnce&lt;/a&gt; a try, but we weren’t reassured by the presence of ads in its smartphone app. It also asked for many more permissions than the other password managers we tried. The company says this is necessary to enable its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2Fmugshot%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mugshot feature&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to give you information about unauthorized attempts to access your account, which is an optional feature. The company says it regularly hires third-party security researchers to test its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fAyOSv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Until recently, LastPass would have been included as a free password manager, but it’s making some changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rtVzg"&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; would have been included as a free password manager, but it’s making some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;changes to its free tier&lt;/a&gt; on March 16th that mean it will be much less usable as a free password manager. After that date, free users will be able to view and manage passwords on just a single category of devices: mobile or computer. “Mobile” subscribers will have access to phones, tablets, and smartwatches, while “Computer” subscribers will be able to use the service across PCs, Macs, and browser extensions. Given how most people switch between these two classes of devices on a daily basis, we think this will severely limit how useful LastPass’ free tier will be for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWv32v"&gt;Our focus on simplicity also means we’ve excluded &lt;a href="https://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;, a password manager that relies on third-party apps on non-Windows platforms. In addition, if you want to sync your passwords between devices, you have to use a third-party storage service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zzjfrc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="G2WMgx"&gt;Beyond the free options, there’s a huge array of paid password managers out there. Some of these have free tiers, but they’re so restrictive that they’re effectively not usable as a day-to-day password manager. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://1password.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most well-known paid option, but others include &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordPass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.remembear.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RememBear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keepsolid.com%2Fpasswarden%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Passwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboform.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboForm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.enpass.io/"&gt;Enpass&lt;/a&gt;, all of which limit their free versions in ways that we think make them unsuitable for long-term use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4z8pE"&gt;Finally, most modern internet browsers offer built-in password management features, but we think it’s worth taking the time to store your passwords in a standalone service. It gives you more flexibility to switch platforms and browsers in the future, and password managers also generally have interfaces that are better suited to the task of storing passwords. To make things simpler for yourself, you might want to turn off the built-in password manager in your browser once you’ve picked a standalone version to use, so you don’t run the risk of having passwords stored in two places at once.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is popular at vaccination sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYDo2M9w5mF98CH3mK221IW8bmI=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917888/1231516410.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLP8LB"&gt;The messaging that all three authorized vaccines are good options appears to be sinking in around the country. When the first batch of single-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines arrived in States this week, people were excited to take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBqtcI"&gt;In Connecticut, Hartford HealthCare let people decide which type of vaccine to sign up for, and the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1367146604231294980"&gt;more popular&lt;/a&gt; than expected. People were also given the choice at a Miami vaccination site. One recipient &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/us/miami-vaccines-pfizer-johnson-and-johnson/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that she picked Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson because it’s one dose; she’s afraid of needles and only wanted to do it once. A Minnesota couple &lt;a href="https://kttc.com/2021/03/04/rochester-residents-begin-receiving-the-one-and-done-johnson-johnson-vaccine/"&gt;told KTTC-TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that they were eager to get a vaccine that was only one dose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37aI0V"&gt;That’s a big relief for experts who worried that the shot faced a communications problem. Even though the vaccine was just as good as the other two authorized vaccines at keeping people out of the hospital and alive, overall, its ability to prevent disease wasn’t quite as strong during the trials testing it. They thought there might be the (mostly unfounded) perception that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine wasn’t a good option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnwtrI"&gt;“We have a vaccine now that has good efficacy that everyone is going to compare to the existing vaccines, and say it doesn’t look quite as good,” said Eric Rubin, a professor of immunology, during a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee last week. Experts stressed that people should take whichever vaccine they’re offered first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5mRqO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Re: J&amp;amp;J 72% vs Pfizer/Moderna 95% – it's sorta like comparing scores of golfers who teed off during a calm morning to those who teed off at 1pm when winds were howling. While it's hard to make precise adjustment, it's clear that equally good play will result in different scores.&lt;/p&gt;— Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1367828152936898561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O59pcU"&gt;But despite those early concerns, people around the country seem eager to line up for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. In addition to only requiring one dose — so people don’t have to take the time for two appointments — it can have &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/26/j-j-covid-vaccine-fda-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna/6806367002/"&gt;fewer side effects&lt;/a&gt; than the gene-based Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udPshg"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-00409-0%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100084481%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22315138%2Fcovid-vaccine-single-shot-johnson-distribution" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to directly compare&lt;/a&gt; the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to the other vaccines. They were tested at different times and in different locations. The gene-based vaccines were tested before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; that could make vaccines less effective were widespread. But all three vaccines are similar in one important way: they’re overwhelmingly effective at keeping people from developing severe cases of COVID-19 and out of the hospital. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22307585/covid-19-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-efficacy"&gt;all more effective than the flu shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yotU9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s looking like the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is very popular. Accounted for 984 doses, versus 1,166 for Pfizer. (FEMA had said they only had 500 J&amp;amp;J each day, but spox said had some leftover from Wed and got more)&lt;/p&gt;— Doug Hanks (@doug_hanks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doug_hanks/status/1367650936940822537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4861Us"&gt;The single-dose formulation is also more convenient. “It’s a hassle having to take time off work,” Salome Ruperty told &lt;a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/03/05/bronx-residents-line-up-to-be-the-first-to-receive-johnson---johnson-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Spectrum News NY1&lt;/a&gt; while lined up at a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine site in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2enu7Z"&gt;Some people may still turn down the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and seek out either the Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech shots. But the early reports make it seem less likely that the doses will go unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbcqo7"&gt;Just under &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/01/972538146/johnson-johnson-vaccine-rollout-begins-in-u-s-as-covid-19-cases-tick-up"&gt;4 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine were distributed to States this week. The company says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of March and 100 million by June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6v1Hxy"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been out for over three months now. Since then, it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;one of the most difficult gadgets to purchase&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for another shot to get this console, Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; models up for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9Vave"&gt;If you are looking for an Xbox Series X / S instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315452/xbox-series-x-s-restock-best-buy-price-pass-controller"&gt;Best Buy has also restocked Microsoft’s next-gen consoles today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you obtain your PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games or the PS5 version of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-PlayStation-5/dp/B08VJNMWR8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available on Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Uls0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2iyW"&gt;If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; might also be a good item to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;One thing I also recommend buying is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners, that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that were released originally on PS4, including &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted IV: A Thief’s End. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll53Kj"&gt;There’s no way to expand the SSD storage in your PS5 yet, but Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. But, if you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VMTNDMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Tesla launches a social platform and is closing its forums</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6HMpHyLx4LJheAYNDGxxPwdG3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917667/tesla_cybertruck_056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="keYLew"&gt;Tesla has launched a new social platform of sorts on its website geared at letting owners and fans of the brand “[t]ake actions on behalf of Tesla and the movement for cleaner energy.” The new microsite — called the “Tesla Engagement Platform” — already features information about how Nebraska residents can help support the company’s push to allow direct sales and service in the state, upcoming owner events, and fundraising for disaster relief in Texas following the recent winter storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFo4RO"&gt;“Engage Tesla is a new platform for both Tesla’s public policy team and Tesla Owner’s Clubs,” the first &lt;a href="https://engage.tesla.com/articles/14-welcome-tesla-engagement-platform"&gt;post on the new microsite reads&lt;/a&gt;. “Its goal is to create a digital home base for all of our work, and make it easier for Tesla community members to learn what’s top of mind for us, take meaningful action, and stay in the loop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6ZUso"&gt;At the same time, Tesla is also closing the long-standing forums section of its website. While there are many Tesla-related forums on the internet now, Tesla’s own message board was one of the first places where owners and interested buyers could gather and discuss the good and bad things about the company’s products. It was also unmoderated, which led to constant problems with spam and trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEQ1g0"&gt;Tesla’s message boards still served that purpose to this day, but a notice at the top appeared this week telling users that the forums will become read-only starting March 15th. “To continue the conversation with the Tesla community,” the notice reads, “visit engage.tesla.com.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CVakSA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s forums were a place to kvetch, but they often got bogged down by bots and trolls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Gwhk"&gt;The Tesla Engagement Platform appears to be an effort to further harness the potent enthusiasm of the company’s supporters by centralizing some of the work they were already doing on their own. For instance, the Silicon Valley-based Tesla Owners club &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/20/tesla-owners-rallying-to-provide-aid-to-austin/"&gt;had already raised $10,000 to support the Del Valle, Texas community&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds the area in which the company’s new factory is being built. And Tesla owners have long lobbied their governments to adopt green energy policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WS2K1a"&gt;But there’s never been as direct a feedback loop with the company’s policy team as is being promised with the new microsite. The new site also makes it easy for people to apply for membership to local owners’ clubs and see upcoming events. It also tracks with Tesla’s recent efforts to bring die-hard supporters even deeper into the fold, like when the company started taking questions from retail shareholders on its earnings calls.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8bIRb"&gt;Being an “engagement platform,” there is also a commenting system, which a number of users have already employed to share their ideas for improvements. Some want a better direct line to the company’s oft-criticized customer service department. But one of the most common suggestions so far is to &lt;a href="https://engage.tesla.com/comments/396"&gt;keep the old forums around&lt;/a&gt;, or at least replace the message board with something similar — but moderated — on the new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vVWEy"&gt;“Please do not get rid of the Forums. This is not a replacement. The forums (with exception of the trolls on it) brought about informed discussion to help fellow owners with issues,” one user wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdfeXy"&gt;Meanwhile, over on the official (and now officially doomed) Tesla forums, users are sharing their thoughts about the sudden decision &lt;a href="https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/183426/end-of-tesla-forums"&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5rZj2"&gt;“Welcome to the end of the line. You have exactly 13 more days to post threads and comments,” the initial post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1JXuo"&gt;“This engagement site looks very limited, can’t envision it being an adequate replacement,” one user wrote. “Where are y’all going to visit? Feels like a couple of years ago when my golf club shuttered up. Scrambling to find a new home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kG1mi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ex-5CndmZqOiQxMH1SbbYK2sEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67448810/vpavic_4275_20201030_0050.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 2021 11:37AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has restocks available for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051808434335616" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; consoles. You can find additional information on both here. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months. Available at the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-all-access%23findaretailer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fxbox-one%2Fxbox-all-access%2Fpcmcat1579299055180.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1579299055180&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fxbox-all-access%2F8571041&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-all-access%2F-%2FN-he40f&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon, I feel seen </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Raya, voiced by Kelly Marie Tran, seeks the help of the legendary dragon Sisu, voiced by Awkwafina. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3QgIOEyEZpBvJoiecxQryYu4awo=/357x0:1563x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917610/raya_online_use_217_abfccdd8__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Raya, voiced by Kelly Marie Tran, seeks the help of the legendary dragon Sisu, voiced by Awkwafina.  | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmNbzK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeRayaLastDragon030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is so much more than just the latest Disney flick, at least for me. Admittedly, I’m not even a huge Disney fan. But somehow because of &lt;em&gt;Raya&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a little girl in me who finally feels seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kkdu1"&gt;Growing up in America, I hardly ever saw Asians in movies or television. And if I did, they were rarely brown and Southeast Asian like me. Finally, that’s changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PaVwNc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Growing up in America, I hardly ever saw Asians in movies or television&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rr39pM"&gt;Raya is voiced by Kelly Marie Tran, who is Vietnamese American. The film is inspired by diverse Southeast Asian cultures. The screenplay was written by Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim, who both trace their roots back to Southeast Asia. That’s one reason why there are so many cool cultural easter Eggs to find in the film. &lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/raya-and-the-last-dragon-finds-magic-in-southeast-asian-tradition/"&gt;Raya’s name&lt;/a&gt; means “celebration” in Malay. She gets around by riding atop her animal sidekick named “Tuk Tuk,” who shares its name with Cambodia’s iconic &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/2097978/what-will-become-cambodias-endangered-tuk-tuk-drivers"&gt;motorbike-powered carriages&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll find similar sets of wheels across much of Southeast Asia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTEkGA"&gt;In a teaser that almost made me cry (and I’m not a cryer), Raya wields what look like bamboo &lt;a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/10/21/20/is-that-arnis-disneys-raya-teaser-has-filipino-fans-gushing"&gt;Arnis sticks&lt;/a&gt; — weapons used in Filipino martial arts. Her &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/how-raya-last-dragon-built-southeast-asian-fantasy-world-n1259465"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is reminiscent of the Indonesian kris. The epic combat scenes in the film also draw from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2021/3/2/22309833/raya-and-the-last-dragon-dragon-design-disney"&gt;fighting styles&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2021/3/2/22309833/raya-and-the-last-dragon-dragon-design-disney"&gt;Thailand, Malaysia,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.asianjournal.com/entertainment/showbiz/raya-and-the-last-dragon-finds-inspiration-in-the-cultures-people-of-southeast-asia/"&gt;Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tuk Tuk and Raya" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aL_XBQHJHv5FCm9BDJ3QkLl6wEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347856/a7a4cf9275d430e60b5bc946b0e9b551_4096x1715_d23efbaa.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuk Tuk and Raya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FUnOok"&gt;If a lot of that is unfamiliar to you, I don’t blame you. I was born in the Philippines and I didn’t even learn about Arnis until I was in college in the US. When you don’t see yourself reflected in the world around you, you lose out on a lot. That’s why it means so much to see Raya, brown and badass, wielding the same weapons that my ancestors did to fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SlwSQ"&gt;As a whole, Asian Americans are already underrepresented in media — but Southeast Asians are often even more overlooked. “Asian American” is an enormous umbrella that encompasses many peoples, cultures, and languages. Lumping everyone into one group can obscure that diversity. Even worse, it can make some communities and the inequities they face invisible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fl2Vfo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Southeast Asians are often even more overlooked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VgtPhc"&gt;That’s a problem that’s often talked about as a lack of “&lt;a href="http://aapidata.com/blog/countmein-unemployment-poverty/"&gt;disaggregated data&lt;/a&gt;” for the Asian American and Pacific Islander umbrella group. There often isn’t enough data collected that breaks down how experiences vary from group to group. For instance, many Southeast Asians came to the US as refugees after the Vietnam War or the Cambodian genocide by the Khmer Rouge — and that can make their migration stories, and the resources they have access to in America, very different than others who immigrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pw5Q0y"&gt;Poverty among Hmong Americans, many of whom &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/29/history-hmong-americans-explains-why-they-might-decide-election/"&gt;came to the US as refugees&lt;/a&gt; after cooperating with the US during its “Secret War” in Laos, is twice as high — &lt;a href="https://www.searac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SEARAC_NationalSnapshot_PrinterFriendly.pdf"&gt;26 percent&lt;/a&gt; — as it is among the Asian American community as a whole. That kind of data is necessary to dispel the Asian model minority myth, a stereotype that harms all Asian Americans because it wrongly assumes that our communities already have access to all the resources we need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzhoL4"&gt;If you’ve seen &lt;em&gt;Raya&lt;/em&gt; or even just its trailers, then you know that the movie is about how to bring communities together. Disaggregating data isn’t about dividing anyone. To bring folks together, you have to first &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a9Ez0r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;data is necessary to dispel the Asian model minority myth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hYs1f"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeRayaLastDragon030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we see its characters face adversity that fits into Southeast Asia’s modern history: there’s war, loss, hunger, and a long search for healing. The leading characters form a sort of blended family of refugees who are building a new world together after each of them have lost nearly everything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NT1x69"&gt;I’m not saying the movie and its depictions are perfect. It’s a Disney-fied version of real life, after all. The movie still &lt;a href="https://jumpcutonline.co.uk/2021/03/01/review-raya-and-the-last-dragon-2021/"&gt;blends&lt;/a&gt; all the different cultures of Southeast Asia into a single fantasy world, and Disney’s been criticized in the past for creating a monolithic culture in movies like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/critics-accuse-disney-culture-theft-ahead-moana-release-n685866"&gt;Moana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/disney-mulan-review/"&gt;Mulan&lt;/a&gt; that again “aggregate” aspects from different peoples. &lt;em&gt;Raya&lt;/em&gt; will probably face a whole lot of scrutiny, in part because of the pressure to fairly represent a huge group of people whose stories largely haven’t been told in mainstream media before. I’m already feeling the pressure from writing this post, knowing that there are things I’ll fail to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy6gyO"&gt;But in this case, I’ll take an argument about how a story should be told over no story at all. Hopefully, it opens up room for more stories to surface. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X and S are available at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9qswNyuNzz-gXQIP_TtJloSeq_g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917600/vpavic_4275_20201030_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7PQdwZ"&gt;Best Buy has randomly restocked supplies for both of Microsoft’s recently released next-gen consoles: the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051808434335616" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt;. Like some other gaming gadgets released late last year, these consoles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt; to buy, but if you move quickly, you can grab one right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXr832"&gt;If you are looking for a PS5 instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22311269/playstation-5-ps5-restock-digital-edition-console-best-buy"&gt;Best Buy has stock available for both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9cSMZS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llSpqU"&gt;If you are new to the Xbox console family, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.costco.com%2Fxbox-series-s-with-additional-controller.product.100699182.html"&gt;Costco is also selling a Series S console bundle&lt;/a&gt; with an extra controller for $340.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCIQXi"&gt;If you secure either console and wonder what to buy next, you might want to think about what games to add to your library. But if you’re unsure what to get, I suggest buying a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for console or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-3-Month-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Microsoft-Digital-Download%2F309259942%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. I strongly suggest Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as it includes additional perks, most notably a membership for Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BXin5w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w6T2Lp"&gt;I also advise you to buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extra controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. When it comes to additional storage, both consoles are rather limited: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the Series X. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D1Dj1"&gt;If you plan to download some older games, but want to save your limited SSD, you can grab &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G7PrYx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZjEy29"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WLrsYu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Timnit Gebru was fired from Google — then the harassers arrived</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u3pXJDT03lHFWLnASDkzqq2qhQo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917582/VRG_ILLO_4413_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Even three months after Gebru’s controversial termination from the AI Ethics team, the sustained campaign of aggressive tweets and emails keeps coming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Ee9qYa"&gt;Timnit Gebru had expected her colleagues to rally around her when she was abruptly fired from Google on December 2nd. She was a well-respected AI ethics researcher, her termination as controversial as it was sudden. What she hadn’t anticipated was becoming a catalyst for labor activism in Silicon Valley — or the subject of a harassment campaign that surfaced alongside her supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jucFrP"&gt;Her firing came weeks after Google managers asked her to retract a paper on the dangers of large language models, like the ones that power the company’s search engine. Gebru pushed back, saying the company needed to be more transparent about the publication process. Employees saw the termination as a blatant act of retaliation, and thousands of workers, researchers, and academics &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; demanding an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNTsQI"&gt;In early December, as media attention mounted and tech workers across the country came to her defense, Gebru waited to see how Google would respond. &lt;em&gt;What is this company capable of?&lt;/em&gt; she asked herself. She didn’t have to wait long to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6nugoT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter enabled Gebru’s colleagues to stand up for her; it also made her vulnerable to a small but very active group of harassers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJdqpN"&gt;On December 4th, Jeff Dean, Google’s head of AI, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;published his views on Gebru’s dismissal&lt;/a&gt;. He said she had resigned — a fact she openly disputed — and that her paper hadn’t met the bar for publication. His words lay the groundwork for a very different type of campaign, one which used the groundswell of support surrounding Gebru’s firing as a stand-in for the ills of cancel culture. Twitter enabled Gebru’s colleagues to stand up for her; it also made her vulnerable to a small but very active group of harassers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q2qt7G"&gt;Over the next two months, Pedro Domingos, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington, and Michael Lissack, a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB905899646822388500"&gt;Wall Street whistleblower turned admitted harasser&lt;/a&gt;, promoted the narrative that Gebru’s work was “advocacy disguised as science.” They said she’d &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos/status/1337519351205806080?lang=en"&gt;created a toxic environment at Google&lt;/a&gt; and was “obsessed with being a victim.” They wrote off her supporters as sycophants and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos/status/1337523808878542850"&gt;“deranged activists.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHTyOv"&gt;On Twitter, the campaign gained momentum with the help of anonymous accounts. Gebru suspected they were sock puppets, fake profiles created for the sole purpose of harassment, since many had popped up around her firing. Some claimed to work in tech, using phrases like “pro-DEI minority,” “She/them,” and “LBGTQ Latinx” in their bios. When Emily M. Bender, a computational linguistics professor at the University of Washington and Gebru’s co-author on the paper, reported one of these accounts for harassment, Domingos implied she was being prejudiced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="x2tZRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He enables these people, and gets to distance himself because he’s not the one saying ‘go back to Africa’” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZJss0"&gt;To Gebru, the harassment wouldn’t be possible without Jeff Dean, who stayed quiet about the campaign for months, despite being tagged in numerous posts. “He enables these people, and gets to distance himself because he’s not the one saying ‘go back to Africa,’” she says. “Pedro [Domingos] is smart enough not to say these types of things, too. They hide behind civility and enable the trolls. That’s how they get away with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4BELT"&gt;Neither Domingos nor Lissack had an obvious connection to Gebru’s work prior to December 2020. But Domingos had a history of battling those he saw as “militant liberals” — particularly in academia, where he believed free speech needed to be protected. Lissack’s connection, on the other hand, was more random. He became fixated on proving that Gebru’s work wasn’t science, though he himself is not an AI expert. The men met over email and collaborated through social media. Where they intersected was the belief that Gebru was trying to cancel them and that they were, improbably, the real victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsleSL"&gt;When Domingos first saw the news about Gebru’s firing, he didn’t think to intervene. He was dealing with another battle: the world’s largest machine learning conference was requiring presenters to submit a statement on the impact — good and bad — that their research could have on society, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-020-03611-8&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22309962%2Ftimnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s alarming that NeurIPS papers are being rejected based on ‘ethics reviews,’” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos/status/1336187141366317056"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “How do we guard against ideological biases in such reviews? Since when are scientific conferences in the business of policing the perceived ethics of technical papers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;It was part of an ongoing fight in the academic community. In 2018, conference attendees, led in part by machine learning expert Anima Anandkumar, pushed to change the acronym of the event, “NIPS,” because it was “prone to unwelcome puns.” Anandkumar cited an unofficial pre-conference gathering called TITS and T-shirts that read “my NIPS are NP-hard.” The debate resurfaced in 2020 when Domingos said “the name change was a terrible idea” that Anandkumar had bullied the conference board into accepting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ14S8"&gt;Domingos had been interested in similar issues at the University of Washington. In June 2018, Stuart Reges, a faculty member at the school, wrote an article in &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt;, the “voice of the intellectual dark web” titled “Why Women Don’t Code.” In it, he expressed support for James Damore, a Google engineer who was fired after circulating a memo that argued biological differences between men and women might explain the gender gap in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JRMHQz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Perhaps there aren’t more women in CS because they’re not interested, and we shouldn’t force them to be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CYrLRs"&gt;Reges’ article upset some students, and the computer science department sent out an email saying it disagreed with his claims. Domingos responded to the graduate student mailing list, writing that, “One of Stuart’s (and Damore’s) main points is that perhaps there aren’t more women in CS because they’re not interested, and we shouldn’t force them to be. We can press on regardless, but whether that’s best for either women or men is a question that surely deserves consideration.” He added: “When a woman is hired or admitted over a more qualified man, the man was discriminated against. Referring to general notions of oppression, benefits, etc. doesn’t make it legal or ethical.” One student responded that this type of comment was helping to create a “hostile and unwelcoming environment” in computer science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXQumO"&gt;In December 2020, when Domingos tweeted about the NeurIPS ethics review, Anima Anandkumar jumped in, saying the community needed to get rid of extremists like him in order to be able to thrive. She then published a “block list,” which included people who’d liked his posts to “establish accountability on social media.” The list prompted a backlash from people who felt they’d been unfairly included. Domingos said he was reaching out to her employer to try to curtail her “disgraceful behavior.” Anandkumar deleted the list, &lt;a href="https://anima-ai.org/2020/12/16/my-heartfelt-apology/"&gt;published an apology on her blog&lt;/a&gt;, and shut down her Twitter account. (Anandkumar did not respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxiaQD"&gt;To Domingos, the scuffle indicated why it was important to fight even small battles against what he classified as the “woke mob.” He’d grown up in Portugal, a country that transitioned from a dictatorship to democracy in the 1970s. “Each one of these things sounds very innocent, but then it sets up the stage for the next step,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Once I get to declare what speech is harmful and what isn’t, I can install my tyranny because I can decide what you say and not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UM6FRV"&gt;In the midst of the spat with Anandkumar, Domingos began tweeting about Gebru, echoing Jeff Dean’s claim that the researcher hadn’t been fired. “Timnit’s paper was not censored...and she was not fired,” he wrote on December 11th. “Rather, if you trash your company’s efforts in your area and threaten to resign, you shouldn’t be surprised if they let you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2uv1ca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lissack later pleaded guilty to harassing executives at the firm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P3gnDI"&gt;His view was shared by an unlikely ally: a whistleblower named Michael Lissack who’d worked at Smith Barney in the ‘90s and exposed “widespread fraud in the municipal bond market,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/21/business/international-business-a-wall-street-whistle-blower-settles-his-own-fraud-charge.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The move made Lissack somewhat of a folk hero in the financial services industry. Lissack later pleaded guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB905899646822388500"&gt;harassing executives at the firm&lt;/a&gt;, sending prank emails and soliciting phone calls that tied up the institution’s main phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mVolt"&gt;After Smith Barney, Lissack continued to fight against issues he found “morally offensive” — though his definition of this seemed to evolve. In 2017, he &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2017/05/10/phaedra-parks-should-lose-law-license-michael-lissack/"&gt;filed an official grievance against Phaedra Parks&lt;/a&gt;, an entertainment lawyer and &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives of Atlanta&lt;/em&gt; star, to try to get her disbarred. He also claims to have exposed Vicki Gunvalson, of the &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives of Orange County&lt;/em&gt;, for running a fake cancer charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzxX8z"&gt;On his resume, Lissack said he’d been a visiting research professor at George Washington University. When&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to the school to confirm, a media relations specialist said he’d checked with multiple groups but could not verify Lissack’s employment. Lissack forwarded an email from a professor at the school, who said he’d been a “guest lecturer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZ2k3v"&gt;In December 2020, Lissack read a copy of Gebru’s paper that had leaked on Reddit. He sent Domingos an email with his assessment, though the two did not know each other personally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YnQb9o"&gt;I read the draft ... not academically sound&lt;br&gt;Lack of declaration of standards of evaluation.&lt;br&gt;Lack of declaration that this is really an abductive OPINION piece.&lt;br&gt;Lack of adequate discussion of trade-offs.&lt;br&gt;No disclosure of competing hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ITQT0u"&gt;Then he decided to publish an article laying out his views. He said Gebru’s paper was, at best, sloppy science, and failed to acknowledge that it was a “position paper / advocacy piece rather than research.” He even created a Twitter account to promote his work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="U7RIDe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"I am not after airtime" &lt;a href="https://t.co/DCfzQVaW9v"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DCfzQVaW9v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Bauman (@_mbauman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_mbauman/status/1350198429872496640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="supzct"&gt;Domingos quickly stepped in to help. “The paper by @timnitGebru et al that led to her resignation is advocacy disguised as research, says philosopher of science @LissackMichael in this devastating critique,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos/status/1349817407364239360"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53EJkT"&gt;Over the next two weeks, a familiar pattern emerged. Gebru would tweet something related to her firing, or Google, or AI ethics research, and Lissack would jump in with a response, often tagging Domingos. On January 27th, Gebru wrote that some of her critics were making up arguments that weren’t in her original paper. “How would you know since you will in general only politely interact with the sycophants,” Lissack responded. “Everyone else you call names and mistreat and then falsely claim you are a victim…@pmddomingos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDW2LN"&gt;The next day, Gebru tweeted about April Christina Curley, a diversity recruiter who was fired from Google in September, and alluded to her own termination. “You were ‘resignated’ for insubordination attempted sedition and attempted extortion,” Lissack wrote. “You DID NOT do your job.” He also said that Gebru “does not belong working anywhere as a corporate employee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iTk6x"&gt;This opinion was echoed by anonymous Twitter accounts that claimed to belong to Google employees. One, which used the name Jeff Jeffries, said they worked at Google Brain and used a photo of a Black man in their avatar photo. Another, Bili Franklin, said they were a product manager at Google, used they / them pronouns, and identified as Latinx. (A Google spokesperson confirmed that neither of these people works at Google.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEYH8o"&gt;On December 31st, “Bili Franklin” tweeted screenshots of an anonymous employee forum called Blind, where a Google worker had written that Gebru had “rancid egomaniacal outbursts” and was unstable. (Blind assumes someone is a Google employee if they have a Google email address.) Domingos retweeted the screenshots. “For anyone who was wondering, this is what people inside Google think of @timnitGebru’s antics,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfZasl"&gt;Bender reported the tweet for harassment, prompting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos/status/1354171490552320000"&gt;Domingos to respond&lt;/a&gt;: “Wow. Emily Bender, a supposedly respectable academic and defender of minorities, is calling @BiliFranklinBLM, a Latinx LGBTQ PM at Google, a sock puppet just because she dares to criticize @timnitGebru.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77HN1e"&gt;More anonymous Twitter and email accounts popped up. Some called Gebru a bitch and told her to “go back to Africa.” Others said she was arrogant and only hired because she is Black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TeXXh5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He wanted to catch me”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="reSEJu"&gt;When Gebru pushed back at the men on Twitter, it only seemed to inflame them further. Once, she cracked and told Domingos to go fuck himself. “This is how an AI ethicist speaks to a fellow computer scientist,” he responded. Gebru felt like she’d fallen into his trap, though she didn’t regret what she’d said. “That’s what he wanted,” she adds. “He wanted to catch me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llkVuG"&gt;In fact, Domingos had laid out his tactics for combating “social-justice radicals” in an article in &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt;. “Goad [the cancel crowd] into overreaching,” he said. “Mock them mercilessly.” He added that “cancelers take themselves extremely seriously, imagining themselves to be social-justice angels whose holy ends justify every imaginable means. Their sanctimonious spirit is a gift to you, if you call it out instead of playing along with its conceit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mx0EJj"&gt;In January, a PhD student at the University of Washington tweeted parts of the article on Twitter. Lissack then posted her diversity statement where she spoke about her struggles with mental illness. “[The student] acknowledges her mental illness here,” he wrote. “Much better to disengage Even better would be for her to get help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW8vAs"&gt;Lissack later told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the tweet was “an error,” though he did not stop going after Gebru’s supporters. In February, he emailed the University of Washington to report “research misconduct” by Emily M. Bender and wrote an open letter to Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, who was fired after using an automated script to look through her emails for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. He also wrote Alex Hanna, a research scientist on Gebru and Mitchell’s team, an email saying she was “next” and told her colleague, Emily Denton, that their tweets had “crossed a line.” When Mitchell tweeted that she’d lost her health insurance, he emailed her former co-workers to suggest she sign up for Obamacare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DM0Yg5"&gt;Lissack also contacted a woman who’d been collecting screenshots of his activity on Twitter. “Karma is not a nice lady,” he wrote. “You have been warned. She is very patient and highly effective.” Lissack emailed the woman’s husband to say that his patience had ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF4TbR"&gt;When asked about the threatening notes, Lissack said the woman had “organized the campaign to have me banned on Twitter. It had to stop.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P00K8"&gt;On February 1st, Lissack was suspended from Twitter. He’d tweeted roughly 2,000 times in the 17 days he had his account, mostly about the controversy surrounding Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3gci5"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Lissack says he wasn’t sorry to leave the platform. “There is this horrible pull that people have on Twitter,” he explains. “Why bother getting into nuance? The net result is that people get sucked into directions they might not actually wish to go. I’m guilty. It happened. I’ll learn from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nXjs19"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Karma is not a nice lady”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhlBOo"&gt;When asked why he’d gone after a &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/em&gt; star in 2017, Lissack responded, “You haven’t talked to many whistleblowers. I see something that to me is morally offensive. People may not agree with the things that strike me as wrong but I am who I am, what can I tell you. To me, the media representing [Gebru’s paper] as good science is offensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5sjkP"&gt;On March 1st, Jeff Dean finally spoke out about Lissack’s behavior. “I (and Google) have no connection to Michael Lissack,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1366529935473434625"&gt;he wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “I have seen enough disturbing reports of this sort of behavior that I have emailed him and asked him to cease contacting people who don’t want to be contacted. This kind of behavior has no place in scientific discourse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytWrfN"&gt;Lissack’s theory about Gebru has evolved since &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; started reporting this story. He now compares her to Aaron Swartz, a programmer and activist who died by suicide in 2013. He says Bender, a renowned researcher, has been pushing Gebru to “not let go” for her own gain. “The ONLY person benefiting here is Emily,” Lissack wrote in a text message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Emily is becoming influential when before this she was a no body.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlSU5a"&gt;On February 9th, Twitter unsuspended Lissack’s account. Domingos welcomed him back, writing, “Glad to have @LissackMichael back after the cancel crowd’s failed attempt to expel him from Twitter.” Lissack made his account private, and changed his bio to say “UNCANCELLED!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cCrOa"&gt;“I live in Salem, Massachusetts,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “What occurred on Twitter was no different than a version of the witch trials.” It’s perhaps telling that Lissack sees himself in the role of unjustly persecuted woman, rather than misogynistic male judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUgoVW"&gt;Lissack later deleted his account, saying the “17 day adventure” was “official over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p0aSAP"&gt;To Gebru, the strategy was laughably transparent. “The funniest part to me is the cancel culture stuff,” she says. “Who is fired? It’s me. But now they’re complaining about cancel culture. I didn’t even know about Pedro Domingos or his work before he started tagging me on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hogwarts Legacy developer leaves after controversy over reactionary YouTube videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hogwarts Legacy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nes68m_D3f7iGxmDJ0kWbeJyRFs=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917426/EnIVQHKUYAEGfed.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tlRerg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; developer Troy Leavitt has left the project following criticism of videos that &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-lead-designer-used-to-run-anti-social-j-1846316222"&gt;defended the reactionary Gamergate harassment movement&lt;/a&gt; and dismissed sexual misconduct complaints against media executives. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Troylus_true/status/1367646558209052674"&gt;Leavitt tweeted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Troylus_true/status/1367656637662715909"&gt;the news&lt;/a&gt; last night, saying he had resigned from studio Avalanche Software despite feeling “absolutely secure in my position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwKkuy"&gt;Leavitt was the lead designer on &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440330/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-ps5-playstation-5-trailer-open-world-sony"&gt;open-world roleplaying game&lt;/a&gt; set in the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; universe. Last month, &lt;em&gt;Did You Know Gaming?&lt;/em&gt; contributor Liam Robertson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1362919930698596360"&gt;highlighted a YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; where Leavitt posted videos between 2016 and 2018. The videos attacked social justice activism and defended figures like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/31/16955152/nolan-bushnell-gdc-pioneer-award-notnolan-metoo"&gt;Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/8/17443370/pixar-walt-disney-animation-john-lasseter-leaving-company-sexual-harassment"&gt;Pixar co-founder John Lasseter&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom have been accused of sexual harassment. In the Bushnell video, Leavitt indicated that Avalanche and its parent company Warner Bros. were aware of his YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ya7exF"&gt;Leavitt said on Twitter that he had “made the decision to part ways with Avalanche Software” and would be releasing a video about the decision soon. “To clarify: I felt absolutely secure in my position. However, I still wanted to resign for reasons that I will explain in that forthcoming video. I’m in excellent spirits and very pleased with my relationship with WB and Avalanche.” A representative for WB didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wm2hF7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;1. I have made the decision to part ways with Avalanche Software.  I have nothing but good things to say about the game, the dev team, and WB Games. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. I will be releasing a YouTube Video about this soon on my channel.&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Leavitt (@Troylus_true) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Troylus_true/status/1367646558209052674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZl6A5"&gt;Leavitt’s connection to Avalanche escalated an existing controversy over the game. &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; was announced soon after &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; author J.K. Rowling &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy"&gt;published comments&lt;/a&gt; calling “trans activism” a threat to women, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21449215/troubled-blood-review-jk-rowling-transphobia-controversy"&gt;a novel whose villain&lt;/a&gt; reflected anti-transgender tropes. The comments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443940/hogwarts-legacy-jk-rowling-transphobia-warner-bros-robert-galbraith"&gt;led WB to clarify&lt;/a&gt; that Rowling was not involved in the production of the game, although she would likely make money from it. Later rumors suggested that &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt; would &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/harry-potter-video-game-will-allow-for-transgender-characters"&gt;specifically allow transgender characters&lt;/a&gt; in a push for inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUghF8"&gt;The resurfaced Leavitt videos &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/24/22299095/harry-potter-jk-rowling-hogwarts-legacy-wb-games-troy-leavitt-youtube-resetera"&gt;pushed popular forum ResetEra&lt;/a&gt; to ban threads about &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt;. “This is a uniquely awful situation where both the creator of the IP and a senior producer on the game have unrepentant bigoted views,” wrote an administrator. “There will be no threads for trailers or official announcements, no hype threads, no fluff pieces about its features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHDhFN"&gt;It’s unclear what, if anything, Leavitt’s departure means for &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt;’s overall development. The game was initially set for release this year, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229085/hogwarts-legacy-delay-2022-release-date"&gt;later pushed&lt;/a&gt; to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision finale: where do we go from here? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-E1fE7UA1aw9Vr5TYCANAcRKR4=/265x0:1693x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917418/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_10.08.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VDiaCO"&gt;Eight weeks and nine episodes later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303068/wandavision-episode-8-explainer-recap-scarlet-witch-white-vision-post-credits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has come to an end. It may not have delivered the bang some fans were expecting, but there is still plenty of story that &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeWandaVisionFinale030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;sets up for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s fourth phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhMDAq"&gt;Before we get into that, the biggest question is whether &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;nailed the ending. Like too many third acts within the MCU, big, splashy CGI fights in lieu of more nuanced storytelling can sometimes get in the way of providing a satisfying, emotional closure for fans. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;never lost sight of the story it wanted to tell, the show it wanted to be, and the finale does a mostly decent job of hitting those final notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPyes8"&gt;Sure, there are some rushed sequences and scenes compacted into a couple of minutes that could have stretched out for 15 or 20. TV show finales are always tough to perfectly land — it’s why there are only a handful of series that have &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/08/whats-the-most-satisfying-tv-series-finale.html"&gt;achieved a nearly perfect scorecard&lt;/a&gt; by the time the credits roll on the last episode — but for a show about the power of a woman’s grief and unrelenting love, the team did one hell of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hQ3Ll"&gt;All right, so where does the finale leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyt8Xz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(I have to imagine if you’re reading a piece about a show’s final episode, you understand that spoilers are ahead. But just in case, here’s your warning that we’re getting into the nitty-gritty details ahead.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xn6ht2S77COsIw0tSJIPuE8km54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347840/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_10.11.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uTqM3M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering the basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VRQ8py"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s finale — literally called “The Series Finale” — wrapped up as much as possible within roughly 40 minutes excluding credits. Here’s a running list of some of the big takeaways: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0F9nAm"&gt;Pietro is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;actually Ralph&lt;/a&gt;, who seems to own the house Agatha was using. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nXeioa"&gt;White Vision, created by S.W.O.R.D. to seemingly destroy Wanda, quickly came and went. He encountered a short battle and conversation with Real Vision, where he was shown real memories and served unquestionable proof that White Vision was not the person he believed himself to be. Where he left to, well, that’s still unknown. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g3yywl"&gt;Finally, and most importantly, Agatha revealed that the mystical book of spells she kept encased in magic in her (or, I suppose, Ralph’s) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;basement is, in fact, the Darkhold&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is this a huge moment for &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D &lt;/em&gt;fans everywhere who may be wagging their finger at the canonical retcon (if Agatha has had the book in her hands since the 1600s, does that just erase several &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. &lt;/em&gt;storylines?), but it sets up Wanda’s next steps and how this all connects with &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HyJJ60"&gt;We still don’t know which hero Monica Rambeau is playing, but we do have a pretty good hint about her future. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bmVdbA"&gt;We know what Scarlet Witch’s new costume looks like, and it’s immaculate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="YycAki"&gt;A little underwhelming, right? The side characters brought in as the supporting cast to Wanda’s own television show were underserved by the story’s end. Darcy helps land Director Hayward in jail and then disappears, Jimmy wounds up in roughly the exact same position as where he started, and even the neighbors never really get their final due. (Although, we’ll see Darcy again in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20702385/marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-thor-4-love-and-thunder-natalie-portman-taiki-waititi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Jimmy in &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ant-Man_and_the_Wasp:_Quantumania"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Where the episode did shine, outside of nailing the final moments between Wanda and Vision, was giving Agatha and Wanda their chance to finally hash things out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvGm68"&gt;Since it’s the finale, and there aren’t too many surprises or theories to explain, let’s dig into the final post-credit scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA03v_ByTgLx_z1PuEcz4lFy5kQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347841/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_10.09.10_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gZJ7d6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monica Rambeau is going to space &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cktg3H"&gt;There are two credits for this week’s episode, and both are pretty damn exciting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2JR1S"&gt;The first features Monica Rambeau talking to a secret Skrull character, who informs Monica that she was sent by a “friend of her mom’s” because he wants to see her. When asked where the so-called friend is, the Skrull character simply points to space. She gets excited about heading out to a cool space base, and we get excited because we know that spells two things: Nick Fury and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20702391/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-x-men-mutants-fantastic-four-captain-marvel-2-black-panther"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpeCEg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761022/spider-man-far-from-home-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-mcu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fans might remember the last time we saw Nick Fury was aboard a spaceship full of Skrull workers in the film’s post-credits scene. It’s a massive base (likely a &lt;em&gt;S.W.O.R.D. &lt;/em&gt;base), and he’s seemingly in charge of operations. We already know that Monica Rambeau’s character is confirmed for &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;sets up some storylines I’m sure we’ll see play out. She’ll have to confront Carol, her pseudo-aunt who she suddenly doesn’t seem to like talking about, and explore her newfound powers while taking on a celestial villain of some kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxC75r"&gt;There’s also, however, &lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/secret-invasion-nick-fury-disney-series-may-be-biggest-marvel-event-of-all/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secret Invasion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige announced the Nick Fury-centric series back in December. The show takes place after &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a good chance that Monica Rambeau could show up in that series, too, especially since Ben Mendelsohn’s Talos (the Skrull character from the original &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;) is also set to reprise his role for the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHxK6x"&gt;Monica Rambeau’s story is only just getting started, and it’s clear she’s going to become a key figure in Marvel’s fourth phase. The question is still whether that’s as Spectrum, her most popular character in the comics. Okay, but what about that second post-credits scene? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYVmqFBeUID2J60jC6L8OEYdhwQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347842/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_10.09.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Oc6xEV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wanda, are you there? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cPaeLX"&gt;Look, if I’m being honest, if I had to watch my kids and synthezoid husband literally disappear after collapsing the fake town I made to deal with my grief, I too would run away to the outskirts of Canada or Norway or Iceland, living remotely in a tiny cabin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmw10b"&gt;A harmless way to grieve once more, some might suggest, but nothing is ever harmless or simple in the MCU. The first Wanda we see in the post-credits is drinking some tea on the porch, but it’s only when we venture into the house that we see the real Wanda levitating while encased in her own Chaos magic while reading the Darkhold — at least, I’m making the assumption that it’s the real Wanda. It could also be an astral projection, like the one we saw Doctor Strange use when he was first studying magic. The question is why does Wanda have two versions of herself walking around? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="397xUk"&gt;There are a couple of theories I can throw around, but I think the simplest answer is that Wanda doesn’t want anyone who happens to be watching her to think anything has gone wrong. If someone — or some government agency — were to look in on her activity, all they would see is a woman in her sweatpants drinking coffee and taking in the fresh mountainside air. Inside the house, Wanda is reading through a dark text literally created out of dark matter and in the dark dimension. It convinces people who try to wield it that they can accomplish unspeakable things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDvzwY"&gt;Except in Wanda’s case, she &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;pull off many of the spells within the book because she’s pure Chaos magic. She’s the Scarlet Witch. There’s an entire chapter just on her, as Agatha pointed out. In &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt;, one arc involving the book specifically centers on being able to prevent death. For someone like Wanda, whose last words to Vision were “we’ll say hello again one day” and is looking for her children, that’s a powerful spell to possibly learn about. If only someone could show Wanda &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt;! Learn from Anakin’s mistakes, Wanda!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHb6rx"&gt;Speaking of her children, we hear Tommy and Billy screaming for Wanda to help them. Unlike Vision, it’s very likely that Tommy and Billy were real children. It’s also very likely that they’re stuck somewhere — in another dimension, perhaps — and she’s going to try and get them back. I don’t think we’ve seen the last of Billy and Tommy. Alongside Cassie Lang, Kate Bishop, Kamala Khan, and potentially whoever becomes Patriot in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy and Billy could belong to a Young Avengers story — something that Feige has hyped up already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yp1CJz"&gt;All of this is likely going to be explored in &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;. Regardless of how Wanda uses the magic, she’s either the greatest threat to the world or could become the biggest ally. This should sound pretty familiar to comic book fans. As a Nexus being, she’s also key to Earth’s survival. Add in that Agatha literally told her she’s more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme (that’s Stephen Strange), and we’ve either got a big showdown coming or a wild team-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkfvcz"&gt;There’s clearly a lot more to come. &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeWandaVisionFinale030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is just one piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s giant, ongoing puzzle. For now, there are two weeks without any new Marvel series or films, and then we dive right into &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;. Grab some water, watch something that’s not Marvel-related, and we’ll see you again in about 14 days. The MCU is a marathon, not a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
