    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a room, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, especially as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; begin to ramp in preparation for the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6mj5"&gt;Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now. Be sure to keep an eye on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday hub&lt;/a&gt; as well, which will continue to highlight the latest Black Friday news, tip, and deals through the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BDRU5"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $50, the original list price. Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information for an additional $10 more, bringing the price to $60. Note, however, that both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices. Both can also be picked up with a Sengled smart bulb at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7P5bD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, are also offering the fourth-gen Dot at full price, with both retailers taking $10 off if you buy two — meaning you’d pay $90 instead of $100 for a pair. Best Buy, however, will also throw in a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum in addition to a Sengled smart bulb with each purchase. The same promotions apply to the fourth-gen Dot with the built-in LED display, which is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-clock-and-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795704%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYzQMDs5Oi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $60, the full retail price. The only difference is that Best Buy is not currently offering $10 off when you purchase two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently selling for $60, its full price, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. However, the retail giant is also selling a discounted bundle for $75 instead of $90, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502549%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is selling the Kids Edition for $60 as well, but you’ll get $10 off if you buy two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Like the fourth-gen Dot, you can, however, get a 25 percent discount when you trade in a select device at Amazon. Target is also currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939S1B5R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with the singer’s image pasted on the side for $230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 5 is currently available for $85 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its typical retail price. If you’re looking to save some money, however, the 2019 model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $40 instead of $80. Again, Amazon will take 25 percent off on either version if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6d2iBD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for full price ($95) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110 through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitors in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the Echo Show 8 to be better than other devices in Amazon’s current smart display lineup, which is why we think it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;As far as deals go, the first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though, there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $115, for instance, you can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 and a Blink Mini security camera&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $131 instead of $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-gen Echo Show 8 is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $130, its full retail price. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Blink Mini for $135 instead of $165, or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini for $260 instead of $285. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bA0Mnl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qe3Eto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Qus6Ft"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Mavic 3 and Mavic 3 Cine are incredible photo and video tools — for a price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QtmqPL"&gt;DJI may have a wide range of drones in its portfolio, but it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22759660/dji-flagship-prores-mavic-3-cine-drone"&gt;Mavic line&lt;/a&gt; that symbolizes the beginning of a new era for DJI drones. With the latest Mavic 3, DJI is introducing dual camera systems with hybrid zoom lenses, built-in SSDs, ability to shoot ProRes video, and better autonomous features. It’s a blend of pro-focused photo and video features with an easy-to-fly and easy-to-transport drone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDnigu"&gt;There are two drones to choose from — the standard $2,199 Mavic 3 ($2,999 if you buy the Fly More bundle) and the Mavic 3 Cine. Some of the mentioned features, like the ProRes 422 HQ video and 1TB built-in SSD, are reserved for the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine. And let’s get this out of the way: it is the best consumer drone for video and photography you can buy right now. But that doesn’t mean it’s the drone for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YP7ld5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10858104"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ffvyno"&gt;When folded, the Mavic 3 is essentially the same size as its predecessor, the Mavic 2 Pro. It’s a bit longer but about the same height and just slightly heavier. Basically, it has the same footprint as before, and you won’t notice much of a difference carrying it in your bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwVbZI"&gt;The wingspan and, therefore, the arms are a bit longer, which adds more room for slightly longer propellers. You’ll notice the drone is larger when unfolded. One benefit of these larger propellers is that the Mavic 3 is slightly quieter in the air. In my testing, the difference in loudness is -3.6 dB, but the pitch of the Mavic 3 has more bass, which is always nice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II1M9x"&gt;The new camera module is big. It houses the main 24mm lens and also this 28x hybrid zoom lens above it. It does stick out, which is both good and bad — it’s bad because it leaves the camera exposed, so any potential crashes might be catastrophic. Luckily, I didn’t find myself in that situation. But it’s good because this camera can tilt upwards by quite a bit — almost 30 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qPaZ5valqfmqgq2PPf-QNn_vDTE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003735/vpavic_211103_4871_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The main camera has a 4/3-inch sensor, and the telephoto lens has a separate 1/2-inch CMOS sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KYJOsD"&gt;One neat little new feature I greatly appreciate is that the gimbal locks itself after each flight so it won’t dangle around in transport. The camera cover looks like a muzzle and is downright strange. It’s made out of faux leather, cradles the camera system, and wraps around the drone lengthwise, holding the propellers in place. It’s an improvement over the gimbal covers that usually required an engineering degree just to figure out how to put one on, but it’s still a bit odd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eCOVq"&gt;As I mentioned, DJI released two Mavic 3s. I have only been testing the Cine version. Aside from the 1TB SSD, which, unfortunately, is not user-replaceable, and ProRes 422 HQ video, all the other specs and features are identical between them. The Mavic 3 can shoot 5.1K video up to 50fps, 4K video up to 120fps, or 1080p up to 200fps. It has 46 minutes of flight time and uses DJI’s latest OcuSync 3+ with 15km of range. Out of all those improvements over the Mavic 2 Pro, the one I noticed the most was the battery life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwJH-Mmd0w57Bmk2By-HkDEPf7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003728/vpavic_211103_4871_0059.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mavic 3 Cine and Mavic 3 both share a 46-minute battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaZHYy"&gt;It’s rare that you actually get the full 46 minutes of flight time, but it still is a significant improvement over the 31 minutes I’d typically see on the Mavic 2 Pro. As someone who is accustomed to maximizing battery life with each flight, I was pleasantly surprised when I’d glance over at my controller and find out I still have around 70–75% battery. If you buy the $4,999 Cine model, you get three batteries and plenty of flight time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6XRcn"&gt;Both the Cine Premium bundle and the $2,999 Fly More Combo bundle come with a charging hub, and the reason why I’m devoting a whole paragraph to it is that it finally supports USB-C. You can charge the batteries with basically anything that supports USB-C, including your portable battery packs or car chargers. Just note that each one of those 5000mAh batteries takes a while to charge, even with a high wattage charger, so plan accordingly. It took me about an hour and 45 minutes to charge from 11% to 100% using a 65W brick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiRb5v"&gt;This new camera module houses two sensors. The one you should care about more is the new 4/3-inch sensor, which is to say it’s a third of an inch larger than the Mavic 2 Pro. It is also a 4:3 sensor, which means your photos are no longer in 3:2 aspect ratio. With increase in sensor size, you get better noise handling, richer detail, greater dynamic range, reduced diffraction, and better control over depth of field — effectively better image quality all around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m6LxNmx4_oP3D93iPjl9nBctmK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003730/vpavic_211103_4871_0070.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both drones shoot 20MP photos, but in a 4:3 aspect ratio, not 3:2 as before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Pz9oVV"&gt;I have been impressed with how the drone handles noise at higher ISO. I don’t want to oversell it; there is still a good amount of noise, but the differences between the two drones have been easy to spot — for both video and photo. I still wouldn’t film over ISO 3200, and ISO 6400 is definitely pushing it past my comfort zone. You can get away with showing it on something like a phone, but it might not be suitable for larger displays. Chances are you likely won’t film with ISO levels that high anyway, but it’s good to see those improvements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvwDlL"&gt;But when it comes to ProRes video, don’t expect any major noticeable improvements.  Looking at the same clips shot in ProRes and H.264 codec, it’s very hard to pick out any changes. ProRes is really here for professional filmmakers who are dependent on filming and delivering assets in ProRes. For lots of other drone videographers, ProRes might be overkill. Besides, Mavic 3’s maximum video bitrate is 200mbps, compared to Mavic 2 Pro’s 100mbps, so there’s already enough improvement in video quality between those two drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VjxtJV"&gt;This new camera can also shoot 4K up to 120FPS. And personally, I usually shoot everything in 24fps, but I’m truly over the moon that we can now shoot 120FPS in 4K. However, there is significant cropping, so even while the footage still looks good, know that you’re not using the entire sensor when in this mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzsL38"&gt;When it comes to photos, the differences between the two drones are not as obvious. You might find it surprising that the Mavic 3 dynamic range is rated for 12.8 stops compared to Mavic 2 Pro’s 14 stops of DR — but that doesn’t tell the whole story. In practice, I didn’t really feel like I was losing much dynamic range between the two drones when editing photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ktDQEPKH_R4XfBNw8UtOP66d9tQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003761/image.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt7aBG"&gt;Cranking up the shadows and dropping the highlights in this single photo, there’s not much difference between the two, and chances are you really won’t notice it day to day. I know I haven’t. There is still a lot of information saved up in the RAW photos, and you can reveal a lot of info from a single photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUKJtW"&gt;ISO handling has also been improved. Some of the photos taken with ISO 1600 or 3200 look better than I expected them to. When comparing it directly with the Mavic 2 Pro, there are significant improvements with clarity in objects further away in the frame, and the overall noise grain looks a lot smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00O6MVnCLRw68vWHHHA--OpDlBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003776/fullsize_Iso_compDJI_0696.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISO comparison from 200 — 6400&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl7DH2"&gt;Upon hearing the photo specs for this camera, I was a little bit worried that we’re not getting much improvement between Mavic 3, Mavic 2 Pro, or even Air 2S. It was still “just” 20MP and rated for less dynamic range than before. I would’ve still liked a megapixel increase as I think the ability to zoom and crop after the fact is a lot more useful with drone photography than other disciplines. But there’s more detail available, even if you have to go hunting to find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SizV0O"&gt;It’s worth noting that the minimal shutter speed is 2 seconds. Long exposure drone photos are often hard to pull off, but I do wish that shutter speed was longer. Lastly, aperture is adjustable from f/2.8 all the way to f/11, which works for both photos and videos, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPfTcZ"&gt;Which brings me to the final thing I want to talk about, and that is the hybrid lens. To put it simply — I don’t love it. I understand why it exists, but I’m not convinced it’s necessary. It’s fun, sure, and sometimes you can find some cool things or just look around, but that’s about it. Don’t expect to use it to actually capture jaw-dropping videos or photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="1Xq12h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10858048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xhGTpp"&gt;It is an entirely separate camera mounted above the main camera, complete with its own lens and ½” CMOS sensor. It is capable of a 28x zoom or 162mm in focal length at f/4.4 aperture; however, the aperture number here isn’t as important since all the zoom is digital. You can’t shoot in ProRes with it — understandable. And you can’t shoot in D-log — less understandable. And you’re locked in at 4K or 1080p @ 30FPS. You also can’t take RAW photos, only 12MP jpegs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsvFzK"&gt;When you enter the “explore mode” by tapping on the binoculars icon, you enable digital zoom. At first, that digital zoom is happening on the main lens, and I think 2x zoom looks decent. Once you get to 7x zoom, that’s when the switch happens, and the hybrid lens “takes over.” And at that 7x, it actually looks good. There’s a big difference between the 6.9x on the main camera and the 7x on the telephoto lens. But once you start going to 14x or 28x, it’s really not something you’d proudly post on your portfolio. The overall dropoff in quality between the two lenses is a little jarring at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppD3ZP"&gt;There’s a new remote controller in the Cine Premium bundle; it’s very similar to the Smart Controller that came out a few years ago. It has a great screen, performance is snappy, and a redesigned OS built on Android is good. It doesn’t have exceptional battery life, though. I get anywhere from 3–6 hours, depending mostly on the screen brightness. Range is also comparable to the standard remote controller, which is an improvement over the original Smart Controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OlCrE6biSGlBX3tcXbywUfNFjCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003738/vpavic_211103_4871_0144.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned OS on the DJI RC Pro is much nicer and more simplified than on the original DJI Smart Controller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4g1a39"&gt;There are new obstacle sensors on this drone. They are still omnidirectional but fortunately not as sensitive or as obnoxiously loud as before. The app numerically tells you precisely how close you are to objects (in either feet or meters), and that really really helps when flying near objects. And, as per usual, they don’t work unless there’s adequate light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvVK1z"&gt;The new OcuSync 3+ is fantastic. I didn’t anticipate liking it as much as I did, but I really noticed a difference, particularly with the overall steadiness of the connection. Going behind buildings or trees wasn’t a problem as much as it was with many other drones I’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOBGzk"&gt;Last two things: APAS 5.0 and Active Track. I didn’t have time to test it properly because those features weren’t available during my testing period. APAS got enabled a few days ago, and from very little testing I did, I do like what I’m seeing. Mavic 3’s sensors are able to register objects as far away as 200 meters, and it really helps with how the drone predicts its pathway and autonomously avoids obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eObJ1_l6sLgxrJhCaFWAilOdpgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003733/vpavic_211103_4871_0090.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Omnidirectional sensors are not new for the flagship Mavic drones but are a lot more responsive this time around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gsgZKQgpZkRvTEDltzdsvO_5ac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003731/vpavic_211103_4871_0081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frontal sensors can now detect objects that are 650 feet away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mHdyX"&gt;But the Active Track 5.0 is still not ready. And DJI says it will be ready in January. It is a real shame. I have high hopes for Active Track, and I’m curious to see how it works paired with the upgraded APAS 5.0. I’m expecting some major improvement from DJI in this category. Everyone is waiting for them to catch up with Skydio, and that is a very high bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaIN21"&gt;There are things I was hoping to see in this drone after following years of rumors. One of which is built-in ND filters. It’s not here. Part of me was hoping for interchangeable lenses, and I still think those would be more useful than the hybrid lens. But I do agree with a lot of the decisions DJI made — increasing the sensor size instead of simply slapping an 8K sticker on the drone for one. And by enabling 4K up to 120FPS and adding ProRes video, this drone is now very close to an Inspire 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Otcwm4"&gt;But I also have to say that the product, as a whole, feels a bit unfinished. Aside from Active Track, some of the other features just weren’t available during my testing — including panorama photos, Mastershots, Quickshots, and hyperlapse. There is a wide-angle lens attachment coming out soon, but I haven’t had a chance to test that either. All the core features that were available here work spectacularly well, but the rest still feel incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goqmwv"&gt;If you can afford it and know what you will use it for, the Mavic 3 is an easy recommendation. Most people can probably ignore the Cine model — $5,000 is a lot of money, and if you add warranty on top of that, and if you live in a place where you pay sales taxes, that price can go up really quickly. The standard Mavic 3 is also not really for beginners — if you’re a hobbyist or prosumer mostly posting on your social feeds, you can probably get away with an Air 2, 2S, or even a Mini 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="u9V9Vu"&gt;But if this isn’t your first drone, and you’re ready to step up to a new level of image quality, want the best of the best in a relatively small package, and have enough computing power to edit these massive files — you really can’t go wrong with the Mavic 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Xwv6e1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10858121"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9DW9kQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3RnZU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ADM6i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX’s Starlink reveals new smaller, rectangular user dish to connect to satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BeTGF2gd7l76POoCr7_FFDI-dBc=/107x0:2354x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128513/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_12.14.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMj61A"&gt;SpaceX’s internet-from-space initiative Starlink has &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; a new rectangular dish that interested customers can buy to tap into the company’s growing satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. It’s a thinner and lighter weight option than the circular dish that Starlink beta users have been testing over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40rhkK"&gt;Starlink is SpaceX’s satellite internet project, which aims to launch nearly 12,000 satellites into low Earth orbit where they can provide broadband internet coverage to people on the ground — notably those in remote and rural areas where traditional internet infrastructure is lacking. With so many satellites in low orbit at once, the idea is to have at least one satellite in view over every patch of the Earth, providing near continuous internet coverage to users. In order to tap into the system, users need to mount a dish somewhere near their home, like the roof, where they can get a clear view of the sky (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;free of trees&lt;/a&gt;) at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GWtUnO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX had filed a new application with the FCC for a smaller dish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Ytyw"&gt;SpaceX launched the beta version of Starlink in October 2020, allowing users in certain geographical areas of the US to purchase the company’s starter kit, which included a 23-inch-wide circular user terminal — or dish — mounting equipment, a Wi-Fi router, and all the cables one would need. The buy-in cost was $499 for the kit and then $99 a month for coverage. Now, users have the option to buy this new rectangular dish instead, which is just 12 inches wide and 19 inches long. At 9.2 pounds, it’s nearly half the weight of the original 16-pound dish. However, the price to buy the rectangular option appears unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LTki1"&gt;SpaceX had filed a new application with the Federal Communications Commission for a smaller dish, &lt;a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/swr031b.hts?q_set=V_SITE_ANTENNA_FREQ.file_numberC/File+Number/%3D/SESLIC2021070801019&amp;amp;prepare=&amp;amp;column=V_SITE_ANTENNA_FREQ.file_numberC/File+Number"&gt;which just received approval yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. The 12-inch width notably matches the diameter of the antenna that rival internet satellite initiative, Project Kuiper, is hoping to build. When it unveiled its antenna, Project Kuiper claimed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;would reduce the overall cost of making the equipment&lt;/a&gt;. In August, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell argued that SpaceX’s new dishes would be much more cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufRr3a"&gt;“The ones we will have later this year will cost roughly half of what our current user terminals cost,” Shotwell said during a discussion at Space Symposium, an annual space conference, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-prepares-to-cut-starlink-dish-cost-by-half-later-this-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And then we think we’ll be able to cut that in half yet again.” Originally, the Starlink dishes cost $3,000 each for SpaceX to build, meaning the company was selling to users at a loss. However, Shotwell claimed in April that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/spacexs-shotwell-no-plan-for-tiered-starlink-internet-pricing.html"&gt;SpaceX was able to reduce that number to around $1,300&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqusjIfjgDB0UOPBjBb2O3XIr7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006108/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_11.24.31_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SpaceX / Starlink&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparisons between the two antennas on Starlink’s website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qTCHxp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.starlink.com/topic?category=10"&gt;The company’s website&lt;/a&gt; notes that the rectangular dish comes with a new 3 x 3, MU-MIMO router, which does not come with a built-in ethernet port like its predecessor. SpaceX is offering an ethernet adapter for purchase, however, for those looking to hook up their devices via cables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxxCOQ"&gt;Additionally, those buying the rectangular dish seem to have more accessory options when mounting the equipment to their house. &lt;a href="https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf"&gt;A new installation guide&lt;/a&gt; shows new types of poles that attach to the sides of housing, and even a long vertical pole that users can simply stick into the ground of their yards. The dish accessory guide notes that this option “requires digging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0lkn0"&gt;Starlink claims that “the rectangular Starlink is currently available for all new orders fulfilled in the United States.” However, it might be a while before customers actually see their dishes. After first accepting preorders in February, Starlink has steadily grown its user base, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556031/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-users-next-year-telecom-5g"&gt;SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claiming&lt;/a&gt; in June that the program had 69,420 active users. He also predicted that Starlink would have 500,000 users in the next 12 months. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22760268/starlink-delay-order-location-map-satellite-internet"&gt;users have recently complained&lt;/a&gt; that tinkering with their addresses in Starlink’s online map tool leads to serious delays in their shipments. Additionally, Starlink states on its website that “silicon shortages have delayed production which has impacted our ability to fulfill orders.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panic’s Playdate handheld delayed to early 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8dYc6XwiF4cs0b0RFlCxvX-QoQ=/0x2:1454x971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128501/F558C979_3BAF_4B2D_ADC3_CDFC275FFA64.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SwRWqb"&gt;Panic has delayed the first shipments of its Playdate handheld, which is kind of like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;a Game Boy but with a crank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/popagenda/playdate-2022-delay"&gt;to early 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that initial units shipped with batteries &lt;a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg"&gt;that didn’t work as expected&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to send the units back to Malaysia to get new batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIAPOp"&gt;Panic also said that it has been affected by the global chip shortage in a significant way. Additional supply of the Playdate’s current CPU won’t be available for &lt;em&gt;two years&lt;/em&gt;, according to Panic. To get around that, Playdate units coming later in 2022 will have a revised main board that uses a more readily available CPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdklB"&gt;If you preordered a Playdate, you should be receiving an email that says when your Playdate is now estimated to ship. Orders have now been put into five different groups, and your email should say which group you’re in. Panic cautions that its estimates are subject to change, so there could be more shifts down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ouRold"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The global chip shortage has had a major affect on gaming hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJxVH9"&gt;The news of the Playdate’s delay arrives one day after Valve’s Steam Deck was delayed by two months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;to February 2022&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;global supply chain issues&lt;/a&gt;. And they’re not the only gaming companies affected; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;Nintendo cut its Switch sales forecast&lt;/a&gt; due to the chip shortage, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22775829/sony-ps5-supply-chip-shortage-forecast-cut"&gt;Sony is reportedly making fewer PS5s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzMpGs"&gt;Panic also shared some news about Playdate’s development software. Pulp, the company’s no-code development tool, is set to arrive in public beta in January 2022, while the full Playdate SDK is scheduled to launch in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will let you easily share clips from its Prime Video content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82X3-rr72UGVphGZxYkBZyuTH30=/103x0:1218x743/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128465/amazon.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqEdCp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-unveils-interactive-clip-sharing-feature"&gt;Amazon has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll let you easily share video clips showing up to 30 seconds of some of its Prime Video content, right from the iOS app. The feature will only be available for a very limited number of shows initially, but letting users share video from shows is a very different attitude than the one displayed by some other streaming providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piZge0"&gt;According to Amazon’s press release, its video-sharing feature will be available on iOS devices. When you’re watching a show, the Share Clip button will show up alongside the rest of your controls. Tapping it will create a 30-second video clip, which you can then fine-tune to make sure it contains the part of the show you’re trying to share. From there, you can share it using iOS’s built-in sharing feature, sending it to a friend over iMessage, or posting it on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELNwqVoqrKxyFfg6wPJWSpjjGlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006021/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_09.53.41.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The share a clip button pops up alongside the X-Ray info and brings you to a very Overcast clip sharing-esque interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L7EUkQ"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a question about the feature’s availability on Android. Amazon’s press release says that the feature is “currently available,” but the share button didn’t show up when we looked for it using the latest version of the Prime Video app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdV2qs"&gt;It seems like an obvious feature for any streaming service to add — people genuinely like sharing clips from the shows they’re watching, and them doing so is basically free marketing for that show. However, Amazon’s competitors like Hulu and Netflix go in pretty much the exact opposite direction: when you take a screenshot while watching one of their shows, the video content just ends up blacked out, leaving you with just the subtitles if you have them turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ed-4LIQDGArfwCYyUyeUp9eCqcU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006007/IMG_3154.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out this hilarious scene from Netflix Original BoJack Horseman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lr1L11"&gt;While this is perhaps an understandable tactic for third-party content (Netflix’s download feature also has some limitations on which shows you can download), for original shows made by the streaming services themselves, it feels like a missed opportunity to let people do marketing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKraL4"&gt;Amazon says you can only share clips from &lt;em&gt;The Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Invincible&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fairfax, &lt;/em&gt;and season one of &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; to start, but it will add more movies and shows later. It’s unclear if we’ll end up getting this feature for any non-Amazon content on Prime Video in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MoviePass’ co-founder has bought back the company and wants to relaunch it next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IAlDPbUuAqVey3CNCeEGtWGHYZU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128446/vpavic_180125_2283_0037.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D7EGVG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iwantmoviepass.com/"&gt;MoviePass&lt;/a&gt; might be making a comeback soon, after Stacy Spikes (one of the service’s original co-founders) successfully bought back the company out of bankruptcy earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moviepass-cofounder-stacy-spikes-buys-back-company-and-plans-relaunch-2021-11"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spikes is hoping to relaunch the company sometime next year, although there are few details on that yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lBA1Is"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why MoviePass really failed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VTrhC9"&gt;“I can confirm that we acquired MoviePass out of bankruptcy on Wednesday,” Spikes commented in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “We are thrilled to have it back and are exploring the possibility of relaunching soon. Our pursuit to reclaim the brand was encouraged by the continued interest from the moviegoing community. We believe, if done properly, theatrical subscription can play an instrumental role in lifting moviegoing attendance to new heights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="google_ads_iframe_/4442842/business/tech/post_3__container__"&gt;MoviePass launched as original all-you-can-eat movie service all the way back in 2011, but skyrocketed to unprecedented levels of popularity in 2017, when the company sold a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150628/moviepass-pricing-subscription-fee-theaters"&gt;MoviePass dropped its monthly subscription to just $10 per month&lt;/a&gt;, a seemingly unsustainable deal that would see the company offering customers the option to see as many movies in a month as they wanted for less than the price of a single ticket in some pricier markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJUZwh"&gt;The company’s downfall only accelerated as the popularity of MoviePass grew. The idea behind the lower price (which &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-story-moviepass-rise-fall-2019-8"&gt;Spikes reportedly protested&lt;/a&gt; before he was fired in January 2018) was to leverage MoviePass’ larger user base to help negotiate favorable deals with theaters, gaining a cut of things like ticket sales or concessions. But that planed failed spectacularly, and by the end, the company was losing money on virtually every customer, stuck footing the bill for millions in tickets that it could scarcely afford. Attempts to salvage things by limiting tickets, blacking out popular films, and other restrictions couldn’t stave off the inevitable, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/13/20864873/moviepass-app-shutdown-out-of-business-movies-subscription"&gt;company shut down in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5yQrL"&gt;But MoviePass did help show that theatrical subscriptions could work, at least in theory, with major theater chains like AMC or Alamo Drafthouse offering their own (more expensive) services that offer similar deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVspB3"&gt;With Spikes back in charge, it seems doubtful that MoviePass’ return will feature the kind of impossible deals that the doomed service had offered before. But if Spikes actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pull off a comeback, it might offer useful competition to the in-house services at theaters that have since replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch is now on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTyO8Qha90Awtibew6HUHAa2NEQ=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128187/screenshot02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of Twitch on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="owQUeh"&gt;There’s now a Twitch app for the Nintendo Switch. It’s a free download &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/twitch-switch/"&gt;that’s available now on the eShop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3oMYd"&gt;The app is pretty straightforward. There’s a Home tab with recommended streams for you to watch, a Browse tab to look for streams by game or category, and a Search tab. I checked out a couple streams, and they looked great, especially on the Switch OLED’s screen. The app is only for watching streams; you can’t use it to stream your gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wijc-cfws2Vi5JjXquAoGuFDmLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005969/screenshot01.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s profile on the Nintendo Switch Twitch app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCeKSD"&gt;The Switch Twitch experience is somewhat more limited than what you might be used to from the Twitch website or app. One big change is that you can’t see a stream’s chat on your Switch’s screen or a TV screen, though you can scan a QR code to see chat on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y9wJg"&gt;If you want to sign in to your account, you fortunately won’t have to wrestle with typing your password in using the Switch’s controls or the touchscreen. You can either scan a QR code on your phone or enter an eight-digit code shown on your screen at &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/activate"&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/activate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS77AN"&gt;Streaming options on the Switch are still fairly limited, though there is also &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/youtube-switch/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hulu-switch/"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt; if you want to watch something in between trips to your &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; island. Here’s hoping we get Netflix someday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian “King of Fraud” sentenced to 10 years in prison for Methbot digital ad scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LO4s8ZUqqYYjmLTIACtESAJA4rQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70128073/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8dDsA"&gt;A Russian man convicted on wire fraud and money laundering charges for his role in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18115230/3ve-methbot-operation-eversion-online-ad-fraud-arrest-indictment"&gt;Methbot digital advertising scheme&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/russian-cybercriminal-sentenced-10-years-prison-digital-advertising-fraud-scheme"&gt;sentenced to 10 years in prison&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MF9j36"&gt;The Department of Justice said between September 2014 and December 2016, Aleksandr Zhukov, 41, and several co-conspirators made deals with ad networks to place online ads but used a bot farm and rented servers to simulate users visiting spoofed versions of websites like the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/em&gt;. The ads were never shown to human users, but Zhukov raked in $7 million running the fake traffic scam (which became known as “Methbot,” after the name of his phony ad network Media Methane), according to the DOJ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfLe82"&gt;“Sitting at his computer keyboard in Bulgaria and Russia, Zhukov boldly devised and carried out an elaborate multi-million-dollar fraud against the digital advertising industry, and victimized thousands of companies across the United States,” US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iys1OH"&gt;As part of the elaborate plan, Zhukov recruited programmers and others to help build the infrastructure that made the scheme possible. Authorities said he referred to the recruits as his developers and to himself as “the king of fraud.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sITp2K"&gt;In May, a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/russian-king-of-fraud-is-found-guilty-of-online-ad-scam"&gt;jury convicted Zhukov&lt;/a&gt; of wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy, and money laundering. In addition to the 10-year prison term, Zhukov was ordered to pay $3.8 million in forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="But9MD"&gt;If you still haven’t been able to land one of Sony’s next-gen consoles, Best Buy is giving you another shot right now. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYMoENUTqt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYMojat7P1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 digital edition&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUL1fG"&gt;Unlike some of Best Buy’s console restocks, this one is available to the general public online and not just for its TotalTech subscribers. Restocks like these may happen more frequently as we get closer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Still, we recommend heading to the link of choosing as quickly as possible to hop in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord CEO says the company won’t add a crypto wallet — for now</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2YRKh"&gt;On Monday, Discord CEO Jason Citron struck fear (or joy) into the hearts of Discord fans by tweeting a screenshot of what appeared to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570"&gt;crypto wallets in the app&lt;/a&gt;, but Wednesday evening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt; the company doesn’t actually plan to ship what he was showing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QHDkR"&gt;“Thanks for all the perspectives everyone,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699"&gt;Citron said&lt;/a&gt;. “We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now we’re focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.” Discord told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this week that the image was from an internal hackfest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8l8sbu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks for all the perspectives everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now we're focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jAzEHp"&gt;Citron’s statement doesn’t entirely rule out the possibility of some kind of crypto / NFT integration in Discord in the future. Based on Citron’s tweet, it sounds as if the company is looking into how it can use “Web3,” which is a shorthand that often refers to a decentralized and crypto-based internet, as well as how it can protect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683766/nft-scams-theft-social-engineering-opensea-community-recovery"&gt;against crypto / NFT scams that take place on the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpyzd6"&gt;The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; something similar about its interest in crypto when we asked about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772164/discord-nft-viral-tweet-social-media-backlash"&gt;a survey mentioning NFTs&lt;/a&gt; that happened to make the rounds just hours before Citron’s Monday tweet. Though that survey was apparently just for research, “we’re always exploring and hacking away at things we think will improve Discord for all the communities we serve,” a Discord spokesperson said. “This includes research that helps us learn about what people want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lN2EKn"&gt;It doesn’t appear that there will be an official crypto integration with Discord just yet. But don’t be surprised if there eventually is.&lt;/p&gt;
