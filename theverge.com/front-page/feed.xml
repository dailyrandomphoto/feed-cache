    <title>Testing sidelined as health departments focus on vaccination  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJpWh8"&gt;Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles was the biggest COVID-19 testing site in the United States, with the ability to test over 10,000 people each day. But two weeks into January, amid a chaotic and slow-moving COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the city shut down the site in order to convert it into a &lt;a href="https://californiahealthline.org/news/article/vaccine-ramp-up-squeezes-covid-testing-and-tracing/"&gt;vaccination site&lt;/a&gt;. The city closed another testing site, as well, temporarily slashing government-run COVID-19 testing capacity &lt;a href="https://californiahealthline.org/news/article/vaccine-ramp-up-squeezes-covid-testing-and-tracing/"&gt;by one-third&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKiIkh"&gt;It’s a pattern playing out across the country, in states like Florida, Nevada, and Illinois. Health departments are working with limited resources to fight COVID-19, and many had to make a choice: keep testing at the same level or focus on vaccinating. “We remain very concerned that there’s only so many resources to spread around,” says Lori Tremmel Freeman, the chief executive officer at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g460hA"&gt;Even before vaccines were available, health departments struggled to stay on top of testing and contact tracing. “That was before the introduction of the vaccine, and that’s another very complex, layered, response,” Freeman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uVI3Rw"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “There’s only so much staff who can do testing and vaccination”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYfxRY"&gt;Collier County, Florida shut down &lt;a href="https://nbc-2.com/news/local/2021/01/03/fdoh-in-collier-county-cancels-all-but-one-covid-19-testing-site-due-to-vaccine-distribution/"&gt;all but one&lt;/a&gt; county-run testing site so that health officials could shift attention to vaccination. In November, there were &lt;a href="http://collier.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/11/COVID19testingsitesandhours.html"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;. Staffing was the main issue, says health department spokesperson Kristine Hollingsworth. “There’s only so much staff who can do testing and vaccination,” she says. The department is now offering testing one or two days a week. “There’s still a need for tests, and we do get questions about it,” Hollingsworth says. “Thankfully, at least in our county, there are other clinics and urgent care sites that have tests.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqzdVa"&gt;On the other side of the state, the city of Jacksonville &lt;a href="https://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/article/city-converting-two-covid-19-testing-sites-to-vaccination-sites"&gt;converted&lt;/a&gt; two testing sites to vaccination sites. Fort Lauderdale converted &lt;a href="https://www.fortlauderdale.gov/Home/Components/News/News/5623/16"&gt;one site&lt;/a&gt;, which could handle around &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-fort-lauderdale-rapid-covid-20200821-qbfvrmum6ranfop64wv6jm475m-story.html"&gt;1,000 COVID-19 tests&lt;/a&gt; per day. In Illinois, officials &lt;a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20210119/dupage-closing-covid-19-testing-site-at-the-county-fairgrounds"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; the testing site at the DuPage County Fairgrounds outside of Chicago so that the health department could funnel support toward vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oso9y2"&gt;And in Clark County, Nevada, officials scaled back one of the main testing sites to &lt;a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/health/coronavirus-health/new-hours-at-texas-station-covid-19-testing-site-begin-jan-13/"&gt;three days&lt;/a&gt; a week before &lt;a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/texas-station-covid-19-testing-site-to-close-for-vaccination-transition"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt;. That site was running between 600 and 1,000 tests per day, says Fermin Leguen, acting district health officer of the Southern Nevada Health District. “The reason for that is because we didn’t have the resources to be able to open a mass vaccination site,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is a big challenge for any health department to be able to accomplish both at the same time at a high level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSV1qi"&gt;Leguen says that he hopes Clark County will be able to reopen the closed testing site at some point. “We call this a temporary decision, but it’s contingent on us being able to to get more personnel so we can keep offering the same level of testing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B85iHq"&gt;Pharmacies and health centers also offer COVID-19 testing &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html"&gt;across the country&lt;/a&gt;, so health departments aren’t cutting off all testing when they switch to vaccines. Department-run sites, though, are streamlined exclusively for COVID-19 tests and can process hundreds or thousands a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvLY2y"&gt;The relief bill passed by Congress in December included &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/covid-relief-bill-includes-about-8-billion-for-vaccine-distribution.html"&gt;over $8 billion&lt;/a&gt; for vaccine distribution, and that funding could help local health departments scale their efforts to vaccinate people. “Maybe we can convert testing centers into testing and vaccination sites,” Freeman says. Testing sites are running smoothly in many areas, and departments could expand on infrastructure that already exists. A drive-through testing center, for example, could add lanes for vaccination without shutting down testing completely. “We’re not reinventing the wheel, we’re taking advantage of what’s already been done,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxIu1q"&gt;The additional funding is welcome but is coming too late for health officials who are trying to jump-start their vaccination programs using their existing budgets. “Those resources were needed six months ago to help set up the systems,” Freeman says. “We’re just totally scrambling to play catch-up here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSmUiP"&gt;For now, in many departments, that has meant letting testing slip down the priority list. Testing is still critical to help identify people who may be transmitting the virus, Leguen says. But when weighing the two, the department believes that vaccination has a higher value for the community. “I will give preference to vaccination because we want to protect as many people as possible,” he says. “The sooner the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ALWYT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple execs discussed not ‘leaving money on the table’ when setting Apple TV subscription fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTVeQlKKKGmZdfkAYAHilJNHgk0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722856/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KBQY4h"&gt;In Apple and Epic’s ongoing court battle over App Store fees, one of the key sticking points has been Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21531873/epic-apple-fortnite-app-store-lawsuit"&gt;insistence on maintaining a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of the storefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkC3mF"&gt;But newly revealed &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20464232-apple-exhibit-b"&gt;Apple executive emails from the case&lt;/a&gt; show that the App Store rules that Apple flouts as essential to the fairness of the app economy were carefully negotiated into existence over time in a way that ensured Apple wasn’t “leaving money on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4w4jse"&gt;The emails date back to a 2011 discussion, which included Apple software and services leader Eddy Cue, around how Apple would handle subscription video applications on the Apple TV — an important conversation, given the rise in popularity of streaming services. And while the discussion doesn’t offer much insight on Apple’s existing 30 percent fee for the App Store, it does reveal how malleable those rules were when it came to maximizing profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRP3wH"&gt;The company examined a variety of options, including a 40 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent one-time cut, a 30 percent ongoing fee, or more individualized deals with services like the NBA and MLB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX3yid"&gt;One email in the thread breaks down the different forms of content partners that would be offering subscriptions on Apple TV. It muses on which partnerships would be fruitful to try to get a cut (like new streaming services) and which ones won’t (like “entrenched” cable and satellite companies).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHle-AJR8b0RE6LKcGd2N6UC2lk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260627/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.07.36_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lDBfdE"&gt;Apple’s team settled on the idea that any iTunes-based transactions or subscriptions should stick with the same 30 percent cut as the App Store. But there’s more discussion over how the company will handle referrals, where the Apple TV applications link out to a service’s website for customers to subscribe directly to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xM9m6i_UWcZYgJgw3MB4OnVDiMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260629/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Yb07"&gt;The thread then discusses how fees should work when Apple refers a new subscriber. Should the company insist on 30 percent of the initial subscription? 30 percent of the first year? Just insist that all subscription applications funnel subscribers through the App Store? Concerns are raised that Hulu Plus might not be able to afford that kind of cost. Cue responds that Apple should ask for 40 percent of the first year, but that it may need to work out a few deals first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdnLiY"&gt;One point of concern for Apple was structuring the new fees in such a way that they didn’t undermine the payment structure it set on the App Store. “I don’t want to do any deals where we get less than 30%. That is what it is on the app store and we can’t be making a different deal here. If that is not possible than I want a one-time bounty but we need to very careful here so this doesn’t spillover to the app store,” one exec wrote. (The emails are threaded such that it’s hard to tell who is replying to whom.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Cw0ALFI1PdfQ_VGLmANjLY2Jqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260628/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_11.08.01_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0jAV1"&gt;It’s important to remember that in 2011, the Apple TV didn’t actually have an App Store — just individual apps that Apple worked out partnerships with on a case-by-case basis. And the thread seems to emphasize the ad hoc nature of the platform development here: Apple doesn’t seem to come into this with any defined ideas of what it needs to make the platform succeed, just a vague goal of maximizing profit and shaping the rules for the platform to best achieve that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon Fios is experiencing outages on the East Coast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STHJWLoKzC7slsq44ZHqbze82kQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722836/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SK6kEZ"&gt;Verizon Fios, the company’s fiber optic network, appears to be experiencing outages in many locations on the US East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TPdUWQ"&gt;There are more than 22,000 user reports of problems with Verizon &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, and there appear to be hotspots on &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/"&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, New York City, Washington, DC, and more. A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers are experiencing outages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/seXuvG_la5wS6LQRhP7-imbOyDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260844/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.25.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Downdetector’s outage map for Verizon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, captured at 12:25PM ET.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zsiMLJ"&gt;Many people on Twitter are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=verizon%20fios&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;also reporting&lt;/a&gt; issues with their Fios service. Verizon’s support account has replied to some individuals reporting problems, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354113894688698369"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; it has been “informed of a potential outage in the area.” The account also said there has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354109889572982786"&gt;a fiber cut in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, which could be the cause of the issues for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2cgKX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have been informed of a potential outage in the area and our technicians are working to resolve as quickly as possible.  You may visit &lt;a href="https://t.co/MFnsE6wLnF"&gt;https://t.co/MFnsE6wLnF&lt;/a&gt; for updates once the issue is confirmed.&lt;br&gt;^DNS&lt;/p&gt;— Verizon Support (@VerizonSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VerizonSupport/status/1354113894688698369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="90C7DJ"&gt;People have also reported issues with Google, Zoom, Gmail, and more &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt;, but the reports appear to be coming from the same places that are experiencing problems with Fios. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.zoom.us/"&gt;Zoom’s&lt;/a&gt; status pages aren’t showing any outages, so it’s possible problems with those services on the East Coast are tied to the Fios outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANgNyb"&gt;We’ve asked Verizon to comment, and the company says it’s looking into it now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Alpha 1 is Sony’s new flagship camera with monstrous specs and a $6,500 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ronwrJU3_OfARnmB-eNHcBDfns=/84x0:1746x1108/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722506/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_10.57.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a0DXXo"&gt;Sony has today announced its &lt;a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/groundbreaking-sony-alpha-1-camera-marks-a-new-era-in-professional-imaging"&gt;most advanced mirrorless camera yet&lt;/a&gt;: the $6,500 Alpha 1 features a new 50.1-megapixel full-frame sensor, is capable of continuous photo shooting at 30 images per second, and can record 8K video at 30fps. It’ll ship beginning in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuoDsz"&gt;The powerhouse camera is priced significantly above the highest-end mirrorless cameras from Canon and Nikon, but Sony promises that customers who buy in will be rewarded with “the most technologically advanced, innovative camera” it’s ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzw78P"&gt;It sounds like a dream for sports and action photographers: even with its large sensor, Sony says the buffer lets you shoot “up to 155 full-frame compressed RAW images or 165 full-frame JPEG images at up to 30 frames per second with the electronic shutter while maintaining full AF and AE tracking performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMMxK6"&gt;That autofocus and autoexposure system can make up to 120 calculations per second. And you’ll be peering through a high-resolution OLED electronic viewfinder with a refresh rate of 240Hz — something Sony claims is a world first. The Alpha 1 offers five-axis, in-body image stabilization and a standard ISO range of 100–32,000 (expandable to 50–102,400 for stills).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="66smIx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0om2qHS1o4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qakWkx"&gt;Sony’s autofocus system is still perhaps the best in the game, and the company says the Alpha 1 speeds up Eye AF even further when focusing on humans and pets. And with this camera, Eye AF will also work on birds. If you can justify a $6,500 camera for your nature forays, Sony says that “optimized algorithms ensure that tracking is maintained even if a sitting bird suddenly takes flight, or the framing suddenly changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhIUqj"&gt;Flash sync speeds have been pushed up to 1/400 sec. (with mechanical shutter), and the silent electronic shutter supports sync speeds of up to 1/200 sec. Rolling shutter has been reduced due to high-speed sensor readout, and Sony says you can unleash that full 30fps continuous shooting without any blackout. Flicker under LED lighting conditions is also mitigated, as the Alpha 1 can match the shutter speed to flicker frequency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Y72G"&gt;As for video, the Alpha 1 can shoot 8K30 and 4K120 — both in 10-bit — and recording 4K at up to 60fps allows for full-sensor readout without any pixel binning. Adding an external recorder to the mix lets you capture 16-bit RAW video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyBMiY"&gt;The Alpha 1 represents Sony’s very best, and the price clearly reflects that. You’re looking at a price several thousand dollars above the Canon R5. But considering the reputation that Sony has earned with its full-frame mirrorless cameras past and present, there will be a lot of pro photographers itching to get this $6,500 beast in their hands come March.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PADRfM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro"&gt;Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s first smartphone with 5G in the US, is launching today for $2,499.99. Sony is targeting the device at professional users, who it hopes will use its HDMI input to turn the phone into an external camera monitor and its 5G connectivity to quickly upload or live-stream footage. Sony says it currently has no plans to release the Xperia Pro in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZjkgE"&gt;Outside of its HDMI input and US 5G support, the Xperia Pro’s hardware is very similar to last year’s Xperia 1 II (which shipped with 5G support in Europe but was limited to 4G LTE in the US). That means it’s powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor with a 4,000mAh battery, and around the back, there are the same 12-megapixel wide, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras. The Xperia Pro also includes a tall 6.5-inch 21:9 aspect ratio OLED display, which Sony is once again describing as 4K but actually has a sub-4K resolution of &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro/specifications#specifications:~:text=4K%20HDR%20OLED%20(3840x1644)"&gt;3840 x 1644&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although it’s got the form-factor of a smartphone, the Xperia Pro is aimed at professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEsgyn2odI1RSQUFDlj5JYHy0Bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260194/Xperia_Pro_40R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its HDMI input sits next to its USB-C port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwgCb2"&gt;At $1,200, the Xperia 1 II was already an expensive smartphone, and the Xperia Pro is over double its price. But Sony argues its 5G support and HDMI input could be incredibly useful to professional users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3TPgn"&gt;Let’s start with the HDMI input, which is located on the bottom of the phone where the Xperia 1 II’s USB-C port. (The Xperia Pro’s USB-C port is still on the bottom of the device, but it’s shifted to the left.) Sony says it’s capable of taking up to a 4K 60fps HDR video stream and should work with any cameras that have an HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sONXBY"&gt;In practice, what this means is that you can connect the Xperia Pro to a camera’s HDMI output, for example, and use its bigger screen to get a clearer view of whatever’s being filmed or photographed. You can pinch to zoom into the image displayed on the screen or overlay gridlines to help with framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or04Ek"&gt;Where this functionality gets especially interesting is with the Xperia Pro’s 5G connectivity, which enables it to act as a live-streaming link for your camera in addition to being an external monitor. The Xperia Pro can stream footage from its HDMI input to YouTube directly, and it supports StreamLabs and StreamYard for streaming to other platforms like Twitch and Facebook Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKYRzS"&gt;The phone supports both Sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G, and Sony claims that it has a unique four-way mmWave antenna array to maximize reception. There’s also a built-in network visualizer app that can be assigned to its shortcut key to help you find the best position to get a signal. Hopefully Sony’s software and hardware are enough to mitigate mmWave’s problems with limited coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k6EnE"&gt;Ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147066/sony-xperia-phone-1-ii-specs-price-features-5g-triple-camera-headphone-jack-wireless-changing"&gt;started teasing the Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; early last year, Sony has emphasized that it’s a device for professional users, and its $2,499.99 price tag makes this more obvious than ever. When I asked Sony why it hasn’t released a 5G device aimed at consumers in the US, it told me it’s waiting for the technology to be more broadly implemented by carriers. Until then, Sony says it’s focusing on professional users who it thinks can get more use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAiBCZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raya and the Last Dragon looks like a fantastical Ocean’s Eleven in the latest trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKzFawMt4jZGd29z1QZNzbN1Wm8=/517x0:2227x1140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721828/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.34.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uLJWUX"&gt;Disney has released the second trailer for&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VIZ89FEjYI&amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;giving the best look yet at the upcoming animated fantasy film, which is set to hit both theaters and Disney Plus’ Premier Access program on March 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6qb0f"&gt;The new trailer sees Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) putting together a crew of warriors and con artists (including a surprisingly nimble baby) to join her on a quest to find the titular “last dragon,” which legends promise can save her people. But, as the trailer reveals, the mythical dragon, Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) turns out to be, in her own words “that one kid [in a group project] who doesn’t pitch in as much but still ends up with the same grade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFleSR"&gt;Plus, the movie looks absolutely stunning, as Disney Animation once again takes the change to show off just how good it’s gotten at creating these CGI wonderlands. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zF_MNooPHaRfXHdSn-hDWIbVj8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260384/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.34.27_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mD9uqM"&gt;It’s a good thing that &lt;em&gt;Raya &lt;/em&gt;looks like a fun movie, too, since it’s one of the only major new films that will likely be released in the first half of 2021. Another wave of delays saw movies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The King’s Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/bob-odenkirk-nobody-edgar-wright-michael-bay-release-date-universal-focus-features-1234889942/"&gt;Edgar Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Last Night In Soho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/cinderella-ghostbusters-afterlife-peter-rabbit-2-uncharted-release-date-changes-1234678097/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more all shift dates to late 2021 and beyond. Other major films, like Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and Universal’s &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, are likely to move as well, leaving just streaming experiments like &lt;em&gt;Raya &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ HBO Max approach&lt;/a&gt; as the main source of new films for the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuw6Dz"&gt;It also means that the film — just the second that Disney will be releasing through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;Disney Plus Premier Access&lt;/a&gt; program, which will allow for subscribers to pay a premium to watch the film concurrently with its theatrical release — will be an important test for Disney, following a similar strategy for the live-action &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; release last year. Disney has yet to say how much it’ll cost Disney Plus subscribers to purchase &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, but when it released &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; as a Premier Access, it charged $30. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s midrange 65-inch 4K QLED TV is $600 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9sDbKVKWOzX7us_Z1bSyrLx8P4=/0x0:1217x811/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721769/vizio_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9CJoC"&gt;Super Bowl Sunday is less than two weeks away! Sure, the game itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242680/super-bowl-lv-4k-hdr-cbs-sports-stream-not-available-2021"&gt;won’t be streaming in 4K resolution&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean you can’t spoil yourself with a new UHD television for your bedroom or living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrCum5"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727833425321972223" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1607492-REG%2Fvizio_m65q7_h1_m_series_quantum_65.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250173%2Ftv-super-bowl-deal-sale-vizio-qled-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, you can pick up Vizio’s 65-inch M-series (M65Q7-H1 model) 4K television for only $600. It’s not the lowest price we have seen it go for ($580), yet this is still a great deal given the TV’s specs and size. Vizio’s M65Q7-H1 stands out (especially at this price point) because of its QLED panel, allowing for a more accurate contrast and colors, unlike televisions with standard LED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ed3hyU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RomItk"&gt;Don’t have room for a 65-inch television? Not a problem. Hisense’s 55-inch Class H8 4K TV (model 55H8G) is a good option for its spec and size. You can buy this particular model for $480 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-55-Inch-Quantum-Android-55H8G/dp/B085LR4NPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730515216541676425" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; $50 off its regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M3Avwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303440"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35YJLi"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are extremely useful if you enjoy blocking out all outside noise while you listen to music or podcasts, and Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are some of the best on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKJhAj"&gt;This model is back down to its lowest price yet of $278 at a few retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863FR3S9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426388561424168" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. But the best deal, in my opinion, is currently at Adorama, which offers the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html%3F"&gt;headphones plus a 20,800mAh power bank for the same $278&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZUBlto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="R3YbRg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple launches limited-edition ‘Black Unity Collection’ Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5TB_L4fUKGaUpDNooXD542-tBY=/0x0:1866x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721801/apple_watch_Black_Unity_Collection.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zgRt1T"&gt;Apple is launching &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-celebrates-black-history-month%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250242%2Fapple-watch-black-unity-collection-limited-edition#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a limited-edition Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; for Black History Month, with a unique watch band, new watchface, and some of the proceeds going toward civil rights organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHKEOw"&gt;The watch, part of a new Black Unity Collection of products, comes with a black, green, and red striped band and face, meant to reflect the Pan-African flag. It otherwise appears to be the standard aluminum version of the Apple Watch Series 6, with pricing starting at $399. The band will also be available separately for $49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HldCjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple also plans to highlight Black artists, authors, and developers throughout its apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnxlxE"&gt;The products will go on sale starting February 1st at Apple and Target. The band will remain on sale all year, but the watch as a whole will only be sold in February. It sounds as though the watchface will be available to anyone with an Apple Watch starting later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBACLi"&gt;Apple says it’ll be “supporting six global organizations” as part of this product launch, including the Black Lives Matter Support Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and European Network Against Racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvNgYc"&gt;In addition to the new watch edition, Apple announced a number of other initiatives for Black History Month this year. There’ll be a hub in the App Store highlighting Black-owned businesses and developers; Apple Music will get “curated playlists, essays, original videos” and other content highlighting Black artists; and Apple Maps is getting curated recommendations from EatOkra, which highlights Black-owned restaurants. Apple plans to curate stories focused on Black families and experiences in the Apple TV and Apple News apps and highlight Black authors in Apple Books and Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjpOed"&gt;Apple is among a number of tech giants that collectively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;pledged hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; toward racial equity initiatives. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287999/apple-racial-equity-justice-initiative-amount-cook-lisa-jackson"&gt;announced a $100 million fund&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020; earlier this month, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;create a developer education center in Detroit&lt;/a&gt; and support a tech hub for historically Black colleges and universities in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ next big event is a carnival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqZt0eMw9DmzEkG-S6zumD_Sg80=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721710/ACNH__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JwZ1zF"&gt;The next in-game event for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; will bring a little more color to your island. Today, Nintendo revealed its next big update, the highlight of which is Festivale, a carnival-like event that will take place on February 15th. Here’s how Nintendo describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XDs1Y2"&gt;Dancer Pavé will arrive to your island’s plaza to usher in some confetti and carnival spirit. On the day of the event you can capture colorful feathers floating on your island with your net and trade them to Pavé to receive a passionate dance number in return. Rainbow feathers seem to be an especially rare sight, so be sure to catch them and trade them with Pavé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SXDdAR"&gt;The event will also introduce new clothing options and reactions. It’s all part of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ latest free update, which will be available to download on January 28th. In addition to Festivale, Nintendo also says there will be new items based on other upcoming holidays, including Valentine’s Day and Groundhog Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXeCCO"&gt;Perhaps the most exciting feature, though, was teased at the end: &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is also getting an update in March, and it looks like it will be &lt;em&gt;Super Mario &lt;/em&gt;themed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hard lessons of the SolarWinds hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgnulylYAyfyEpPhE9FTHlWzQmY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721670/VRG_ILLO_4383_Decoder_Joseph_Menn.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity reporter Joseph Menn on the massive breach the US didn’t see coming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k3n519"&gt;In December, details came out on one of the most massive breaches of US cybersecurity in recent history. A group of hackers, likely from the Russian government, had gotten into a network management company called SolarWinds and infiltrated its customers’ networks. This access was then used to breach everything from Microsoft to US government agencies, including the US Treasury and departments of Homeland Security, State, Defense, and Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y2w8w"&gt;On today’s episode of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-with-nilay-patel/id1011668648"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; I’m joined by Joseph Menn, a reporter at &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; who focuses on cybersecurity investigations and the author of the new book &lt;em&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World&lt;/em&gt;. We discuss what this breach means for US security and the companies in SolarWinds’ supply chain that might have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TS8Uy"&gt;The SolarWinds hack hasn’t really gotten the attention it deserves because it happened during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174429/solarwinds-hack-russia-cisa-christopher-krebs-cybersecurity-infrastructure"&gt;the chaos after the presidential election&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s a big deal. And it raises a lot of questions about how to respond to such a massive attack and the responsibility of the private sector when it comes to national security. There aren’t a lot of easy answers here, but it’s clear that change is coming with the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgR7d8"&gt;Okay, Joseph Menn. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPRN0H"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8280732833" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7Su99"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from our conversation. A full transcript will be posted on Jan. 27th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMzR13"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=8xELQwgE-FFH9TICRxdYWFRvdkDK9pivZ7yZaVAvJ1vNiXShE_P6jhc328Rk8QZwZQ1o7rfbM-10iwPmxvXjkH0qM58&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1774.17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giOcvh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s complicated that the hack happened in an election year. The Trump administration, and specifically President Trump himself, is strangely cozy with Russia. Now, there’s a new administration. It seems like Biden’s going to take a more aggressive posture toward Russia. In the middle of all this, there’s the election security noise, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump fires Christopher Krebs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, who is in charge of cybersecurity. How does that all play into this? Is it “We didn’t want to say it was Russia too loudly, and now we’re comfortable saying it a little louder”? Is it “The Trump administration did not have a good cybersecurity infrastructure”? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJszXz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=LP7XQl81uhWOq3Ix5foDlTKnl28LD2LixsFDm6cT7w4zOvh7ErRULf9rLkk0suc_ewQ_xB5LnXDV6B2muiVVgJbZezM&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1816.83"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIR2Vh"&gt;I don’t think that’s something that we know yet. It may have been a bit of insurance on the part of the Russians that, under Trump, the United States government did not aggressively punish — particularly, the executive branch did not aggressively punish — Russia for a lot of really bad behavior that other governments would have done more about. There were sanctions, but it was driven by congressional action. So you don’t have to be a big conspiracy theorist to think the Russians believe, “Well, we’ve gotten away with invading Ukraine. We can do this big hack, and even if we get caught, this is the least likely White House in memory to sound the alarm and rattle a saber at us.” So from here, I certainly doubt that there was any foreknowledge of this in the administration. But from the attacker perspective, the US is distracted and has a president that’s less likely than predecessors to yell and scream and threaten sanctions if we are found out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEd8Bw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=7KnUu9FOLh8YzZCkt4N9WjKfrkjoZXP_8LHAZH1f-GGkWUVzZjXZdOQnOofWlFuKAhYzUCNgDKKLNSrv02qp1f3xApo&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1906.32"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VT18QJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve got a new president now. Has the posture toward particularly this act, but also Russia cyber operations, shifted at all yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjrkBL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=A56c8tcYQ0aC3IXEWVl5ewWiPhAf8ecSLtYAsOU8k2SldRcXt9S2Mpa8IgyfeX-kclP1QxuP5ptVYviZLupZYfn_XjI&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1920.87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puZD8h"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Sighs&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLP4IL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=I2pJBB9Kii3mI0GVcy_2upknC_DcQFyZfIWrswVMF99scZbNZ6pAsxqwDNZ5Y5ZeJlEmKzHjc7iEqimEdgIOxL6x3xg&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1921.79"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJxkXd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That was a very telling sigh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFjSJs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=giUIVIFI6OslOxE3qluthOJb_jouxlm7nzLF76hBIEx5OQEQMFq-fvJAS7NXvQaHShGdulRLq0G4LO9TTcE8BJdGD1k&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1925.97"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGtOMb"&gt;The administration’s been on the job for a few days, and in the heated political atmosphere, there’s a wide spectrum of noise before things are sorted out. During the transition, Biden said that this is something specifically that is going to be responded to in a big way. Some folks said this is an act of war. The people who’ve been at this for a long time and don’t have a particular axe to grind are not saying it’s an act of war. There’s no evidence of destruction. There’s no human life lost. This is classic espionage. It’s just that we got owned really badly. It’s similar, I mean, in my mind, to the hack of the office of personnel management widely attributed to China some years ago where they got classified personnel files on the majority of folks in the US government and outside of the US government with a secret clearance or above. That was really, really bad, but it wasn’t warfare. That’s an espionage win. And we’re trying to do exactly that sort of thing to China and Russia and other governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22vJ3Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=SewoTMneziGfECrYR-nfyyjLj2EeWTxkqHfr6n3aC2evEcoDQrxeHn1zMxZzsXk7XcFqwBX28oKo0OTe4SxDhIgnXt0&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2000.28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nV30Cd"&gt;But I think it’s clear that there will be some kind of response. There are going to be hearings on this, but like many things cyber, it has a lot of aspects. Like, “Are we sure that country X was behind this? Can we prove that to the world’s satisfaction? And then do we respond economically or diplomatically and other ways?” Hopefully not militarily, though I suppose that’s a possibility. And then, “How do we stop this from happening again?” And that’s really hard and complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEzMTn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=zzCOC1VhQ93cqiEVJeDfRsNeZzCZNLAN4YLNEuhJPZlhM6YlCYQTlOUg4ueAUFabyTvkpgi3TN7ozSWgBhFt-dCjYw8&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2055.21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0h7SY"&gt;It involves defense versus offense. It involves asking how you secure the supply chain. What do you do about employees in other countries and contractors in other countries? It’s similar to the trade war with China. Our computers and their software go back and forth dozens of times before they wind up on your desk. And it is pretty impossible to secure completely. So what do you do about that? Do you try and undo all these global relationships because you’re sometimes rivals? If you do, you’re going to hurt the economy in a pretty major way. So there are big thorny issues, and it’d be nice if the new administration and Congress take that seriously and come up with a plan. It hasn’t really happened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynoCsI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=WjAOkv6RBojKmVxMfSC5U_1lW7xMjnnojwFpfVGHqtGpGsrVVcOsmpPC-xUBOLwHAZPz9x_lA8SyxoOc9DSZDwcW3iI&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2104.16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMPC1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;breach of this scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, involving the biggest companies in America and the American government itself, is usually the thing that catalyzes change, that leads to a disclosure law or a reframing of the American posture toward offensive cyberattacks. But because of the transition [from Trump to the Biden administration] and the sort of instant quiet from the attacked parties, it doesn’t feel like this is that moment. Is there a group of people who are going to tackle this in the Biden administration? Does he have an appointee set who has the expertise to raise the profile of this again and build the political capital to actually make the change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sp1GCA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=sb7ApLyeKU1aehbFZRVv9sAE_Vec22rILC6OODikMi9RHYXSF_p76M7kR6-0hLgtC2snv8sEqH49nsSrBtCfbCZxYEQ&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2146.96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlBNsB"&gt;Well, that’s really interesting. And this is playing out in real time. Biden has appointed most of the top cyber people. As of this morning, there were one or two key holes. But among other things, for the first time, there’s a deputy national security adviser for cyber, Anne Neuberger. Anne is very well-regarded, was at the NSA for many, many years, and, among other things, was fulfilling part of the NSA’s mission to cooperate with industries on defense. There are a number of people who have really strong military and government experience. As of this weekend, the suspected new cyber czar inside the White House is Jen Easterly, who was one of the people that helped create Cyber Command as a separate unit of the Pentagon, the people responsible for running cyberattacks in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Wekf"&gt;So you have really intelligent, really experienced people. Do they have the kind of broad, blue sky, strategic thinking that might help turn around this really gnarly problem? I don’t know. We’ll see. The fact that both houses of Congress are from the same party probably helps, as does the fact that a lot of this isn’t that partisan in a terribly polarized environment. Nobody’s a big fan of getting hacked to pieces by the other countries. So I am more optimistic now than I have been in 20 years of covering this, but that doesn’t mean I’d actually bet on a complete turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3EMni"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=Rn9IFWyP19lfxrrg18uL7z68rO4YKdUiwDCZCWgz8mrPeF-sTsnLAoWbGg5I-vN73Cj_ab6kkMx3YlXfB2nl_217ceE&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2255.43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWFVrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you’re starting from a low bar, is what you’re saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPbZZy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=2vjeH1IPfz42BBs57dXrwGASAxJV9FjKBJnLy__LD2Csca4UzAGK36XSwRRXaLNp1X8_eZme56L2hUPQKHdn7zSMlV8&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2257.12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPZYvW"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOUiuG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=y9Hb7Vzrhsr5VE60hjCKMv6tXSQxRDLznT5gZnmTZlaAl-QtDdpNShkV3HuXDLUgvOo0b58An87AkZxV1iOEzlK_i7o&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2259.55"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qpnYn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that this looks like an espionage operation. What’s interesting about that is you come from Microsoft’s view of espionage, but kind of the way Americans would see it is, “Well, that’s Microsoft’s problem. We don’t need the government or the Pentagon...” or “That doesn’t merit a military response,” which is kind of what you’re describing. But at the same time, this is a major national security problem. How does that play together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sm8aJr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=0cSc3RUuszP57_Eb7q5EZL3SPRUX1bPoXOFkE-oRxnspGNLWf2_6mzoCqw4ifLNeiEaef1Okl7BMGoBLbEIYXi6HefU&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2291.73"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSZabP"&gt;So that’s a really good question. ... Very, very rarely do you see military response to legit espionage targets being attacked. But there’s the separate issue, which you hit on, which is like, is this a Microsoft problem? In my opinion, it is not fair to expect private companies, no matter how large, to fend off entire nation-states. The job of the US government should be to defend private enterprise from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3X9PX5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C8jxOk"&gt;It’s really, really hard when you try to get into the weeds on that because sometimes a nation-state will use the same techniques as a 16- or 17-year-old. So there should be some reasonable standard of defense that is expected of companies. But again, at the really, really high end, if the Russians got into NSA or the Chinese got into the classified personnel files, it doesn’t matter how big a company you are. You’re going to get owned if they really want you to. So that is one of the big strategic issues that I would hope that the White House and Congress address. Where do you draw the line? What kind of help can be provided? And what’s overreach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENJmyA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=lDCHJi3FW6YkbwdYmxThcoNru5-V3z9l-3H5vYwVs-_TbbPzaEDCUful-NMYvLxShTvpcmSbz8d9wuIM-vKeBJ3GsiM&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=3474.93"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaKJVU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think there’s a cultural shift with the new generation of lawmakers? I mean, we have some younger lawmakers now. We have lots of younger people who’ve come up in things like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in parts of the government. People are good at computers now in a way that maybe they weren’t so good at computers 10 years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1A0ev"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=lHpsezpX45TZIrWNZM1qXSX1rdcsh9gNPDrzAGpaUKXkb8da0B5K1acheb6mHcmVBVlCm6_YKn0bFFRTP5PApf9EG6E&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=3497.06"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7m4f3"&gt;Yes, this is one of the good things. I mean, in the olden days when I started covering this, the only good thing you could say about cybersecurity was, “Well, awareness is rising.” And now it’s true. There are people in Congress that actually understand. There are actual engineers in Congress. You still have a hearing where they drag in [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg and members of Congress ask embarrassing questions, but it is a big change from where it was, and there are tech-savvy staffers at all levels. They’re digital natives and they understand these trade-offs. I think that there’s a better chance than we’ve ever had of people having a real discussion about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="liAjLY"&gt;But again, I am concerned more about the establishment, the Four-Star Generals, the people running intelligence agencies, people in the White House who still think of warfare and intelligence in the old terms and don’t get into questions of the private sector versus the public sector stuff because there aren’t really straightforward answers. Right now, our government has been so dysfunctional that you couldn’t get the two houses to agree on pizza toppings, so how are you going to tackle something like this? I mean, the Chamber of Commerce, the private lobbying group, was outraged that folks in the Department of Energy and [Department of Homeland Security] wanted to put out voluntary guidelines for best practices to protect nuclear plants or power plants from hackers because they thought that was a slippery slope that would lead to more regulation. We can’t have that crap anymore. We need people actually willing to give and take and deal with complicated issues, or we’re going to keep getting owned like this.&lt;/p&gt;
