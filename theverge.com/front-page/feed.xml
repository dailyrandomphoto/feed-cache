    <title>Bose’s latest sport earbuds won’t block out the outside world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZ1UUvv6SAgxQYP-b4UDzCQyWTo=/1x0:2989x1992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68623026/Bose_Sport_Open_Earbuds__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;By sitting above rather than inside the ear, the earbuds let you hear what’s going on in your environment.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUuqXR"&gt;Bose’s latest true wireless earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds, are designed to keep you aware of your surroundings while you listen. While most other earbuds sit inside the ear canal, blocking out at least some ambient noise, the Sport Open Earbuds instead sit outside it. Bose has officially announced the earbuds a little over a month after their existence was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150405/bose-sport-open-earbuds-fcc-leak-photos"&gt;leaked via a Federal Communications Commission filing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4gwAyD"&gt;A design that lets in ambient noise might sound unintuitive, given how headphone manufacturers (including Bose) spend so much money trying to do the exact opposite with noise-canceling tech. But there are plenty of instances where being aware of your surroundings is a very good thing, like when you’re cycling through traffic or going on a run after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_JtjgpHeVo7S4aXBWiuiVrn_k4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22215377/Bose_Sport_Open_Earbuds.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds charge via an included charging base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RjHNLC"&gt;Different headphone manufacturers have used a variety of approaches to achieve a similar effect. For example, bone conduction headphones, like those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706156/aftershokz-aeropex-bone-conduction-headphones-wireless-review"&gt;produced by Aftershokz&lt;/a&gt;, vibrate against the sides of the wearer’s head, allowing them to hear music without having earbuds in their ears. It’s also becoming common for earbuds like the AirPods Pro to include some kind of “ambient” or “transparency” mode, where they use their microphones to hear ambient noise and mix it with music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P28NqS"&gt;Bose’s approach is a little different. Rather than sitting inside the ear like most earbuds, the Sport Open Earbuds “gently grip the ear’s outer ridge” and sit above the ear canal. Bose claims this allows them to work with “no ear tip, virtually no skin contact, and without the squeezing and vibrations from bone conduction.” It adds that only the wearer should hear what the earbuds are playing, even at high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZMqiQ"&gt;In terms of specs, Bose is promising the earbuds will provide eight hours of battery life on a charge, have a dust and water resistance rating of IPX4, and support Bluetooth 5.1. They can be controlled with a button on each earbud (one for activating a paired phone’s voice assistant and one for controlling playback), and there are microphones built into them for making calls. They come with a carrying case and charging base and can be controlled with the Bose Music App. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y9UMY"&gt;Bose is only releasing the Sport Open Earbuds in the US for now, where they’re available in black and retail for $199.95. Preorders open today, and the earbuds will be available starting in mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what we know about the Google union so far</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJgXuur0NZi0aDpmT9R7-3XRHv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622963/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lTXnOp"&gt;On Monday, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union with the Communication Workers of America (CWA). It’s open to employees and contractors at Alphabet, Google’s parent company. As a minority union, it doesn’t need to go through a formal legal process in order to exist. It just needs to announce itself. That part is done. World, meet the &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/"&gt;Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhNlj6"&gt;The news prompted a wave of support from organizers like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1346125551539548162"&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1346120251109359618"&gt;Ellen Pao&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346050124544233473"&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt;. It also led to some questions. What is a minority union? Isn’t 230 members rather small? Why is CWA involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bj902G"&gt;Here’s what we know so far about the Alphabet Workers Union — and what we are still waiting to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSLnao"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did this union come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSF6gX"&gt;Over the past three years, Google employees have been organizing major walkouts and protests to oppose the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire"&gt;work with the Pentagon on targeted drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;pay former executive Andy Rubin $90 million after he was credibly accused of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-s-project-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-triggers-protests-n960121"&gt;design a censored search engine for China&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, employees have stood up against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Google’s firing of prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;. Now, union organizers want to unite all of those efforts under a single umbrella. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWalkout/status/1346104231938416641"&gt;The Google Walkout Twitter account is publicly supporting AWU&lt;/a&gt;, although the efforts aren’t one and the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmrDRj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a minority union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRNThA"&gt;As a minority union, or a solidarity union, AWU doesn’t need to go through the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and hold a vote to convince the majority of employees to sign on. With the announcement, “Google workers are taking immediate advantage of the power of a union,” &lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;according to Clarissa Redwine in Collective Action in Tech&lt;/a&gt;. This structure puts the emphasis on employee organizing, rather than politics and negotiations, which can come later. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html#click=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2Fm2Qmjwz32V"&gt;Workers told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that it was “primarily an effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google, rather than to negotiate for a contract.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3ji3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the benefit of that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGyGYU"&gt;The structure allows AWU to welcome Alphabet contractors as well as employees. At Google, temporary workers outnumber full-time staff but often receive just a small fraction of the benefits. AWU wants to unite the interests of janitors and cafeteria workers with those of engineers and product managers. This would be difficult to do with a majority union. “Organizing Google as a labor union via existing labor laws would be next to impossible,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at Hastings. “Google would have so many advantages to avoiding recognizing any kind of majority union.” Dubal also says that Google’s use of temporary workers is likely strategic. “We can understand Google’s use of temporary workers as part of their effort to avoid unionism,” she says. “It’s an effort to divide workers, and avoid having to work with the majority bargaining unit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5fxSI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else like this in tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lipmsy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;As Redwine wrote&lt;/a&gt;, this isn’t the first time Google workers have unionized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pbay2z"&gt;In 2017, Security guards at Google and Facebook had their union recognized and fought through a long contract negotiation. In 2019, Google cafeteria staff employed by vendor Bon Appetit won their union election. In September 2019 a group of 80 contract office workers in Pittsburgh voted to join the United Steelworkers, forming Google’s very first office worker union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mSSVEG"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;workers at Kickstarter unionized&lt;/a&gt;, too, becoming the “first union comprised of white-collar, full-time employees in the technology industry,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;according to April Glaser at NBC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Kw2s"&gt;But Kickstarter is a small company with fewer than 200 employees. Google, in contrast, has 123,000 full-time staff and more than 130,000 contractors, making AWU’s effort unprecedented. If it’s successful, it will likely be a bellwether for organizing efforts at big tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc2w5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Communication Workers of America?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9car8"&gt;CWA is one of the largest unions in the US, with 700,000 members. It was formed by telecom workers but has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055445/game-workers-union-cwa-union-partnership-tech-video-games-organizing"&gt;branched out into game developers&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, tech employees. The Google union is affiliated with &lt;a href="https://www.code-cwa.org/"&gt;CWA’s Coalition to Organize Digital Employees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9WbXr"&gt;Google employees organized in secret for almost a year before deciding to go public with the support of CWA. As a minority union, it doesn’t need the backing of a larger organization. Part of the point, after all, is to avoid the bureaucracy that comes from working with a big institution. But CWA’s experience will likely come in handy when going up against Google management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBym8O"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And people like CWA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrwJlG"&gt;Not everyone is happy about CWA’s involvement. Amr Gaber, an engineer who helped organize the Google walkouts in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the organization was “more concerned about claiming turf” than listening to the needs of workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8swzrE"&gt;Kathryn Spiers, a security engineer who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;wrongfully fired from Google in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, according to the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/computerfemme/status/1346144349218889728"&gt;wrote that CWA has&lt;/a&gt; “a tendency to jump the gun and announce things early (they put my name in a press release without my permission) and this feels similar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsyuuE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are the goals of the union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57yP17"&gt;AWU hasn’t published a list of demands. As a democratic organization, it wants to hear from new members before deciding on major initiatives. But organizers have hinted that they’re not stopping at pay disparity. “Our goal with the union is to ensure that tech companies use their technology to make the world a better place,” says Alan Morales, a Google engineer and AWU organizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nLqSV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a union with only a few hundred members be effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGabhR"&gt;The short answer is probably not — but AWU isn’t expecting to stay at just a few hundred. When the union went public, it had about 230 members. Less than 24 hours later, it has more than 400. Organizers anticipate the membership base will continue to swell. “We are expecting more members over the few coming weeks, now that the union is public, possibly in the thousands,” Morales says. Still, with roughly a quarter of a million Google workers, AWU has a long way to go to reach a critical mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ao62Zi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We started today with 200+ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AWU&lt;/a&gt; members, the result of more than a year of intense discussions, one-on-one's, &amp;amp; other organizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We ended today, our first day as a public group, with over 400 members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the first Monday of 2021. We're going to keep it up this whole year.&lt;/p&gt;— Alphabet Workers Union (@AlphabetWorkers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1346254041714593792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9dtxM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Google responded to the union?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcyHSR"&gt;Google issued a statement yesterday saying “of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support.” But if AWU continues to grow, the company will likely change its tune. Google already &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;hired IRI consultants&lt;/a&gt;, a firm widely known for its anti-union sentiment, in 2019 in the wake of employee organizing efforts. That same year, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;fired four workers who were engaged in employee activism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlCbgG"&gt;This time around, “it’s not necessarily going to be as clear cut as firing individual activists,” says Liz Fong-Jones, a former Google engineer. “Yes, they will continue to fire individual activists, but I think the more likely thing is that activists will face negative performance reviews, being told that they’re not team players or that they’re not positive about the company. We saw some of those things with Dr. Timnit Gebru.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkFr4E"&gt;That’s going to be especially true if the union starts going after major strategy initiatives, like the company’s government contracts. But that’s also kind of the point. Meredith Whittaker, one of the organizers of the 2018 Google walkout, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “I’m not interested in a movement about what kind of tea workers have in the free snack kitchen. This is a fight for power over everything at Google — what they build, how they treat people, whether certain parts of the company should exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjJihS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Google employees. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft commits to fix Xbox Series X controller disconnects in a future update</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jFSs1HlgvWHx2bWdg3O3bk_Nk5Y=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622942/twarren_xboxseriesxcontroller_VLS_3632_2_11.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDG3Gl"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; feels like a huge PC-like upgrade for your Xbox games, but a fraction of buyers have been experiencing an unusual &lt;em&gt;downgrade&lt;/em&gt; as well — the new Xbox Series X gamepad doesn’t seem to stay connected to the console in some games and some situations, &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/xba_console/xbox-series-x-controller-keeps-disconnecting/16d9f462-57c0-4b6c-93fd-b03711e632ee?page=1"&gt;according to a 40-page thread in Microsoft’s help forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7x2hp"&gt;The good news: Microsoft knows about the issue, and a fix is on the way. “We are aware some players may be experiencing disconnects with their new Xbox Wireless Controllers and our teams are actively working on a solution to be included in a future update,” a company spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SfQc1"&gt;Again, it’s not clear how widespread this issue truly is — though nearly 1,700 co-signers on a 40-page forum post is enough to show it’s definitely a concern, that’s a tiny fraction of the million-plus units these consoles &lt;a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/446290/xbox-series-x-and-s-sold-an-estimated-12-to-14-million-units-on-launch-day/"&gt;were estimated to have sold at launch&lt;/a&gt;. And some of those reporting the issue say it only happens in certain games, &lt;em&gt;like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as you’ll see if you read through the forum or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/jsj02i/series_x_controller_disconnecting/"&gt;Reddit threads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J0khW"&gt;Even a couple of the video clips we’ve seen of the issue don’t seem to necessarily be showing off the same problem: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/k3737h/xbox_series_x_controller_disconnecting/"&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt; is a controller that doesn’t seem to be syncing to the console at all, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjallemand/status/1344461330997252099"&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt; is paired but not successfully sending inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8lxSxN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My kingdom for a Xbox controller that doesn’t disconnect at random. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NBfubjWnC5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NBfubjWnC5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Milton Allemand (@mjallemand) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjallemand/status/1344461330997252099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 31, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naggvq"&gt;Either way, it sounds like Microsoft will sort it out. And if you’re experiencing controller disconnects on a Windows PC over Bluetooth (rather than an Xbox console), there may already be a fix for that. &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/known-issues-on-xbox-series-xs/221c9d7f-dc91-4067-ba81-33ab671179b5"&gt;There’s a Windows Update you can download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0cfBE"&gt;Here’s the company’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s ambitious Minecraft Earth game is closing down on June 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xLpqGseSUsWrSscholUlT90gwGE=/159x0:1881x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622838/minecraftearth.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0kk4b4"&gt;Microsoft is closing down its &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; mobile game in June, due to the ongoing pandemic. The ambitious game had aimed to rival &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; and cover the world in virtual blocks for players to meet and play together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul3t7p"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; was designed around free movement and collaborative play – two things that have become near impossible in the current global situation,” &lt;a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-earth-coming-end"&gt;says the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; team&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we have made the difficult decision to re-allocate our resources to other areas that provide value to the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; community and to end support for &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in June 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmb5Y1"&gt;The final build of the game is being released today, which reduces the amount of time it takes to craft in the game and the cost of certain materials. It’s designed to let players craft and build more easily and safely at home in the coming months before the game is disabled on June 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHXx6q"&gt;Players will no longer be able to download or play &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; after June 30th, and Microsoft is deleting player data on July 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oS7Y8GxAjL6i6-b2keAjADFrjnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16280867/nwL4p5E.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;em&gt; aimed to cover the world in virtual blocks.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S2P1bg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18627341/minecraft-earth-ios-android-free-ar-game-features-pokemon-go"&gt;Microsoft first unveiled &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; in May 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to recreate the experience of playing &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;in the real world through augmented reality and to allow players to build virtual buildings out of materials. The game focused on social interactions with others, and it was part of a bigger effort across Microsoft to leverage the help of the HoloLens and Azure cloud server teams. Before the game’s release, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650201/minecraft-earth-demo-apple-wwdc-2019-microsoft"&gt;Apple even invited Microsoft onstage&lt;/a&gt; at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) to demonstrate the new title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irH6he"&gt;Players will now no longer be able to purchase items in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;, and any paid ruby balances will be converted into Minecoins which you can use to buy skins, maps, and mini-games in the &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5G54LA"&gt;“We’re eternally grateful for the amazing talent in the Minecraft community,” says the Minecraft team. “This was not an easy decision, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure you get the most out of &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt; before it sunsets.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ads made News Feeds in Georgia more partisan and less informative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ITyr2uQ9uyIp_fMX9eiQKvJtKzo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622689/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bCOkVm"&gt;When Facebook lifted its ban on political ads in Georgia, local News Feeds became dramatically more partisan and less informative, according to research published &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/05/in-georgia-facebooks-changes-brought-back-a-partisan-news-feed"&gt;on Tuesday by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkiTRW"&gt;Facebook banned US political advertising in the wake of the November 3rd presidential election as part of its broader effort to fight election misinformation. However, the platform partially lifted the ban on December 16th, allowing ads specific to the Georgia runoff on January 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp27TJ"&gt;To study the effect of those ads,&lt;em&gt; The Markup&lt;/em&gt; paid 58 Facebook users in Georgia to provide data on the content that appeared in their News Feeds in the weeks leading up to the runoff election. The resulting data (which is &lt;a href="https://github.com/the-markup/citizen-browser-georgia"&gt;available on Github&lt;/a&gt;) showed a huge change in users’ feeds when Facebook reopened political advertising in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AQ1jia"&gt;&lt;q&gt;news content was overwhelmed by paid political content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bUldmA"&gt;When the ban was in place, most political content on users’ feeds was from news organizations like the &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/em&gt;, CNN, or &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Once political ads were restored, that content was overwhelmed by paid political content from Raphael Warnock’s Senate campaign, VoteGOP, or other political groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJp4iB"&gt;Notably, &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; also found a specific instance in which Facebook was paid to promote false claims. The report highlights a $25,000 ad buy from incumbent Senator David Perdue claiming his opponent, Jon Ossoff, “is China-bought and would provide our adversaries with just another way to threaten our national security.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zrSZ9"&gt;As a documentary filmmaker, Ossoff &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/does-ossoff-think-china-documentary-113001723.html"&gt;received some China-linked payments&lt;/a&gt; when two of his films were licensed for broadcast by a partially state-backed TV station in Hong Kong. But the broadcasts were only a small portion of the overall licensing business, and the claim that his campaign is funded or endorsed by the Chinese government has been &lt;a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/jon-ossoff-chinese-government-claims-debunked/85-09658a41-08b7-4682-abec-92b4c862c2ea"&gt;labeled as false by fact-checkers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epFOut"&gt;The report comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213670/facebook-political-ads-georgia-republican-senate"&gt;multiple reports&lt;/a&gt; of demonstrably false ads being promoted by Facebook, often receiving promotion even after moderators had removed an earlier version of the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvIWYH"&gt;Facebook has long struggled with political ad policies, particularly during the 2016 presidential election when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/6/16263704/russia-election-hacking-facebook-ad-spending"&gt;a Russian influence operation&lt;/a&gt; successfully promoted multiple campaigns on the site. Competing platforms like Twitter have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966854/twitter-super-pacs-political-ads-facebook-climate-change-abortion-paid-promotion"&gt;disallowed campaign ads entirely&lt;/a&gt;, but Mark Zuckerberg has defended the importance of allowing political ads on the platform on free speech grounds, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/zuckerberg-defends-facebooks-political-ads-approach-after-twitter-ban.html"&gt;telling investors&lt;/a&gt;, “I don’t think it’s right for private companies to censor politicians and the news.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA tells US health providers not to modify COVID-19 vaccine dose schedule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="People queue at NHS Covid-19 vaccination centre in London as..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlPOAgsPmucOyvKgniPhERF40XQ=/1x0:4249x2832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622259/1230430316.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Krych/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VKkE7l"&gt;Health care providers in the United States should stick to the two-dose schedule for both authorized COVID-19 vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement this week. Some experts have suggested that delaying the second dose could stretch limited quantities of the vaccines further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2T3ROr"&gt;Any dose adjustments&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;could be evaluated in clinical trials, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9mG01"&gt;Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine takes two doses given 28 days apart, and the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 includes two doses given 21 days apart. Data from the clinical trials suggested that people had some protection against COVID-19 after the first shot, but the trials were not designed to test if only one dose worked. Still, the evidence was enough for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1345911427278671872"&gt;some experts&lt;/a&gt; to say that we should get a first dose to as many people as possible, and then give a second shot when more supply is available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cc5qd8"&gt;The United Kingdom, which is currently battling a frightening COVID-19 surge driven by the more-contagious coronavirus variant, is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/04/britain-takes-a-gamble-with-covid-19-vaccines-upping-the-stakes-for-the-rest-of-us/"&gt;taking that approach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/31/covid-vaccine-uk-doctors-criticise-rescheduling-of-second-doses"&gt;Health authorities there said&lt;/a&gt; that people should delay the second dose for up to three months. More controversially, they’re also allowing providers to mix-and-match vaccine brands in some circumstances — someone could get a first shot of Moderna and a second shot of Pfizer, if it’s the only one available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WZjyP"&gt;One concern in delaying a second dose is that a single shot could give only partial immunity. Without a subsequent booster to lock in protection, the virus could still infect people who have only gotten one shot and could hypothetically mutate into forms that escape the vaccine. “You are essentially maximizing the opportunity for the virus to learn about the human immune system,” Paul Bieniasz, a virologist at Rockefeller University in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/04/britain-takes-a-gamble-with-covid-19-vaccines-upping-the-stakes-for-the-rest-of-us/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiVaVz"&gt;Sudden changes to vaccine recommendations could also shake fragile public trust in the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C4VLZe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Regarding last-minute changes to vaccination strategy, I'm going to keep beating the same drum for a while. Please don't underestimate the importance of the public having *trust in the process* for long-term success. Social scientists - we need you! &lt;a href="https://t.co/IeiDZty4IN"&gt;https://t.co/IeiDZty4IN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1346191710888448000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A3MtP"&gt;The FDA statement should settle the debate in the US for the time being. “We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster,” Marks and Hahn said in their statement. “However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chmy9L"&gt;Right now, the limiting factor for vaccination in the US isn’t doses — it’s the delivery of those doses. Over 15 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been distributed, but &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;only 4.5 million people&lt;/a&gt; have gotten their first dose. Making more doses available won’t solve the current problem of getting shots in arms. The rollout has been slower than promised — the federal government left state and local health departments to figure out the logistics of vaccination programs, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-slow-rollout-could-portend-more-problems-11609525711?reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;the process&lt;/a&gt; has been inconsistent and confusing for both patients and health care providers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hades, one of 2020’s best Switch games, is $20 at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54B2uZQJcBH_ztXOTBDyMxiuoB4=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68622174/Hades_Wallpaper_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5V8K3"&gt;If you recently purchased a Nintendo Switch or received one as a gift during the holidays, and you want to start building out your game library, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; is on sale for $20 at Best Buy today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzyAJl"&gt;Released last September, &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;is a roguelike hack-and-slash action RPG released by Supergiant Games. Players control Zagreus, the son of Hades, who is trying to fight his way out of the Underworld. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eknCzd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hades is a roguelike with hot gods to kiss and kill","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7CrXWt"&gt;The game was one of the more popular titles released last year, winning Best Indie and Best Action Game at the 2020 Game Awards last month. Several of our staff also really enjoyed the game, including news editor Chaim Gartenberg, who said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"&gt;it was his favorite game of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oA5fsh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10267751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVYk7C"&gt;If the Windows PC is your platform of choice, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; is also on sale on a few digital storefronts. The lowest price you can currently find for &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;’ PC version is at the Epic Games Store, which is &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/coupons/holiday-sale-2020"&gt;offering one $10 coupon to users until January 7th&lt;/a&gt;; applying the coupon to the game at checkout knocks the game’s $25 price tag down to $15. If you’d rather get the game on Steam, it’s &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/"&gt;currently $20&lt;/a&gt; as part of the storefront’s annual winter sale, which ends today at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the Google union could boost labor organizing in Silicon Valley</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uU_DSsSzpOzvqGKiyA2k1RucKQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621972/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cfd8yt"&gt;Just over a year ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video"&gt;I spent some time in Austin meeting with Google contractors&lt;/a&gt;. They had been hired through Accenture to moderate some of the most disturbing content on YouTube: videos that contain violent extremism, including murders and acts of terrorism. Several told me they had either been diagnosed with or were suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The people I talked with made about $37,000 a year, and several had immigrated to the United States from the Middle East. Many found their working conditions intolerable, but they feared speaking out publicly for fear they would be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgPvfc"&gt;They were, in short, the sort of people who benefit from membership in a union. But with a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-kickstarter-employees-formed-union/"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, the labor movement has made few inroads in the world’s most valuable companies. White-collar workers earn high salaries, enjoy world-class perks, and should they ever grow unhappy, have ample opportunities to get lucrative jobs elsewhere. And the blue-collar workers who support and enable much of their work have been outsourced to companies like Accenture, making them ineligible for collective bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SfP3yl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the arrival of an Alphabet union, no matter how modest, seems surprising, perhaps it shouldn’t be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MBqEHf"&gt;These and other factors have prevented unions from forming inside the tech giants, even as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/7/21314636/twitter-nyt-taylor-lorenz-balaji-labor-movement"&gt;tensions between workers and their employers have risen across the industry&lt;/a&gt;. But not anymore: a small number of Googlers announced on Monday that they &lt;a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/people/our-union/"&gt;have formed an unconventional union&lt;/a&gt;, and if successful, it could upend labor relations across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbXcYR"&gt;The initial group of 230 Googlers is not immediately seeking ratification for their union, which is being supported by the 700,000-member Communication Workers of America through the National Labor Relations Board. As such, the Googlers will not have collective bargaining rights. But the union does include contractors, greatly expanding its base of potential members. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/google-rescinds-job-offers-to-contract-workers.html#:~:text=Google%20employs%20more%20than%20130%2C000,its%20123%2C000%20full%2Dtime%20employees."&gt;(Google has 123,000 full-time employees, and 130,000 contractors&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mW1nv6"&gt;Nitasha Tiku &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/04/google-union-cwa/"&gt;introduces us to the Alphabet Workers Union in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="n8WDmQ"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union will have an elected board of directors and paid organizing staff members, according to the group’s news release. Members will pay 1 percent of total compensation, which includes salary and equity. A representative declined to say how many of the 230 or so members are full-time employees versus contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlgJvm"&gt;“This union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers,” Nicki Anselmo, Google program manager, said in a statement that referenced the company’s decision not to renew a Pentagon contract to analyze drone footage after employees protested. “From fighting the ‘real names’ policy, to opposing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/06/01/google-to-drop-pentagon-ai-contract-after-employees-called-it-the-business-of-war/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29"&gt;Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who’ve committed sexual harassment, we’ve seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3o2jh0"&gt;If the arrival of an Alphabet union, no matter how modest, seems surprising, perhaps it shouldn’t be. Collective Action in Tech’s Clarissa Redwine points out that &lt;a href="https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/"&gt;organizing efforts inside Google have been building for some time&lt;/a&gt; — and have been met with increasing resistance from management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="F2OxUH"&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-five-years-of-fighting-google-and-facebook-secur-1828304237"&gt;security guards at Google&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook had their union recognized and fought through a long contract negotiation. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/31/21043467/google-union-cafeteria-workers-unionized-alphabet-silicon-valley-mountainview"&gt;Google cafeteria staff&lt;/a&gt; employed by vendor Bon Appetit won their union election. In September 2019 a group of 80 contract office workers in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/30/google-contract-workers-vote-form-union-amid-employee-discord-over-treatment/"&gt;Pittsburgh voted to join the United Steelworkers&lt;/a&gt;, forming Google’s very first office worker union. But shortly after these workers won their union, the company that contracted these workers to Google outsourced their roles to Poland, decimating the union’s bargaining unit in retaliation for unionizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCEksB"&gt;Since then, Google has ramped up its anti-union strategy. In November 2020, Google illegally fired four workers for organizing. In an attempt to further chill worker organizing, the company has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/google-employees-protested-security-team-interrogation-memo-says.html"&gt;shut down key channels&lt;/a&gt; for challenging leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/google-accused-of-creating-spy-tool-to-squelch-worker-dissent"&gt;tracked expressions of dissent&lt;/a&gt;, and hired an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;anti-union firm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EM53Ct"&gt;The subsequent forced resignation of AI researcher Timnit Gebru last month only further galvanized organizing efforts inside the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pf1mj9"&gt;“We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce,” Kara Silverstein, Google’s director of people operations, said in a statement. “Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IjAI7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;members now have a powerful megaphone for talking about workplace inequality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I8oIam"&gt;But Isaac Clerencia, a senior site reliability engineer who has worked at the company since 2010, told me he joined the union after coming to feel like managers had grown gradually less responsive to the workforce over time. “I feel like the culture has changed significantly,” he said. “It used to be possible to raise your voice internally and maybe get Google to change some decisions. [Now] it seems harder and harder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8cEnP"&gt;To be sure, the Alphabet union is tiny relative to the company’s total number of employees. Much of the early discussion around the effort has focused on how powerful the union can be given its unconventional structure. &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;’s Adrianne Jeffries, a longtime chronicler of Google, called it “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adrjeffries/status/1346141274634678272"&gt;relatively toothless&lt;/a&gt;”; Kathryn Spiers, a former Googler &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/fifth-google-worker-activist-fired-in-a-month-says-company-is-targeting-the-vulnerable"&gt;who was fired&lt;/a&gt; after organizing in the workplace, said Alphabet’s union “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/computerfemme/status/1346144351475429376"&gt;could and should be more radical&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdY2yu"&gt;And if the Alphabet union &lt;em&gt;stays&lt;/em&gt; small, its impact could be limited. But with a quarter-million potential members, and tensions inside the company continuing to boil over, I wouldn’t bet on it staying tiny forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRasPy"&gt;We’ll see how many Googlers sign up — and fork over 1 percent of their salaries for the cause — in due time. In the meantime, here are a few guesses about what we can expect to see next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RNQNF"&gt;For the Googlers in the union: members now have a powerful megaphone for talking about workplace inequality, and they can assume their grievances will get wide attention. That they officially speak for just a few hundred employees won’t much matter because Twitter exists, and there’s nothing a Twitter user loves to retweet more than a Big Tech employee calling out their employer. More importantly, union members will now have real legal protections as they continue their work — and new resources to expand their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqxLUl"&gt;For Google management: managers now face an entrenched internal opposition with added legal protections, a growing social media presence, and prominent supporters in Congress. (Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin were among the elected officials who publicly congratulated the group.) The union reportedly plans to weigh in on antitrust issues; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-04/google-workers-launch-union-escalating-tension-with-management?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that the CWA previously joined a coalition calling for the breakup of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. During a fraught time, Google will now have a high-profile group of employees working to undermine its favored narratives on a variety of sensitive topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iChiNG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it could serve as a model for organizing efforts elsewhere&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAASbO"&gt;And for everyone else working for a tech giant? I expect a lot of nervous looking around. I expect more &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/24/how-amazon-prevents-unions-by-surveilling-employee-activism.html"&gt;surveillance of employees&lt;/a&gt;, more consulting with lawyers, and more outright union busting. The faster the Alphabet Workers Union grows, the faster I expect these efforts to accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0ybSd"&gt;But Google tried those things, too, and in the end it didn’t matter. At least, it didn’t stop the union from &lt;em&gt;forming&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe the company can stop it from growing; maybe it can rein in the union’s power. But the union is here, it has big plans, and it could serve as a model for organizing efforts elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZhw98"&gt;Moreover, I’d argue that the very aspects of the union that make it appear weak — the fact that workers have to opt in to joining, that it won’t seek formal recognition, and that it won’t attempt to bargain for a contract — make it easier for workers at other tech giants to copy. It may turn out that traditional unions remain unpalatable, or simply unworkable, at most big tech companies. But a giant, legally protected megaphone to air your grievances with management? That might be something that a lot of workers find useful, in Silicon Valley and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4btki"&gt;I get why some have been dismissive of the Alphabet Workers Union, particularly in its initial form. But the trend within tech companies over the past few years has been for labor movements to grow more powerful, not less. Viewed through that lens, today’s news was probably inevitable. And the organizing efforts that began inside Google are not likely to stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon is taking over as CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L3G3AB5uV5DDj1Ecvtrtb5RGeMk=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621762/cristiano_amon_headshot_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRBrDk"&gt;Qualcomm is getting a new CEO: Cristiano Amon, who already serves as president for the company, will replace Steve Mollenkopf, who took over as CEO in 2014. Amon has already served as the public face of the company for some time, presiding over introductions of new products like the Snapdragon 888, making him an obvious choice to succeed Mollenkopf at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23LY1E"&gt;Mollenkopf’s tenure as CEO saw Qualcomm face numerous challenges: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363629/qualcomm-win-appeal-antitrust-ftc-lawsuit-frand-patents-chips"&gt;antitrust accusations&lt;/a&gt;, allegations of anticompetitive behavior, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18410985/apple-qualcomm-settle-royalty-dispute-patent-licensing-terms-high-fees"&gt;massive fight with Apple&lt;/a&gt; that saw the two companies sever their relationship (before patching things up in a settlement). But he also oversaw Qualcomm’s growth into the juggernaut it is today, one that nearly completely dominates the industry for mobile processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0dwKl6"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/3guY6dNe1shpzEl8rEEIKi" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 232px;" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvlvaN"&gt;“I am honored to be named the next CEO of Qualcomm and appreciate the confidence that Steve and the Board have in me,” said Amon in a statement. “Qualcomm is an incredible Company. We have been at the forefront of innovation for decades and I look forward to maintaining this position going forward. In addition to driving the expansion of 5G into mainstream devices and beyond mobile, Qualcomm is set to play a key role in the digital transformation of numerous industries as our technologies become essential to connecting everything to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="31eDgB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vergecast: Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon on the Snapdragon 888, the future of 5G, and Apple’s M1 chip ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169567/vergecast-podcast-433-interview-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-airpods-max-ftc-facebook"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jmtxO0"&gt;Amon is set to take the reins on June 30th, with Mollenkopf set to stick around as a “strategic advisor” for an unspecified amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
