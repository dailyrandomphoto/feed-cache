    <title>Ransomware attack on Planned Parenthood LA exposes info for 400,000 patients</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ulAUkJ"&gt;Hackers were able to access files containing personal information for hundreds of thousands of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles patients with a ransomware attack that occurred in October, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/01/los-angeles-planned-parenthood-hack/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/EXPERIAN_H1202_Planned%20Parenthood%20of%20Los%20Angeles_L01_SAS_1.pdf"&gt;letter sent to affected patients by Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; explained that the files contained patients’ names and “one or more of the following: address, insurance information, date of birth, and clinical information, such as diagnosis, procedure, and/or prescription information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5iQsm"&gt;Planned Parenthood says the ransomware was installed on its network some time between October 9th and October 17th. On the 17th, the organization noticed the intrusion, took its systems offline, and contacted law enforcement and cybersecurity investigators. By early November, it had determined what the hackers had access to but is still in the dark about the attack’s perpetrator, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tech/ransomware-planned-parenthood/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GExkxa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Planned Parenthood is still investigating the hack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZcgWd"&gt;A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood LA told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that it didn’t seem like the information had been “used for fraudulent purposes” and told CNN that it didn’t appear to be a targeted attack. But the data could be valuable if hackers choose to sell it, given its extremely sensitive nature — Planned Parenthood not only provides abortions but birth control, STD testing, and hormone therapy for trans patients, along with a host of other medical services. According to CNN, the data was limited to Planned Parenthood Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WguvL2"&gt;The cyberattack and data leak come at a time when abortion rights are especially fraught in the US. The Supreme Court is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/us/politics/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-law.html"&gt;currently considering a case&lt;/a&gt; to determine the legality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions 15 weeks into pregnancy (as opposed to the 23 weeks set by &lt;em&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/em&gt;), and earlier this year Texas &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033202132/texas-abortion-ban-what-happens-next"&gt;made it illegal&lt;/a&gt; to get an abortion after just six weeks of pregnancy. Texas’ law means that abortions won’t be a legal option by the time most people find out they’re pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PM23a0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This incident blends rising tensions regarding abortion, privacy, and ransomware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="deh26j"&gt;Ransomware attacks have also been a major issue this year, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728765/us-treasury-ransomware-payout-numbers-reports-2021-first-half-cybercrime"&gt;US Treasury reporting&lt;/a&gt; that payouts from the attacks could be on track to top a billion dollars for 2021 alone. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/01/tech/ransomware-planned-parenthood/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood LA didn’t answer questions about whether there was a ransom demand made in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to arrange for your digital legacy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cemetery (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L21amYXQFewHblgYg9I43krU7Jo=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70221033/shutterstock_13456018.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BiAC84"&gt;I’m about to introduce a topic that most of us would rather avoid: our digital legacy. In other words, what happens to all our digital stuff after we die? (And if your answer is “That’s not gonna happen,” you haven’t been paying a lot of attention lately, have you?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOzpkg"&gt;If you’re reading this, odds are that you’ve got a lot of digital stuff, both on your own devices and floating around in the cloud: backups, photos, tweets, Facebook messages, texts, you name it. If you’re no longer around to pay attention, these can hang around for a very long time — and some of it may be important to your survivors. (For example, who else has the passwords to your bank accounts and credit cards?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgTTqR"&gt;So let’s take a deep breath and discuss how to make things easier for your friends and relatives should something happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7BP3Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What happens to all our digital stuff after we die? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7dZmIj"&gt;To begin with, if you’re old enough (or wise enough) to have arranged for a will, then your executor (the person who is assigned to see that the terms of the will are carried out) will also have legal standing to access your digital assets: online accounts, websites, etc. This is specified by the &lt;a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey=f7237fc4-74c2-4728-81c6-b39a91ecdf22"&gt;revised Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act&lt;/a&gt;, which has been enacted by the majority of the states in the US. (As of this writing, it had not been passed by California, Oklahoma, or Louisiana; it has been introduced by not yet passed in Massachusetts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux7j0L"&gt;Since it doesn’t do your relatives or friends any good to have the right to take care of your data if they don’t have your passwords, you might want to think about entrusting at least one person with the passwords to your computer and / or your password manager — or think about putting that information in a secure place and let at least one person know where that place is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoXb0c"&gt;However, the Act does not apply to social media sites — which could be a problem. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include whom you want to entrust with all your social media accounts in your will, which can make things somewhat easier for them — but will still involve a lot of back and forth as they prove their right to handle those accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jpXx"&gt;There are a few companies that have added features to let you plan ahead of time who is authorized to handle your cloud and / or social media accounts if you’re not able to. Listed here are how some of the major online services are (or are not) handling the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zbgz1o"&gt;Apple iCloud Digital Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RbREc2"&gt;Until recently, getting access to the iCloud account of a deceased family member could be extremely difficult, especially if you didn’t have that person’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208072"&gt;recovery key&lt;/a&gt;. However, Apple has recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;added a Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt; to its iCloud accounts, which lets you name up to five Legacy Contacts who will have access to your account. The program is available starting with iOS 15.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY6lU7"&gt;To set up your Legacy Contacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xE6VMc"&gt;Go to Settings and tap on your name at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5thDh1"&gt;Select Password &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Legacy Contact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="65b3l2"&gt;This is where you can add the names of people who will be able to access and download your data after your death; it will also list anyone who has listed you as a Legacy Contact. Tap on Add Legacy Contact to add a name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A trusted friend or family member can access your iCloud account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tbjCTrerbFBnHb9YNQnXw7m5YQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058282/IMG_336C1C7F4E9D_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A trusted friend or family member can access your iCloud account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can add up to 10 Legacy Contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8XlGcXACpJpGrq7p5FwWDOHNkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058283/IMG_46BBD3E4A094_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add up to 10 Legacy Contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XkyQ1i"&gt;The next page explains that you should choose someone you trust, and that the person will need to have your access key and a copy of your death certificate. Tap on the Add Legacy Contact button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86OtX9"&gt;You will be presented with a list of your contacts. Choose one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BP5Cg5"&gt;Again, a page will explain what info the contact will have access to. Tap on Continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your access key can be shared via message or print / PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRH42kkkFepawmEQ89F6dthHzY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058295/IMG_86EF6F6C0BD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your access key can be shared via message or print / PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your contact is an iOS user, they can be messaged the access key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fCQQEqvXgNaobHa4kVQoZUsXdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058296/IMG_8DF1D0ECCD4F_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your contact is an iOS user, they can be messaged the access key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="LmabEL"&gt;You can now choose how to share you access key (which is a very long string of numbers and letters). If you message your chosen legacy contact with the access key &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if they accept it, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if they have iOS 15.2, the key will be stored in their Apple settings. Otherwise, you can print out a copy for them in hard copy or as a PDF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9r0gpE"&gt;Google Inactive Account Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TMOPg2"&gt;Google’s Inactive Account Manager is one of the more complete tools for taking care of your digital legacy — even if you’re just temporarily too ill to handle things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="exTeZc"&gt;Begin by going to the &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/inactive"&gt;Inactive Account Manager&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on Start. You’re going to go through three setups: when the inactive account manager will kick in, who to notify, and whether everything should be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s Inactive Account Manager offers a variety of options for what to do with your data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdOdnUfXRKSvNvgpNbKwH-vLNJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058171/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_2.41.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Inactive Account Manager offers a variety of options for what to do with your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="HDcEf0"&gt;First, you decide whether the manager should activate if your account is inactive for three, six, 12, or 18 months. You’re also asked to verify a phone number and / or one or more email accounts where you can be contacted. If you haven’t gone into the account, Google will then use the phone number or email addresses to contact you a month before your set time is up to make sure that you’re really no longer around (and haven’t simply forgotten you had that account). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can decide how long Google should wait before deciding you may no longer be around." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmCnRs6gjS6UnAfH84h_trS2LWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058235/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_2.46.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose how long Google should wait before deciding you may no longer be around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="T8eU9O"&gt;The next page lets you list up to ten people who should be notified by Google that your account hasn’t been used. For each person, you can specify exactly which apps they should have access to, ranging from your calendar and contacts to your Google account and purchases. You can also simply let them have access to all your apps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can specify what data can be shared with your legacy contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87g9LZWwcbouJWBvk6yWUiYHfUI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058236/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.15.13_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can specify what data can be shared with your legacy contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6M83ad"&gt;If you want, you can add their phone number so that Google can use it to verify their identity (and, rather eerily, you can include a personal message to send them). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OqrVrT"&gt;You can also activate a Gmail message to anyone who emails you after the manager kicks in, telling them that the account is no longer active. You can have the message sent to everyone who emails you or only to people in your contact list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you want, you can arrange to send a message in reply to emails." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Le5XrUDdvkkPpitbrQ05mF98TYs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058237/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.37.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want, you can arrange to send a message in reply to emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="jT7MjM"&gt;Lastly, you can arrange for your entire account to be deleted three months after it is declared inactive. This will also include, according to Google, any shared public data such as YouTube videos. (If you’ve named someone who will have access to your account, this will give them three months before the account is pulled to save anything they want to.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If requested, Google will delete your entire account after three months." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lLPvWnHP3N7FswAng_iyl6yRdSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058241/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.38.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If requested, Google will delete your entire account after three months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZgPOL0"&gt;Finally, you’ll be given the chance to look over your plan and confirm that this is what you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6GMZRa"&gt;Facebook Memorialization Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NRpASA"&gt;Facebook calls its digital legacy feature Memorialization Settings. It’s similar to Google’s and Apple’s — it gives a chosen person access to your account after your death. The only difference is that, because Facebook is often used to memorialize people who have died, there are some extra things of which to be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="kdWY3s"&gt;To begin with, on the Facebook site, click on the downward arrow in the upper right corner, and go to Settings &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Settings. Make sure you’re in the General section (the first category in the left hand column) and select Memorialization Settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook lets you choose a friend to manage your account posthumously." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yPYh1ZeMBhnSPL83JlCTAIY9KQ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058172/Screen_Shot_2021_12_01_at_3.46.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook lets you choose a friend to manage your account posthumously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gCNkwr"&gt;The page will open up to explain that you can choose a legacy contact who will be able to manage tribute posts on your site, delete your site, accept new friends, and update your profile. The person you choose will be contacted by Facebook, so it’s probably a good idea to talk to them about it beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="abtQSz"&gt;You can also choose to have your account permanently deleted via a link at the bottom of that page. If you don’t choose that, then as soon as Facebook finds out you’re no longer alive, it will “memorialize” your account. That means that the word “Remembering” will be placed on your page, your content will remain, and friends can leave messages on the timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PXZYza"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yEkyHW"&gt;Twitter doesn’t provide any way to posthumously transfer your account to a family member or friend. Somebody who wants to close down the account of a deceased Twitter user will have to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/contact-twitter-about-a-deceased-family-members-account"&gt;fill out a form&lt;/a&gt; and then send in a pile of paperwork, including their own ID and a death certificate. They will not be allowed access to the account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter will let a survivor delete your account assuming they have the right paperwork." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rdgO0tiShN0fogTSOkycuGwJ8A0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058247/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_11.48.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter will let a survivor delete your account assuming they have the right paperwork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NyOTvr"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="19RHFA"&gt;Like Twitter, Instagram offers no way to plan ahead of time who will have access to your account or what they’ll do with it. Instead, &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/264154560391256/"&gt;the site will memorialize the account&lt;/a&gt; once it receives proof, such as a newspaper clipping or a death certificate. Family members can also request that an account be closed if they have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/1474899482730688"&gt;the proper proof&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fill out this form to turn someone’s Instagram account into a memorial." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fGNpnlsWab57F7zAXn2YVg4sfT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058250/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_11.49.55_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fill out this form to turn someone’s Instagram account into a memorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9qY3wa"&gt;As of this writing, there are no other social media sites that I know of that have any specific features for what happens when a user is no longer around. Instead, executors, family members, or others with legal standing will have to provide the paperwork needed to enable an account to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSaqgN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWKOj0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of Arm&lt;/a&gt; just ran into another massive hurdle: the Federal Trade Commission, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger"&gt;which announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s suing to block the merger from going through due to concerns that the combined companies would “stifle competing next-generation technologies.” The suit comes after an FTC investigation into the deal following complaints from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the merger was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXgnue"&gt;“The FTC is suing to block the largest semiconductor chip merger in history to prevent a chip conglomerate from stifling the innovation pipeline for next-generation technologies,” said FTC Bureau of Competition director Holly Vedova in a statement. “Tomorrow’s technologies depend on preserving today’s competitive, cutting-edge chip markets. This proposed deal would distort Arm’s incentives in chip markets and allow the combined firm to unfairly undermine Nvidia’s rivals. The FTC’s lawsuit should send a strong signal that we will act aggressively to protect our critical infrastructure markets from illegal vertical mergers that have far-reaching and damaging effects on future innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l07HMq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Another major regulatory roadblock for Nvidia and Arm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0QpzA"&gt;The FTC’s complaint notes that Nvidia already uses Arm-based products for several areas, including high-level advanced driver systems for vehicles, Arm-based CPUs for cloud computing, and DPU SmartNICs (networking products used in datacenters). The concern is that by acquiring Arm, Nvidia would gain an unfair advantage in those markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He1tVT"&gt;Additionally, the FTC raises concerns that Nvidia would gain access to sensitive information from Arm licensees who already compete with Nvidia, in addition to de-incentivizing Arm from working on new products and designs that would conflict with Nvidia’s own interests by benefiting competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQY0nR"&gt;For its part, Nvidia has promised that it would keep Arm’s existing open licensing model, which sees the company provide semiconductor designs to a massive list of companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Amazon, and more. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote at the time in a &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; editorial&lt;/a&gt; that he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w4mCsj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia is acquiring Arm for $40 billion ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"},{"title":"Nvidia’s $40 billion Arm acquisition is about bringing AI down from the cloud","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"},{"title":"EU opens formal investigation into Nvidia’s Arm acquisition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger"},{"title":"Nvidia’s Arm acquisition undergoes more scrutiny by the UK government ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785832/nvidias-arm-acquisition-scrutiny-uk-government"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DkU8XJ"&gt;The FTC isn’t the only regulator closely examining the $40 billion deal: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22266504/nvidia-arm-deal-eu-formal-investigation-merger"&gt;the European Union opened a formal investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the deal in October, while the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785832/nvidias-arm-acquisition-scrutiny-uk-government"&gt;started a more in-depth examination&lt;/a&gt; of potential national security risks and competition concerns last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek2fOT"&gt;Huang &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632017/nvidia-acquisition-arm-timeframe-18-months-schedule-regulatory-scrutiny"&gt;acknowledged back in August&lt;/a&gt; that the regulatory review would likely take longer than the company’s originally estimated 18-month timeframe but &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “[we’re] confident in the deal, we’re confident regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition.” The original plan was for the merger to be completed by March 2022 (although Nvidia’s deal with Softbank gives it until the end of the year to clear things with regulators). But with the FTC now suing to block the deal, it seems that Nvidia and Arm’s list of hurdles has just gotten much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA puts Apex Legends boss in charge of Battlefield as part of internal shakeup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electronic Arts Inc. Event Ahead Of 2019 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPcLpNjP25-drNA9KO4inO-pqlQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220752/1148645918.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I2kMz3"&gt;EA is making a big change to the management of the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; franchise by putting Vince Zampella, the CEO of &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends-&lt;/em&gt;maker Respawn Entertainment, in charge of the series, according to &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-franchise-undergoes-major-shake-up/1100-6498521/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; article published Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBvkiI"&gt;Alongside Zampella’s new oversight of the franchise, EA plans to build an &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-to-build-a-connected-battlefield-universe-more-experiences-on-the-way/1100-6498518/"&gt;interconnected &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, he told &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;. To help support that, EA is creating a new Seattle-based team focused on “injecting more storytelling into the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; universe” headed up by &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; veteran Marcus Lehto, while Ripple Effect, which made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587667/battlefield-2042-portal-custom-game-modes-vehicles-weapons-maps-ea-play"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042’s &lt;/em&gt;customizable Portal mode&lt;/a&gt;, is working on a “new &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; experience in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; universe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5DVbmA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes arrive shortly after Battlefield 2042’s rocky launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OnVi1r"&gt;The changes arrive shortly after the November 19th worldwide launch of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, which has been rocky. The multiplayer-only game released with &lt;a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-bugs-fixes-known-issues"&gt;some significant bugs&lt;/a&gt;, and EA has released &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-1"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-2"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to clean things up. But the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042’s&lt;/em&gt; Steam player count has already &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/battlefield-2042-player-count-steam-drop-70-percent/"&gt;dropped 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; since the launch, which could be a worrying signal that people are already moving on from one of EA’s biggest titles of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptoyGH"&gt;Zampella’s new role could indicate that EA wants to inject some of what’s made the free-to-play battle royale shooter &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-is-crushing-its-concurrent-playercount-record-on-steam/"&gt;so successful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;into the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; franchise. While Zampella didn’t confirm to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; will be going free-to-play, he did say EA is “exploring every possibility.” And as both &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391634/apex-legends-mobile-beta"&gt;coming to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396717/ea-battlefield-mobile-smartphones-tablets-2022"&gt;smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps EA is considering similar strategies for expanding each series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibNbvT"&gt;As part of the shakeup, Dice’s GM, Oskar Gabrielson, is departing the company to “pursue a new endeavor outside of EA,” according to &lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;. “I’ll be here to support the transition over the next few months before I head out on my new adventure,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ogabrielson/status/1466452724258590726"&gt;Gabrielson said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="64pF2l"&gt;If you didn’t know that tool manufacturer DeWalt made wireless headphones, don’t worry — we hadn’t either until they started catching on fire. The DeWalt-branded Jobsite Pro Wireless Earphones are being &lt;a href="https://www.efilliate.com/notices/DXMA1902091/"&gt;recalled&lt;/a&gt; by manufacturer E-filliate for safety concerns of overheating. The company said the recall affects about 301,000 units, which were were sold in stores including Home Depot and Lowes between December 2019 and July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcfoV7"&gt;The US Consumer Product Safety Commission &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/E-filliate-Recalls-DEWALT-Wireless-Earphones-Due-to-Burn-and-Fire-Hazards"&gt;announced the recall&lt;/a&gt; on December 1st and said there had been 61 reports of the headphones overheating, including five fire incidents and four minor burn injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOaq7s"&gt;E-filliate says customers can &lt;a href="https://www.efilliate.com/notices/DXMA1902091/CustForm.aspx"&gt;contact the company&lt;/a&gt; for a free replacement of its $60 headsets but did not mention what the replacements would be. E-filliate didn’t reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge &lt;/em&gt;seeking details about whether the headphones would be remanufactured with design corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yUQieP"&gt;

    <title>Google is making its first in-house smartwatch that could launch in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSj6AWH51d9fuXAwcg0q_NOLAK0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220489/akrales_190822_3612_0135.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not the new watch; we have not seen the new watch yet.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5qfq83"&gt;Google is finally making its own in-house smartwatch that’s set to launch in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pixel-watch-rohan-android-smartwatch-development-fitbit-launch-2021-12"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGr9L4"&gt;While Google has made its own smartphones for years under the Pixel line (which has since extended to other accessories, like wireless headphones), the company has never designed its own smartwatch, despite the fact that Google has had a companion wearable platform for Android since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZHV5Mj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"It’s time for the Pixel Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736665/google-pixel-watch-smartwatch-hardware-fitbit-wear-os"},{"title":"The Galaxy Watch 4 is still more a Samsung wearable than a Google one","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620869/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-3-samsung-wearable-google-smartwatch-tizen-one-ui"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="79NONM"&gt;The watch is being worked on by Google’s Pixel hardware group separately from Fitbit, which Google bought for $2.1 billion earlier this year. According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report, the new upcoming Google watch — it’s not clear whether Google will actually be calling it a “Pixel Watch” yet — will serve much the same role as the Pixel phones do for Android: an example for both consumers and hardware partners of what Google’s software is truly capable of when given the right hardware. The device is expected to cost more than a Fitbit and compete more directly with the Apple Watch, according to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VMxeY"&gt;The watch will have basic fitness tracking features, including step counting and a heart rate monitor, with Google also reportedly working on debuting a Fitbit integration into Wear OS (codenamed “Nightlight”) with the new watch when it launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJ6auo"&gt;Google is currently in the middle of the latest reinvention of its smartwatch platform with Wear OS 3. Unlike the earlier versions of Wear OS (or Android Wear), Wear OS 3 was developed as a partnership with Samsung, merging the Tizen platform into Google’s own. But so far, Wear OS 3 has only launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt;, which runs a heavily customized version of the new operating system that eschews most of Google’s services and apps for Samsung’s own. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Most of the pre-installed apps on the Galaxy Watch 4 come from Samsung." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrznZlqdrp50UtpFcuoRBVtmXaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787996/dbohn_210816_4717_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7oXpaT"&gt;Google nearly had a “Pixel Watch” in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872740/google-pixel-smartwatch-flagship-why-it-failed-wear-os"&gt;according to a 2019 report&lt;/a&gt;. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style, released in 2017, were originally supposed to be marketed as part of the Pixel brand, but an employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh axed the idea because they “didn’t look like what belonged in the Pixel family.” Both devices didn’t impress us when they came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBnmGJ"&gt;The news of a Google-built smartwatch isn’t a complete surprise, however. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Osterloh told&lt;em&gt; The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that an in-house Wear OS wearable was already on the horizon, noting at the time that Google’s acquisition of Fitbit was still “pretty early in the integration.” Osterloh did mention that “you’ll see them [the Fitbit team] build wearables on Wear OS in the future,” with the team already “hard at work at that,” — although it’s not clear whether Osterloh was referring to the Rohan watch or a different, future product. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My friend said this picture makes me look like Hide the Pain Harold. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74wCWZ"&gt;Following the news that Square is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral"&gt;changing its name to Block&lt;/a&gt;, people started noticing (read: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1466273784894132227"&gt;making fun of&lt;/a&gt;) the company’s new &lt;a href="https://investors.block.xyz/governance/leadership/default.aspx"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://investors.block.xyz/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx"&gt;board of directors&lt;/a&gt; pages. While Block is still the same financial company that operates Cash App and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Tidal&lt;/a&gt; and still has Jack Dorsey as its CEO, the leadership pages now feature each person’s portrait projected onto cubes. Now, Twitter user @tarngerine has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tarngerine/status/1466288061034156033?s=20"&gt;pushed this developing meme even further&lt;/a&gt; by creating &lt;a href="https://blockify-xyz.glitch.me"&gt;a tool that lets you create your own blockhead image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vQ6ny"&gt;Using Blockify Yourself is pretty simple — you select an uncomfortably close-up image of your face (or any image, I suppose, but if you’re looking for the best results...), and the site will turn it into a cube. You can also mess around with the colors used to tint each side if you want to make the nightmare look &lt;em&gt;juuuust&lt;/em&gt; right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1e3ZwzGm_tBH4lqIjYqlJ33xNxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23058457/Screen_Shot_2021_12_02_at_10.06.23.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... the real thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mKYJB3"&gt;When you’re done with your cubist masterpiece, you can use the Save button to get it as a PNG. (Cubism is the one where artists just stick random images on cubes, right? I’m pretty sure that’s right.) I’m not sure there’s anything responsible you can do with that file except stare at it in despair, wondering what you’ve wrought upon the world. Oh, who am I kidding — just make it your Twitter profile picture, and change your display name to some geometry-shaped pun. People will wonder what the heck you’re doing, and you may catch a block or two, but it’ll be funny for those who get it. Or just use it to make hilarious jokes. Either way, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blocks/status/1466467520337137668"&gt;Block itself seems into it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zq0sez"&gt;Oh, and PS — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004?s=20"&gt;Square tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the name Block is partially inspired by blockchains (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617551/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-unite-country-world-peace-cryptocurrency"&gt;something Jack Dorsey is a fan of&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761305/tungsten-cube-meme-nft-crypto-midwest"&gt;the tungsten cubes&lt;/a&gt; that became a fad amongst crypto fans.

    <title>Polestar teases its upcoming electric SUV, the Polestar 3, set for release in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G856A_H0duzv31xp_yKELA_whMs=/0x359:8609x6098/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220297/642080_20211202_Polestar_3_preview.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2uxtII"&gt;Polestar offered a glimpse of its upcoming electric SUV, the Polestar 3, which will be the Volvo performance sub-brand’s first car manufactured in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq86OV"&gt;The SUV, which is expected to roll out in 2022, will slot into the premium category, putting it in competition with EVs like the Tesla Model X, Audi E-tron, Mercedes-Benz EQC, Rivian R1S, and Fisker Ocean. Notably, the Polestar will be assembled at Volvo’s factory in Charleston, South Carolina, giving it the distinction of being the company’s first EV made on US soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cQq65X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will build in America for Americans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDqmnZ"&gt;“We will build in America for Americans,” says Thomas Ingenlath, Polestar CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlTAoG"&gt;In addition to be being a higher-riding vehicle than the Polestar 2 fastback sedan, the Polestar 3 will also include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;partially autonomous driving system for highway driving&lt;/a&gt;. That will be thanks to the inclusion of a lidar sensor from supplier Luminar, which is also providing components for hands-free highway driving to Volvo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWmqRv"&gt;Volvo has said that it will roll out Highway Pilot as part of its next big platform update, the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA2), which will arrive with the next-generation XC90 SUV and Polestar 3 in 2022. SPA2 will also underpin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917697/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-ev-photos-hands-on"&gt;the XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hr9wRb"&gt;Polestar, which started out as the performance sub-brand of Volvo, has emerged as one of the more interesting EV companies on the market in recent years. The company, which is jointly owned by Volvo and Volvo’s parent company, Geely, recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;plans to go public&lt;/a&gt; by merging with a special acquisition company, or SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmnv0c"&gt;Polestar has only released two vehicles so far: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487290/polestar-volvo-hybrid-electric-revealed"&gt;the $155,000 hybrid coupe Polestar 1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;all-electric fastback sedan Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;. That lineup will grow with the release of the Polestar 3 SUV in 2022, the Polestar 4 compact SUV in 2023, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798880/polestar-5-precept-electric-sedan-tease-2024"&gt;the Polestar 5 (née Precept) sports sedan&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nymueh"&gt;We still don’t have the relevant specs for the Polestar 3, including price, battery size, range, and motor configuration. For what it’s worth, the Polestar 2 sports a 78kWh battery pack, which enables 291 miles (470 kilometers) of range. The electric motor puts off 408 horsepower, allowing for a 0–60 time in under five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xs6mq"&gt;The vehicle was teased during a Manhattan event updating investors on Polestar’s three-year business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luna Display’s latest update lets you use a Mac as a second PC display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tHW-4QDGPEPP7WfRVz5Eqpcagag=/266x0:2234x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70220047/5c_MattRonge_Astropad_r1_MSP29856_e1637257561528.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7WibN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://astropad.com/luna-display-5-1/"&gt;Luna Display’s latest update&lt;/a&gt; adds a helpful new feature: allowing you to hook up a Windows PC to a Mac laptop or desktop (including Apple’s flash M1 iMacs) to use as a secondary display. The new update also enables 4K and 5K resolution options (assuming you’ve got a screen that supports it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJiyw8"&gt;While Luna Display has offered Mac-to-Mac connectivity for a while, until now, users were only able to connect PCs to iPads using the company’s dongle and software setup. The new PC-to-Mac connection works both wirelessly and through an ethernet connection, just like the Mac-to-Mac option does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vnSmBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Luna Display can now turn your iPad into a second screen for Windows devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724866/luna-display-windows-support-ipad-second-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jsAbyZ"&gt;Additionally, Luna Display’s update adds support for 5K and 4K monitors at full resolutions, although there are still some limitations there: PCs can only run 5K at 30Hz, while Macs can run it at up to 45Hz, assuming they’ve been updated to macOS Big Sur. On the other hand, 4K resolution will run at up to 60Hz on both platforms. Still, combined with the new PC support, Luna Display’s update makes it a nearly perfect solution for using an M1 iMac as a secondary display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9FIlU"&gt;The new update comes hot on the heels of Luna Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724866/luna-display-windows-support-ipad-second-screen"&gt;adding support for PC-to-iPad&lt;/a&gt; setups earlier this year. Luna Display itself costs $129 for Mac or PC, with USB-C, HDMI, or Mini DisplayPort dongle options available depending on your platform of choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5lh6u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s frontline employees are struggling to survive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TMakkNSkUDwmBNK1rWcmPwojpeM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70219807/VRG_Illo_4894_Apple_Lede_Still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Jesse Zhang&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNHiPm"&gt;If you ask Jimmy Bailey what killed his best friend Mark Calivas, his answer is simple: “It was Apple.” How else could he explain how the Apple Store wellness champion — known for evangelizing therapy and mental health — would slide into a depression so profound he’d be forced to take medical leave and ultimately die by suicide? “It was nothing in his outside life that did this,” Bailey says. “It was work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEf0VL"&gt;Calivas started at the Apple Southpoint store in Durham, North Carolina in March 2013. His colleagues laughed when he’d arrived in the morning with multiple changes of clothes (he went on a six-mile run up the American Tobacco Trail on his lunch break) and healthy snacks (he was on the keto diet and carried around two 64oz water bottles). “He always had so many bags,” Bailey remembers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgrzDm"&gt;Calivas had his demons. His mother had died when he was young; he’d never really known his father. But his job at the Apple Store grounded him. It gave him a sense of dignity and purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dFP6sc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B0tvm5"&gt;Then the store hired a new manager: a whip smart, data-driven woman. According to Bailey and another former colleague, if you were on her good side, you could get a good schedule, a special project, a promotion. But if you weren’t? “You’d be punished in the most strategic ways possible,” the former colleague says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05UAOy"&gt;By all accounts, Mark Calivas was never on her good side. “She hated him, she told me,” the former colleague explains. “She just would constantly talk about how Mark wasn’t good enough, Mark wasn’t special, don’t give that opportunity to Mark because he hasn’t earned it, even though he had done everything to earn it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCaMbx"&gt;Over the years working under the manager, Calivas’ confidence started to wane. He felt trapped — intimidated and bullied by her behavior, according to his close friends. In 2021, he took medical leave to cope with his depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="c-entry-sidebar"&gt;
  &lt;p id="ycdM7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you or anyone you know is considering suicide or is anxious, depressed, upset, or needs to talk, there are people who want to help:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fBYtjM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5M6EQx"&gt;Bailey and two former colleagues say there have been multiple HR complaints filed against the manager (Apple would not confirm the complaints). But nothing ever seemed to change. “I filed three, maybe four complaints myself,” one of the former colleagues says. “I participated in at least six investigations.” Eventually, employees lost hope that anyone at Apple’s corporate office would hold the woman accountable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY5mhT"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy said: “We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CasmPp"&gt;The story illustrates a potentially widespread problem for Apple’s frontline workers. When something goes wrong — a bad manager, a missed paycheck, an untenable onslaught of work — many say they have no one to turn to for help. “Corporate makes decisions based on what they think will work in the stores without talking to people who work in the stores,” a former colleague says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zl4IJu"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eu7YEm"&gt;This struggle echoes a complaint made by some employees in Cupertino, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;who’ve said that the employee relations team&lt;/a&gt; — Apple’s version of human resources — is more concerned with protecting the company than its workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjANSH"&gt;But hourly workers at Apple may have it even worse. The employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;say that while the company is hyper concerned with customers, it treats its retail and customer service staff as an afterthought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3Zfdw"&gt;Over the past five months, Apple’s hourly workforce has been watching as corporate employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;advocate for more pay transparency&lt;/a&gt;. Some have organized with employees in Cupertino &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;under the banner #AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;, to call for better working conditions. Others are just now beginning to speak out — realizing that the issues their well-compensated corporate colleagues are experiencing could be greatly exacerbated on the frontlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRCZOp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with 16 current and former employees on Apple’s retail, support, and sales teams who say their complaints about working conditions and pay have largely been ignored. Some say they are governed more by algorithms and systems than actual managers, making it difficult to get holistic help. All of them note that while they came into the job believing in Apple’s mission, they see a profound breakdown in how the company’s corporate values translate to the frontlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQAEDv"&gt;“They say our soul is our people but it really didn’t feel like that to me,” a former employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mJPZZvn5ndQjxrwxIxtRC7BikAk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23049950/VRG_Illo_4894_Apple_Spot_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustrations by Jesse Zhang&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="kkef4x"&gt;Nearly every shift at an Apple Store starts the same way: an employee picks a line from the Apple credo and talks about how it applies to that day’s work: “We are here to enrich lives. To help dreamers become doers, to help passion expand human potential, to do the best work of our lives. At our best, we give more than we take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtfhTA"&gt;Workers say it’s easy to tell who wants to get promoted because they’ll pick the line “Turning dreamers into doers” and discuss how Apple’s devices can help customers do that. Not every retail worker buys into it, though. “People get emotional,” says a current retail employee in Philadelphia. “You see people go really deep in that stuff when they want to get promoted. It’s all just pandering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFKkVX"&gt;Part of the issue is pay. Apple’s retail employees make on average between $19 and $25 an hour in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Apple-Hourly-Pay-E1138.htm"&gt;according to Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt;. That’s good for the retail industry, but can be grating for employees who want to build a career at the tech giant. Some say that after staying at the company for six years, they’re making less than $21 an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HZ7vQ"&gt;Then there’s the issue of how retail workers are evaluated. In the store, Apple uses something called a “net promoter score” to see how stores are performing. After a customer leaves, they’ll sometimes receive a survey asking them to evaluate the employee who helped them as well as the overall store experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C4kFwa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees spent eight hours a day fielding inquiries from angry customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ljeqNJ"&gt;Low scores can often be about factors outside the employees’ control — things like low inventory or wait time. But they still reflect poorly on staff. “There’s never positive intent assumed,” says a current employee in Pittsburgh. “It always feels like you’re a kid getting in trouble and you’re making an excuse.” The surveys are meant to give customers a consistent way to say whether the stores are meeting Apple’s standards — but they systematically place the customer over the employee, by design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4FU1"&gt;This can be particularly frustrating when the issue stems from Apple corporate. In 2017, Apple customers with older iPhones realized that if they replaced their phone batteries, the performance would significantly improve. This quickly became one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology"&gt;Apple’s largest customer experience scandals&lt;/a&gt;, as people realized the company had intentionally slowed down older iPhone models to (supposedly) preserve their battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCeK0z"&gt;To quell public outrage, the company said it would replace phone batteries, free of charge, for a year. To meet rising customer demand, Apple told some retail workers to try to complete battery swaps in under 10 minutes, according to a former employee. The result was a disaster for workers, who say they didn’t have the supplies or resources necessary to meet the mandate. “You can’t replace a battery in 10 minutes,” a former retail manager says bluntly. “Nothing translates from corporate to the stores because they’re not in the stores.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwaHmR"&gt;Set against this backdrop, the Apple credo has become increasingly important. It’s meant to inspire employees to provide exemplary customer service — to elevate even mundane parts of the job to stratospheric levels of importance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJa16b"&gt;In the past, some employees assumed that it applied to how Apple treated its workforce. Wasn’t the company supposed to enrich the lives of its employees? To give more than it took?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9VQyvX"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FToUXM"&gt;That started to break down on March 14th, 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, when Apple announced it was temporarily closing all its stores, sending retail employees home. In Pennsylvania, one current worker was selected to be part of a new program to answer calls from customers who needed tech support over the phone. The employee was relieved — his wife was immunocompromised, and he himself suffered from asthma, making the pair particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Being able to work from home seemed like a perfect solution to stay safe and continue earning money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ybNdj"&gt;From the start, the job was stressful. Employees spent eight hours a day fielding inquiries from angry customers. They were evaluated based on call time and customer satisfaction. As with many hourly roles at Apple, people with high scores knew they’d eventually get better schedules, promotions, and opportunities. People with low scores could be placed on action plans to try to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiBQkL"&gt;The Pennsylvania employee says he didn’t hear much from his manager until July 2020, when he was told that his scores were good. So good, in fact, that he was going to start taking tier two calls. If a lower-level adviser couldn’t answer a customer’s questions, they could escalate the call to him. He asked if the job came with a pay bump and was told it did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkD2aX"&gt;Apple tried to make up for the increased workload for hourly employees by sending employees in the work from home program a shirt as a gift for all their hard work. When it arrived, employees realized it had a large 14 on the back (for iOS 14) and 2020 printed on the sleeve. These were leftovers from WWDC 2020 — Apple’s live event that had been canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGWyPI"&gt;The shirt felt like a slap in the face. Employees wanted a raise. Some had multiple roommates and worked two or three jobs to try to make ends meet. On top of that, they were dealing with the same existential angst as the rest of the population weathering a global pandemic — all while being yelled at on the phone by customers who barely treated them like people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tV4WZc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It starts to get into a game of fixing the numbers more than helping the customers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wzI63A"&gt;The Pennsylvania employee said his mental health started to suffer. He was working in a poorly lit room, unable to leave the house because of the lockdown. When he tried to talk to his manager about how he was feeling, he was told to try opening a window or put a plant on his desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJI1Zm"&gt;One day, the employee was doing a screen share with a customer who was having issues with her display. The device wasn’t under warranty — he told her it would likely cost $500 to fix. The woman started to cry. “I’m a college student, can’t you make an exception?” she asked. He said he was sorry, but it wasn’t up to him. Then the woman opened Photo Booth on her computer screen — activating the webcam — and held a razor to her wrist. “This is what the stress you’re giving me is doing to me,” he says she told him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v97QKf"&gt;When the employee explained to his boss what had happened, the man asked if he needed half an hour to decompress. The employee responded that it didn’t feel like enough time. According to his recollection, his boss conceded: “Okay, take a breather, but try to keep it to 30 minutes because we need to keep our call time down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpWZIg"&gt;In early 2021, Apple Stores started to reopen, and the employee asked to go back to in-person work. “I have asthma, my wife has a chronic illness, but we were forced to wager my mental health against my physical health to see if it was worth going back to the store,” he says. The decision wasn’t his anyway — he was told he needed to keep working from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ8MoG"&gt;It wasn’t until he asked to go on medical leave that he was finally able to go back to the store. “They let me come back to the store to keep me off leave,” he alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8ABJz"&gt;In September, Apple announced that all retail and care employees who’d been with the company since March 31st would receive a $1,000 bonus. To some workers, it was a nice surprise; but after years of feeling mistreated, others believe the bonus had more sinister motivations. “I think it feels more like they don’t want to get sued for not offering hazard pay after making some of us work in public in the last year,” the Pennsylvania employee says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="0xeMLe"&gt;The mental health strain that retail employees felt working from home during the pandemic gave them a glimpse into the lives of another organization at the tech giant: AppleCare. These employees are part of the company’s tech support team that answers customer questions in online chats and over the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Bv6pE"&gt;One employee, a gay man living in the South, said that when he landed a job at Apple after high school, he knew he’d stay with the company for years. “This big company that everyone talks about, I had a chance to be a part of,” he says. “I always describe it as my longest relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsK8Gu"&gt;At first, the idea of working from home for a tech giant seemed too good to be true. But over time, he says sitting at a computer for eight to 10 hours a day started to take a mental toll. In 2021, he decided to take medical leave to cope with the stress of responding to customers in under two minutes, a requirement for his position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPeSAC"&gt;As his medical bills started piling up, the employee says he and his partner ran out of money. “We had to start selling our belongings to pay bills,” he explains. “We downsized and spent most of the summer without electricity or air conditioning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAixJV"&gt;When his paycheck arrived in May 2021, he found it was just $23, due to health insurance deductions. He couldn’t afford to pay rent. When he contacted Apple’s corporate payroll team, he said the response was, “We’ll look into it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1fcM23"&gt;&lt;section class="ad"&gt;
    &lt;div class="ad__inner"&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXxUn1"&gt;“I’ve given the best years of my life, all my 20s working for Apple, now I need help and they’re not there,” the employee says. “I don’t think the corporate people or payroll teams have any idea what it’s like to live on the edge financially,” the employee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ7H0H"&gt;While Apple’s corporate offices take a proactive, deliberate approach to product development, Apple’s customer support function operates in a reactive mania, using a vast array of processes and metrics to keep employees on task. If workers go to the bathroom or are away from their computers for more than five minutes, they’ll sometimes get a note from their manager asking why they aren’t working. They’re monitored based on their customer satisfaction score, as well as after call work time, which dictates how much time after a call or chat they spend writing up notes, and average handle time (AHT), which indicates how long it takes them to solve a customer issue. A good AHT is around 15 minutes for phone calls and about two minutes for chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKkOyY"&gt;“It starts to get into a game of fixing the numbers more than helping the customers. They look at the numbers and assume that is helping the customer,” a former employee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fd90iL"&gt;Employees who really want to help customers say they often have to sacrifice their personal metrics. “If I have an elderly person on the phone, am I going to be a little slower with them to the detriment of my personal metrics?” a current employee asks. “Yes, I can’t treat every person the same because they’re not all the same.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXfBC8"&gt;On chats, the ability to resolve issues can be even more difficult, as employees are expected to speak to three people simultaneously during busy parts of the year. “It’s impossible to do a good job multitasking with that many scenarios,” a current employee explains. “Especially because we have to respond in two minutes — from an Apple ID issue to an iCloud issue to an iOS [or] Mac install.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YhB1ke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A month has passed and I still see him in that chair whether my eyes are closed or open.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JaUc16"&gt;About four years ago, Apple started hiring vendors to manage some of the chats and calls. For tier two advisers — people who were tasked with taking calls that couldn’t be resolved by lower-level employees — this meant a sudden onslaught of angry customers. Vendors didn’t receive the same level of training as in-house Apple employees, according to multiple employees, meaning issues were constantly being escalated. By the time a tier two adviser got the call, customers were often irate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmFliU"&gt;In September 2019, an AppleCare employee wrote a letter to management laying out the team’s grievances. The letter said the company should “eradicate triple chats and reduce double chats” and noted “Apple should include a cost of living adjustment in addition to our raises, because it’s fair and just.” They included links to studies about how multitasking increases chronic stress. (The employee declined an interview request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWRzeH"&gt;Then, in February 2021, tier two chat advisers were told those jobs were being eliminated. One employee says they were told that it was because customer satisfaction ratings weren’t as high for the tier two chat team as they were for the tier two phone advisers. “It was a self-fulfilling prophecy,” the employee explains, noting that taking three chats at a time is notably different than answering one phone call after another. “We equated it to being able to do your job with one hand tied behind your back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDEbs6"&gt;Employees felt like the promise of working at Apple — the idea that you could move up in the organization and eventually land a managerial role — was slowly being taken away. In the past, hardworking employees could be selected for a “team manager assistant” role — meaning they’d fill in for managers who were on vacation. The idea was that eventually they themselves would become the manager. In practice, however, it just meant that they took on managerial responsibilities, with the illusion of possible job progression, and received no extra pay. Now, even that thin reward felt elusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZk8lv"&gt;Employees also saw a disparity in Apple’s financial success — reflected in the wealth of its executives — and their own financial pricarity. In 2015, Tim Cook announced that he planned to give away his $800 million fortune before he died. “When I saw Tim Cook was saying he’s worth nearly a billion dollars and he plans to give all of that away before he dies, I thought, ‘Well shit, he could start with us in AppleCare,’” a current employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bqNaGO"&gt;
&lt;p id="ygS6iz"&gt;A few weeks before he died, Mark Calivas sent an email to an Apple human resources representative, according to a text conversation he later had with his friend Jimmy Bailey, excerpts of which have been viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Over seven years, I too have been a victim of intimidation, public humiliation, bullying, slandering, retaliation, and on one occasion, lies,” he wrote. “I have held out a long time for change, but to date, no Store Leader or Senior Manager has been able to keep me safe from [the manager]. I want to return to work for Apple. I want to keep contributing to the company. However, for my mental health, I don’t feel like I can do so while working in the same environment as [the manager].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qL3l8C"&gt;Bailey says Calivas had lost hope that he’d be able to transfer to a different store. After all the investigations into the manager had gone nowhere, he felt — like some other employees at the store — that corporate just didn’t care. Unlike his three former colleagues, however, he was now too depressed to interview for another job and leave Apple altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lC2foe"&gt;The morning of September 7th, 2021, Bailey walked into Calivas’ room to find him slumped over a chair, his arms hanging limp in his lap. He was wearing a bright yellow hazmat hood. A tube ran from the hood to a silver tank with a green painted top. The face of the hood was clear, and covered with condensation. “A month has passed and I still see him in that chair whether my eyes are closed or open,” Bailey says. Calivas had died from inhaling nitrogen, according to the coroner’s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVVRv0"&gt;“I want to end this speaking directly to Tim Cook,” Bailey says in a final interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Tim, I have emailed you about this issue. I explained the damage caused at Apple Southpoint. I spoke to an employee relations representative and expressed my concern. I told him that all they need to do is look into the records on hand to see the devastation that could have been prevented. What then, Tim, do you plan on doing? I still see Mark. I see him constantly. But even though I see him, he is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWiKEg"&gt;In a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Apple spokesperson said: “We were devastated by the death of our colleague and our thoughts are with his loved ones in their time of grief.”&lt;/p&gt;
