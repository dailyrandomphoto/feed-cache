    <title>LiveLeak, the internet’s font of gore and violence, has shut down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kPGITICrqoWSnoREK099Ws4hvyc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250956/acastro_200915_1777_hacking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vYX0TS"&gt;Video site LiveLeak, best known for hosting gruesome footage that mainstream rivals wouldn’t touch, has &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/ll"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; after fifteen years in operation. In its place is “ItemFix,” a site that &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/faq"&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; users from uploading media containing “excessive violence or gory content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y0JhE"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.itemfix.com/ll"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, LiveLeak founder Hayden Hewitt did not give an explicit reason for the site’s closure, saying only that: “The world has changed a lot over these last few years, the Internet alongside it, and we as people.” In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/b7iNvp82OTo"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted on his YouTube channel Trigger Warning, Hewitt offered no further details, but said that maintaining LiveLeak had become a struggle, and that he and his team “just didn’t have it in us to carry on fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG42SS"&gt;“Everything’s different now, everything moves on,” says Hewitt, before adding in an aside to the camera: “I don’t fucking like it. I liked it much better when it was the Wild West.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pkYmI7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LiveLeak grew out of the “shock sites” of the early internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5LwNE"&gt;LiveLeak has been a mainstay of internet culture for many years, its name synonymous with footage of murder, terrorism, and everyday incidents of crime and violence. A sinister doppelgänger to sites like YouTube, LiveLeak was founded in 2006 and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316104436/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/profile-of-hayden-hewitt-founder-of-liveleak-2014-10"&gt;grew out of a culture &lt;/a&gt;of early internet “shock sites” like Ogrish, &lt;a href="http://Rotten.com"&gt;Rotten.com&lt;/a&gt;, and BestGore: websites that hosted violent and pornographic content with the express aim of disgusting visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBS4q5"&gt;LiveLeak, with its tagline of “Redefining the Media,” ostensibly added some nuance to this brutish appeal. Official statements from those involved sometimes defended its content in terms of newsworthiness or truth-telling. When the site attracted controversy in the UK for hosting footage of children fighting, for example, Hewitt defended sharing the videos as a form of bearing witness.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;We have to take a stance of saying ‘look all this is happening, this is real life, this is going on, we’re going to show it,’” he told &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6920817.stm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3oEHq"&gt;Despite this, the site often changed its policies concerning controversial footage. In 2014 it attracted significant attention (and traffic) for hosting a video of the beheading of US journalist James Foley by terror group ISIS. But soon after the site’s owners &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111225012/https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a69_1408615973"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would host no future beheading videos created by ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGGMQU"&gt;“We’ve shown the world the true horror of this form of execution more than once in the past and we cannot find any compelling reason to even be thought of as promoting the actions of this group,” said a blog post. “We know they [ISIS] do not find support here on LL and that condemnation is virtually universal but there is no reason at all to show more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJUIC4"&gt;Similarly, the site chose not to host videos of the 2019 Christchurch shootings, stating in another &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hnKeuRG4z8YJ:https://www.liveleak.com/view%3Ft%3DuSQT_1552831454+&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that LiveLeak never had a “show everything” policy, and that hosting the video would only give the shooter what he wanted: more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aboy7j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LiveLeak attracted sizable traffic, proof of the enduring appeal of its shocking content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVX7qt"&gt;Although the site’s content likely stopped it from reaching the prominence of other video hosts, it still attracted sizable numbers of viewers. A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/style/really-bad-stuff.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that web tracking firm Alexa ranked it as the 695th most popular website in the world, putting it roughly on a par with mainstream sites like &lt;em&gt;The Onion &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Jezebel&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaBF1T"&gt;The same report cites an academic &lt;a href="https://people.southwestern.edu/~bednarb/capstone/capstone_materials/payton_reading.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Sue Tait that attempts to explain the enduring popularity of such violent and gory content. Based on her observations of the Ogrish forums, Tait categorized four different “spectatorial positions.” There is the “amoral gaze,” where the content is stimulating and pleasurable; the “vulnerable gaze” where the imagery is experienced as harmful; the “entitled gaze,” where viewers justify their actions as seeing past the “censorship” of mainstream outlets; and the “responsive gaze,” where looking is framed as a way for the viewer to prepare for coming hardships, like a career in the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IEGu5"&gt;The range of justifications identified by Tait and other academics suggest that demand for such extreme content will always exist, even if individual sites like LiveLeak come and go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0HCSJ"&gt;In his farewell blog post, the site’s founder Hayden Hewitt emphasized the importance of the site’s community. “To the members, the uploaders, the casual visitors, the trolls and the occasionally demented people who have been with us. You have been our constant companions and although we probably didn’t get to communicate too often you’re appreciated more than you realize,” he writes. “On a personal level you have fascinated and amused me with your content. Lastly, to those no longer with us. I still remember you.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC report blasts manufacturers for restricting product repairs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/STLdVDwAAMcAN305IgVlBOTlR98=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250741/apple_repair_service_expansion_iphone_repair_07072020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4Mi4o"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/05/ftc-report-congress-examines-anti-competitive-repair-restrictions"&gt;published its long-awaited report&lt;/a&gt; on how manufacturers limit product repairs. The &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf"&gt;“Nixing the Fix” report&lt;/a&gt; details a host of repair restrictions, especially those imposed by mobile phone and car manufacturers. The anticompetitive practices covered by the FTC range from limited availability of spare parts and diagnostic software to designs that make repairs more difficult than they need to be. In response, the FTC wants to develop new laws and rules surrounding repairs, but it also wants better enforcement of existing legislation like the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfRirC"&gt;While debates around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;right to repair rules in the EU&lt;/a&gt; have tended to focus on the environmental impact of sending broken devices to landfills, the FTC’s report leads with the impacts they have on people. It says repair restrictions are bad for consumers when they can’t easily repair their devices, and adds that these “may place a greater financial burden on communities of color and lower-income Americans.” Independent repair shops also suffer as a result of repair restrictions, “disproportionately [affecting] small businesses owned by people of color.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRPHOd"&gt;The timing of the report is also important. Not only has it arrived during an unprecedented period of working from home and remote learning, where teleworking equipment is more important than ever, but it also coincides with a global semiconductor shortage that’s made buying new equipment particularly difficult. Combined, they make it particularly important to be able to repair our existing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYTYKl"&gt;According to the FTC, manufacturers are guilty of using numerous tactics that make it difficult for customers and independent businesses to repair their products. Here’s the full list from the FTC’s report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2axQtK"&gt;Product designs that complicate or prevent repair;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ckz8W1"&gt;Unavailability of parts and repair information;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKIyh2"&gt;Designs that make independent repairs less safe;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzOvyB"&gt;Policies or statements that steer consumers to manufacturer repair networks;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoIGYg"&gt;Application of patent rights and enforcement of trademarks;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks3br4"&gt;Disparagement of non-OEM parts and independent repair;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6a7q89"&gt;Software locks and firmware updates; or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu9KKy"&gt;End User License Agreements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LdeBZZ"&gt;Manufacturers have long argued that they have legitimate reasons for at least some of these restrictions. These include protecting their intellectual property, cybersecurity, and possible safety risks associated with independent repairers opening up our devices and replacing failed parts. But the FTC isn’t buying it. “There is scant evidence to support manufacturers’ justifications for repair restrictions,” the report states, adding that “the majority” of manufacturers’ explanations for repair restrictions “are not supported by the record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfAwbs"&gt;Apple, one of the companies most frequently criticized for its repair policies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357187/apple-independent-repair-program-in-over-200-countries"&gt;has made moves&lt;/a&gt; to make spare parts and diagnostic tools more available to independent repair shops in recent years. But &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdjnv/apples-independent-repair-program-is-invasive-to-shops-and-their-customers-contract-shows"&gt;critics say&lt;/a&gt; the new policies still give the company too much power over independent businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erY1ot"&gt;The CEO of repair specialists iFixit &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F50251%2Fftc-report-congress-nixing-fix-repair-restrictions-reactions&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424363%2Fftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;welcomed the FTC’s report&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a great step in the right direction,” said Kyle Wiens. “The bi-partisan report shows that FTC knows that the market has not regulated itself, and is committing to real action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4632vN"&gt;With the findings submitted to Congress, the question now is how to make repairing devices easier. The FTC’s report makes several suggestions, including the introduction of new legislation to address repair restrictions and open repair markets. While it also encourages manufacturers to self-regulate, the FTC concedes that the broad range of industries and products involved would make that a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agyY7y"&gt;The FTC suggests consumers could be given more information on how repairable devices are, such as with repairability scores like those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302664/apple-france-repairability-scores-index-law-right-to-repair"&gt;recently introduced in France&lt;/a&gt;. But the FTC also wants consumers to report when manufacturers aren’t obeying existing rules surrounding repairs, as described in an &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/ftc-weighs-repair-restrictions"&gt;accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TasIEE"&gt;Let’s say you took a product to an independent repair shop to fix or maintain it. Then later you go to the product’s manufacturer for a repair — but one not related to the earlier fix. If that repair is covered by your warranty, and if your warranty hasn’t expired, the manufacturer can’t refuse to make the repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhkxzb"&gt;If you’re told that your warranty was voided or that it will be voided because of independent repair, we want to hear about it. Report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P5clzb"&gt;The FTC’s report follows efforts by several US states, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719701/european-parliament-right-to-repair-resolution-hardware-eu-commission-2021"&gt;European Parliament vote last year&lt;/a&gt;, to expand right to repair rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sennheiser’s headphone business has been bought by hearing aid manufacturer Sonova</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="sennheiser hd 800 s" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huoegl7CXkptC4XuEU0qyTQ4Nd4=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69250731/sennheiser_hd_800_s.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pair of Sennheiser HD 800 S headphones. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZZolL1"&gt;Sonova, a Swiss company best known for its medical audio products like hearing aids and cochlear implants, is &lt;a href="https://www.sonova.com/en/expanding-our-offering-and-entering-new-growth-markets-sonova-acquire-sennheiser-consumer-division"&gt;buying&lt;/a&gt; the consumer electronics division of German firm Sennheiser. That means Sonova is taking over Sennheiser’s portfolio of consumer headphones, wireless earbuds, and soundbars, moving into an expanding market for personal audio equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOdZ6V"&gt;Sennheiser announced it was looking for a buyer for its consumer business in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285497/sennheiser-investors-selling-consumer-headphones-soundbars-business"&gt;mid-February&lt;/a&gt; “amid strong competitive pressure.” Although the company’s consumer products hit record sales in 2019, the firm still lost money with profit margins “under pressure” from global rivals. It cut 650 jobs and said “all options are open” to help the division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPeBiw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sennheiser’s brand (and products) will live on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nB4I2X"&gt;Now the company has found a buyer in Sonova. In a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fmessage-from-andreas-and-daniel-sennheiser-otoics&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424367%2Fsonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; by Sennheiser’s co-CEOs, brothers Andreas and Daniel Sennheiser, the pair said they “couldn’t have asked for [a] better” partner. “A partner who not only shares our passion for audio and a commitment to the highest product quality, but also very similar corporate values,” they write. “This is an excellent foundation for a successful future together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlURCi"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen-us.sennheiser.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fsonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-wpc768&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F7%2F22424367%2Fsonova-buys-sennheiser-consumer-business-headphones-soundbars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the deal from Sonova, the company said it will continue to sell products under the Sennheiser brand. “Combining our audiological expertise with Sennheiser’s know-how in sound delivery, their great reputation as well as their high-quality products will allow us to expand our offering and to create important touchpoints with consumers earlier in their hearing journey,” said Sonova CEO Arnd Kaldowski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwEHAA"&gt;Sonova said the purchase price of the division amounts to €200 million ($241 million), and that Sennheiser’s business generates revenues of €250 million annually. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, but Sonova says it expects to close it in “the second half of calendar year 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRs8f3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic needs to tarnish Apple’s App Store halo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_dbuH7j00UhHKuAGNbEG0UMwpE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249704/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3Yc8Y"&gt;At the beginning of this week’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, Apple described Epic’s lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad’s defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic’s own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qes3P"&gt;Epic spent the fourth day of trial offering its counter-narrative: the iOS App Store isn’t actually very good. Calling two Apple executives to the stand, Epic’s attorneys took jabs at everything from the update review process to Apple allegedly leaking Marshmello’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concert playlist. They pushed Apple to justify its claims about privacy and security by producing hard research demonstrating threats and breaches — which Apple largely didn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JAdN3U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic is making the case that the app store just isn’t very good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOrmnw"&gt;After a short examination of Epic’s online business strategy head Thomas Ko, Epic called on Matt Fischer, App Store vice president and the first witness employee from Apple. Epic’s attorney peppered Fischer with anecdotes from frustrated developers — calling the iOS in-app payment system a “joke,” the refund policies “awful,” the review process “arbitrary and unpredictable,” and the entire store “plagued with outdated, low-quality apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spju9Q"&gt;Apple’s App Store has some clear problems. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;my colleague Sean Hollister wrote last month&lt;/a&gt;, you can find ridiculous stories about iOS apps that appear to swindle users yet maintain unbelievably high review stories — and aren’t removed even months after a formal complaint. Eric Friedman, an Apple employee who is set to testify, has been quoted saying the app review team is “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog” or “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gun fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qssmJ"&gt;But Epic’s questioning today didn’t capture the kind of drama that implies. The attorneys spent much of their time trying to catch Apple executives in contradictions, and while they quoted disgruntled developers like the ones above, they rarely delved into the substance of their complaints. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers became audibly irritated with Epic repeatedly producing documents to establish a “state of mind” about the App Store rather than hard facts, since the files would be uploaded for public viewing. “Non-lawyers don’t understand the difference between something being admitted for its truth and being admitted for some other evidentiary purpose,” she told an attorney. Apple countered one negative review snippet simply by having Fischer read the line above it, where the writer said they were still giving the App Store a high rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzD79T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qj6Fko"&gt;There’s one plausible reason Epic doesn’t have more specific stories: many developers are &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html"&gt;reportedly scared to criticize Apple&lt;/a&gt;. That’s been a running theme in congressional scrutiny of Apple, and Epic has vividly established the consequences of getting banished from the App Store — even if developers try to return via Apple’s Safari browser, they’ll be denied access to things like push notifications and AR features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiaM2i"&gt;Epic also still has witnesses who could poke holes in Apple’s narrative. Friedman is scheduled to appear over the next two weeks, and so is an executive from Match Group, which spoke critically of Apple in front of Congress. Epic’s attorneys left a big question hanging about whether Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/"&gt;offers special terms to some developers&lt;/a&gt; — something Fischer denied, but wasn’t heavily pressed on. In any case, this trial hinges on much more than the precise quality of Apple’s developer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fP4keM"&gt;But today demonstrates the difficulty of discussing large-scale moderation without opening yourself up to charges of dealing in mere anecdotes. Judge Rogers made clear that she’s interested in whether Apple is better or worse than its alternatives, not simply whether it’s ever had problems. And while Epic can point to individual screwups, Apple will try to argue that it’s doing its best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvs9pg"&gt;“It’s a human process. We do make mistakes,” said Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, the day’s last witness. “But we certainly try to rectify those mistakes when we learn of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Don’t drive while you are on a Zoom meeting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VyYANj"&gt;Who among us has not tried during the pandemic to conceal the background of our home offices during a Zoom call for work— lest we reveal a messy bedroom, or get ragged on by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom"&gt;RoomRater&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDnJdr"&gt;For Republican state Sen. Andrew Brenner of Ohio, the green screen betrayed him during a video call this week, making it clear he was driving a car even though his background image &lt;a href="http://ohiochannel.org/video/ohio-controlling-board-5-3-2021"&gt;showed what looked like a home office&lt;/a&gt;. That wouldn’t have been a big deal except it was the same day that Ohio’s legislature was considering a bill that would have toughened the state’s rules on driving while using an electronic device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKgpfz"&gt;One could argue that a video call might be a significant distraction while driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NSA6o"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/05/03/ohio-state-sen-andrew-brenner-attended-government-meeting-via-video-while-driving/4929012001/"&gt;Brenner told the &lt;em&gt;Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he was parked for most of the video call, was not distracted, and was listening to the meeting. He also noted he was wearing his seat belt and paying attention to the road while he was driving. But as &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/politicians-zoom-background-cant-hide-fact-that-hes-act-1846835103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the video Brenner turns his camera on and off, and continually adjusts the background as if he’s not happy with how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mjifQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-283"&gt;Ohio House Bill 283&lt;/a&gt; would enhance the state law on distracted driving, “to a general prohibition against using an electronic wireless communications devices.” Hands-free and voice-operated devices would be allowed, and there’s an exception for emergencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqaCkE"&gt;At the very least, Brenner adhered to&lt;a href="https://publicsafety.ohio.gov/static/HSY7742.pdf"&gt; Ohio’s seat belt law&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe for the next meeting he should keep it in park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXUDrA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: An earlier version of this story stated that the Zoom meeting Brenner attended was where the distracted driving bill was discussed. In fact, the bill was being discussed the same day in the Ohio legislature. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FMbrl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ThpsP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihUjqx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1LEss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvVrKy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tJ7Ec"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4u7qE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a new Tip Jar feature for sending money to your favorite accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajljYICFX84AjiO6tkC0zcvnAvA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69248373/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1g4b2"&gt;Twitter has started &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html"&gt;rolling out a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt; on its Android and iOS apps, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;as rumored&lt;/a&gt;) will allow users to send money directly to their favorite accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WVUWS"&gt;To use the tip jar, simply tap on the freshly added dollar bill icon next to someone’s username when viewing their profile on one of Twitter’s mobile apps. Users will be able to toggle the tip jar feature, too (for those individuals or organizations that don’t want people just sending them cash out of the blue). Android users will also be able to send money in Twitter’s Clubhouse-like Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uWH8v"&gt;Tip Jar supports a variety of payment options and links: Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, Paypal, and Venmo. Twitter is using those services’ external payment processors for transactions; it doesn’t take a cut. All English language Twitter users can send tips starting today, but only a select group (including “creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits”) can turn on the feature to accept money for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3xme8z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;show your love, leave a tip &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;now testing Tip Jar, a new way to give and receive money on Twitter   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;more coming soon... &lt;a href="https://t.co/7vyCzlRIFc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7vyCzlRIFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter (@Twitter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1390396166496522247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cY25Va"&gt;Users have been using Twitter to solicit tips or Patreon follows for years — ending viral threads with a shoutout to a SoundCloud account is practically a meme at this point. So it makes sense that Twitter would be looking to streamline the feature as part of its own app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMinK6"&gt;Notably, the only way to access Tip Jar right now is through navigating to a user’s profile. That means sending someone some money for a truly fantastic tweet will still take a bit more effort than, say, just liking or retweeting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13beBE"&gt;There are already some issues that Twitter will have to work out. As spotted by Rachel Tobac, sending tips through Paypal using Tip Jar currently allows whoever is sending the money to see the recipient’s address, which is a worrying security issue that Twitter and Paypal will hopefully resolve soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p02t7P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Huge heads up on PayPal Twitter Tip Jar. If you send a person a tip using PayPal, when the receiver opens up the receipt from the tip you sent, they get your *address*. Just tested to confirm by tipping &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yashar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@yashar&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter w/ PayPal and he did in fact get my address I tipped him. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ"&gt;https://t.co/R4NvaXRdlZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/r8UyJpNCxu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/r8UyJpNCxu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rachel Tobac (@RachelTobac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1390409874006183936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3gRtp1"&gt;In an update later Thursday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1390451333602422787?s=20"&gt;Twitter’s Support account&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the issue, tweeting that it was “updating our tipping prompt and Help Center to make it clearer that other apps may share info between people sending/receiving tips, per their terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpclYz"&gt;Twitter also promised there was “more coming soon,” so it’s likely that we’ll continue to hear more about how Twitter is implementing tipping in the coming weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aetg0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 5:30pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information on Paypal address security issues using Tip Jar. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9OrdM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th 8:27PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional detail from Twitter about shared information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is giving a laser company that builds some of its AR tech $410 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aRyl5MrUP2oO6_aV2UEnNRwpXI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249312/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C0IJlY"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-awards-an-additional-410-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-ii-vi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F6%2F22423827%2Fapple-ii-vi-advanced-manufacturing-fund-award-ar-vr-faceid" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s awarding Pennsylvania-based optical technology company II-VI with $410 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple CEO  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1390378601690791938"&gt;Tim Cook tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s tech helps power Apple’s FaceID, Memoji, and Portrait Mode. The company also manufactures lasers that are used in the LIDAR scanner found in the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro, technology that Apple touts as being key to augmented reality experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGxtFF"&gt;Finisar, which was &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/09/finisar-acquisition-iivi-aapl-fnsr.html"&gt;later acquired by II-VI&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “two-six”) r&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771246/apple-finisar-iphone-laser-investment"&gt;eceived $390 million&lt;/a&gt; from Apple’s fund back in 2017. While this latest investment likely shows that Apple intends to keep FaceID (which is powered by II-VI’s vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers) around for a while, it could also be another sign pointing to Apple’s future with AR and VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3seH3"&gt;Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;has publicly said&lt;/a&gt; that he believes AR is “critically important” to Apple’s future, and II-VI manufactures devices that help computers see the world in 3D. The money could help develop more advanced version of the technology already found on Apple devices, potentially for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;the rumored mixed reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. II-VI’s CEO says in Apple’s press release that the partnership with Apple “sets the stage for a new wave of breakthrough technologies that we believe will enable a wide range of applications that will benefit our world for decades to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuvtMT"&gt;The press release states that II-VI will use the funds to expand manufacturing capacity, create jobs, and “accelerate delivery of future components for iPhone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHqVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article had II-VI written as II-IV throughout. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says it ‘could take months’ to bring treadmill back after recall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHoLVnpdhcp4VHzdU2y3xP9Ln-s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249172/akrales_190328_3240_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aWCTpt"&gt;Peloton expects it to be a number of months before either of its treadmills are offered for sale again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;after a recall was issued&lt;/a&gt; on both models yesterday. One of the models posed the risk of “injury or death,” Peloton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4mY00"&gt;The more expensive Tread Plus treadmill, which has been on sale since 2018, “could take months” to return to market, said Peloton CEO John Foley on a call with investors this afternoon. Peloton needs to develop a hardware solution to prevent people, animals, and objects from getting sucked underneath the machine and then get that solution approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). A six-year-old child died recently after being pulled underneath a Tread Plus, the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdiQF5"&gt;The cheaper machine, the Tread, could be up for sale again as soon as July, Foley said. He said the timeline for a fix to be approved could be six to eight weeks. Fixing the Tread will be simpler, he said, since it largely involves making a change to screws and washers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Dsi9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We expect them to be the best products by far in the market and the safest products.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="naNm7U"&gt;Peloton recalled both treadmill models yesterday due to concerns they could injure owners or others near them. The Tread Plus had the most serious problems, with more than 70 recorded incidents of adults, children, pets, or objects being pulled under the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuzOhd"&gt;The issues were less severe for the lower-cost Tread model. The CPSC said there were 18 incidents of the Tread’s touchscreen falling and causing minor cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada, where it’s primarily for sale. That model has only been sold in limited numbers in the US, but it was supposed to go on sale widely starting May 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NwT0c"&gt;Foley told investors the company’s treadmills would return with safety in mind, saying the company needed to be a “leader in safety in the industry.” He said the company’s repaired products would be “one of the safest if not the safest treadmills in the world” and that “when we bring them back to the market, we expect them to be the best products by far in the market and the safest products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQa9y5"&gt;Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"&gt;initially resisted&lt;/a&gt; the CPSC’s urge for a recall. In a note yesterday, Foley said that was a mistake. “We should have engaged more productively with [the CPSC] from the outset,” Foley wrote. “For that, I apologize.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google remembers Wear OS long enough to add a new keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/opKbAX3v7mKsxtcZh5-Mo4rKK64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69249052/awhite_20200305__3923_0239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aw45Wp"&gt;In what feels like an increasingly rare occurrence, Google announced that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/108870878/new-gboard-app-arrives-on-wear-os?hl=en"&gt;it’s updating Wear OS&lt;/a&gt; with a new feature today — but don’t get too excited, it’s just a keyboard. In this case, Google is porting over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/22/11287220/google-keyboard-iOS-search"&gt;Gboard&lt;/a&gt;, the swipeable, predictive text-powered keyboard that it offers for Android, iOS, and Android TV, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/wear-os-gboard/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEp0eW"&gt;Like the larger phone version, Gboard for Wear OS supports multiple input methods on a keyboard that’s slightly more finger-friendly than the old version the operating system used. You can type by tapping, swiping, or speaking. The keyboard also has easier access to emoji and “enhanced suggestions” above the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqsxVN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Message the way you want to with the new Gboard ⌨️ on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WearOSbyGoogle?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WearOSbyGoogle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Multiple ways to message like voice, QWERTY keyboard or gestures ✔️&lt;br&gt;Enhanced suggestions and corrections ✔️&lt;br&gt;Multi-language support ✔️&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See what’s new: &lt;a href="https://t.co/RjjtZO23Tv"&gt;https://t.co/RjjtZO23Tv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dggR6HxsFc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dggR6HxsFc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wear OS by Google (@WearOSbyGoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle/status/1390338114833588230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J0RhsX"&gt;Along with the new keyboard, Google says it’s also introducing multi-language support for all of the languages offered on Wear OS. To switch languages, Gboard for Wear OS has a language shortcut at the bottom of the keyboard that will pull up a menu with options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkJJkr"&gt;The update is minor, but Google is at least paying attention to an operating system that’s mainly received minor updates for a while. Google opened up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525335/google-wear-os-tiles-widgets-new-feature-announced"&gt;Tiles&lt;/a&gt; on the OS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22328909/google-third-party-developers-tiles-wear-os"&gt;third-party developers earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and before that, promised to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366514/google-wear-os-fall-update-smartwatch-faster-apps-weather-pairing"&gt;improve to CPU performance&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; — the company’s developer conference — on the horizon, there’s a possibility Google has more improvements to share for Wear OS, but until then, be happy you can at least swipe to type on your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AvW0zb"&gt;Another “out-of-control” Chinese rocket stage in orbit has spawned a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/politics/chinese-rocket-earth-scn/index.html"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/04/out-of-control-chinese-rocket-tumbling-to-earth"&gt;cycle&lt;/a&gt;. But for people on Earth, there’s not much to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yP3EE3"&gt;The 100-foot-tall, 22-metric-ton corpse of a Chinese Long March 5B rocket that launched the first chunk of Beijing’s new space station last week will reenter Earth’s atmosphere sometime this weekend, and there’s an extremely high chance that pieces of the rocket will splash down in the ocean, analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkmUnT"&gt;“Much of the earth is covered in water, so there’s almost no risk,” said Dan Oltrogge, founder of the Space Safety Coalition and top policy expert at AGI’s Commercial Space Operations Operations Center. The risk to the public isn’t zero, he said, “but it’s a whole lot less” if it’s heading for the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tERdtG"&gt;The US Space Command, which helps track the roughly 27,000 human-made pieces of junk in orbit, is tracking the location of the Long March rocket stage, “but its exact entry point into the Earth’s atmosphere cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its reentry,” it said in a statement, estimating the rocket will reenter this Saturday, May 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N5yZbE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The likelihood of any human being getting hit is quite low. It’s extremely low, let’s call it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ChemEE"&gt;Most core rocket stages don’t enter orbit. They usually splash down in the ocean right after launch after boosting another smaller rocket stage into orbit. But China’s Long March 5B rocket has a unique design that puts the entire first stage into low-Earth orbit to deliver its payload — a 22.5-metric-ton Tianhe module that will serve as living quarters for China’s new space station in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgfoAp"&gt;The rocket body is now dead, and it can’t be maneuvered or controlled. It’s orbiting Earth diagonally at a 41.5-degree inclination (or tilt) from the equator. That means it passes over a large swath of Earth, anywhere as far south as Chile and the top half of New Zealand, and as far north as New York and Madrid. But a majority of that orbital swath covers international waters, indicating chances of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/31/16830890/chinese-space-station-tiangong-1-debris-falling-to-earth"&gt;reentry over a populated area is slim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pKfnJ"&gt;“The likelihood of any human being getting hit is quite low. It’s extremely low, let’s call it.” Oltrogge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzTD7G"&gt;There are still some valid concerns about space safety. Launching a massive rocket stage into low-Earth orbit, where traffic between satellites and space junk is sharply increasing, is risky. And it is possible for parts of the rocket to survive the fiery plunge back through Earth’s atmosphere. Pieces of a Long March 5B rocket &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256484/china-rocket-debris-africa-uncontrolled-reentry-long-march-5b"&gt;fell from the sky over&lt;/a&gt; Côte d’Ivoire in Africa last year after sending an experimental satellite into space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5EqFPv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I expect significant pieces to reach the surface of the Earth”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyKruN"&gt;“Objects reenter almost every day, and once every few months there’s some stuff that reaches the ground,” Harvard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said in an email. “But this is only the second time (after last year’s reentry of the same rocket type) in 30 years that something this massive has reentered uncontrolled.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k44siL"&gt;Tiangong-1, China’s first prototype space station that launched in 2011, was another massive object that uncontrollably reentered in 2018 but mostly broke up in the atmosphere over the South Pacific Ocean. “By the time of reentry it was 7 tonnes, so it was significantly smaller than” the size of Long March 5B upon its expected reentry, McDowell said. “I expect significant pieces to reach the surface of the Earth - maybe up to several 100 kg [220 lbs] fragments,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jk3dfc"&gt;Though reentries are super common, and most objects never survive their trip through the atmosphere, they’re somewhat hard to predict, Space Force commander Gen. John Raymond told reporters on Thursday during an unrelated call about his military branch’s digital capabilities to track objects in space. “As we get closer, that data will get refined. But space command’s tracking this, they’re all over it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69FHFR"&gt;In the unlikely event a fragment of the Long March stage &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;hit land — and that’s not to say that land will inevitably be populated — it may have international legal ramifications. Under the 1972 Space Liability Convention treaty, countries are liable for the objects they launch to space. But “engaging the Liability Convention is as much a foreign policy decision as a legal one,” says Chris Newman, a professor of space law at Northumbria University in the UK. “The ‘victim’ state may be heavily dependent on the ‘liable’ state for infrastructure or investment and might not wish to rock the boat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qlv3pF"&gt;The US would expect China to pay for any damage caused by its rocket stage, a US State Department spokesperson said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FndDp7"&gt;“China, like the United States, is Party to the Liability Convention and as such, would be liable to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight,” the spokesperson said. “We encourage all States to operate transparently and responsibly in conducting their space activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGZfhv"&gt;In the meantime, there are a billion other things you can worry about besides China’s rocket stage, like the current &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396522/us-climate-change-commitment-paris-agreement-joe-biden"&gt;climate crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/boba-shortage.html"&gt;pandemic-induced shortage of Boba Tea&lt;/a&gt; (if you’re into that), or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22401253/elon-musk-hosting-saturday-night-live-miley-cyrus-tesla-spacex"&gt;Elon Musk’s potentially cringe-worthy appearance&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lbyCY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, May 6th, 6:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This story was updated to add comment from a State Department spokesperson. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
