    <title>Razer Blade 15 Advanced review: the new hotness</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A technical achievement that struggles to hide its seams&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Zl4w6R"&gt;When I last reviewed Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced in late 2020, I accused the company of resting on its laurels when it came to laptop design. Some of its competitors, namely the MSI GS66 Stealth, did a lot of catching up. And until recently, Razer hadn’t responded with much beyond minor (but welcome) design tweaks and spec refreshes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyFBtk"&gt;But Razer has actually answered back in two major ways so far in 2021. One is with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;, which packs a very capable AMD processor and Nvidia RTX graphics card into a compact 14-inch laptop. The other is the newer Blade 15 Advanced. It’s very similar to previous versions, but if you look a little closer, it addresses some repeated criticisms from prior models while retaining its signature excellent build quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W4EiH7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10804924"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g1ikgZ"&gt;The Blade 15 Advanced, starting with the mid-2021 lineup, has a more fingerprint-resistant design, and its webcam has been bumped up from 720p resolution to 1080p. The most interesting model of the bunch is technically the least capable one, the base model I’m reviewing here. It’s about 15.8mm thick, trimming away a little more than one millimeter compared to the other Blade 15 Advanced options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GkaGM"&gt;Thinner is good and all, but Razer also deserves credit for making sure that many of the fundamentals didn’t get axed during the size reduction. This model has a good port selection that includes Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, and an SD card reader. So, not only does it look good, but it’s still practical as well. Its fast refresh rate QHD display is also fantastic, as are its keyboard and trackpad. To my surprise, its 65Wh battery boasts decent performance for a gaming laptop, pulling in about six hours of use under the load of normal workday tasks, like using Chrome, Spotify, Slack, and some Affinity Photo (the thicker Blade 15 Advanced variants have 80Wh batteries). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tN0ftd"&gt;The thinner Blade 15 Advanced is fully featured in many other ways I expect a gaming laptop to be. It has an RTX 3060 graphics chip, a capable processor, and user-upgradeable RAM and storage (it has just one M.2 slot compared to the two in thicker models). Impressively, it’s just a hair thinner than the thickest spot on Apple’s latest MacBook Air. Let that sink in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ev4WUK534RcudNXW8oCBkXhoSps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822466/akrales_210831_4735_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 15 is still among the best-looking laptops (gaming or not) available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mIPLvi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10804932"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ho0W1F"&gt;Okay, now let’s get real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuPcjU"&gt;The price of this model is steep. It costs $2,299, which is easily a $600-$700 premium (if not more) over most other models with similar specs (sans QHD display). That’s hardly an issue if you can afford it. But a bigger pain point that money won’t solve is its cooling. While it’s not uncommon for gaming laptops to be in a persistent state of warmness, this laptop felt very hot near the screen’s hinge during gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRM4pR"&gt;After boosting the system’s CPU and GPU performance to the maximum in Razer Synapse, its built-in tool for adjusting power settings and for customizing the backlit keyboard, a few rounds of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;caused its CPU temperature to climb up to 100 degrees Celsius. It felt, at that point, well beyond what I consider to be a comfortable temperature for a device that’s meant to be placed on my lap. I shared these results with Razer, which asked for the unit back for testing. The company sent another, and it fared about the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1JLPo"&gt;I didn’t notice any signs of performance-related throttling due to the high temperature. It’s just a laptop that runs hot during intensive tasks. This is less of an issue if you plan to plug in accessories you already own, like a mouse and keyboard, and push the Blade 15 Advanced back on your desk. According to Razer, this is all expected behavior, and the company says it isn’t indicative of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pk3WvNPkvxwGj6ux8fRYnJvLBHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822459/akrales_210831_4735_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, no fingerprints in sight. The new coating is more resistant to smudges, but you’ll still need to clean it sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuPFpB"&gt;Here’s a statement that Razer provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on this Blade 15 Advanced model’s heating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hSD1Nk"&gt;“We’ve found that when running at maximum performance settings, the Blade can reach high internal temperatures, though after a short amount of time level out to and typically do not exceed 90C. These internal temperatures are safe to run and with our improved vapor chamber cooling solution, still lead to a comfortable external temperature for regular use well below the internal thermals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tEtC6M"&gt;If you ask me, I think you should reconsider purchasing this model if you imagined gaming primarily on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcBdse"&gt;There is some good news to come out of this that I think Razer and I can agree on: gaming performance with this Blade 15 Advanced is good. It’s one of the few laptops out there that pairs an RTX 3060 (a somewhat low-powered one, at that, with 85W maximum graphics power and 1,282MHz boost clock) and a QHD screen. I’ve written in several laptop reviews now that making the leap to QHD over FHD is definitely worth your money if you can swing it — and if the laptop itself is powerful enough to run most applications and games without crumbling under the load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHIBlv"&gt;After playing a few demanding games on this thinner Blade 15 Advanced model, it’s safe to say that it tackles that challenge of playing AAA games with high graphical settings at QHD resolution with more ease than I expected it to — you know, aside from being toasty throughout. The aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;maintained a fairly steady 50 frames per second at native resolution with almost all settings set to their highest. I encountered a minor isolated issue for this game; it repeatedly warned me that I had surpassed VRAM usage, claiming that this RTX 3060 had less memory than it actually did. Though, it didn’t crash or prevent me from playing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI__AIwmwxStBtaqmY7zfSHGhgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822461/akrales_210831_4735_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer gets kudos for including a robust set of ports in this thin build, including several USB-A ports and an SD card reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYKlNXUh25HHjof7GHRsecxfru0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822460/akrales_210831_4735_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse at the left edge of the Blade 15 Advanced. I totally own up to forgetting to remove the film around the charging port before the photo shoot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LkijAT"&gt;Other games didn’t present such issues, and ran decently, too. At QHD resolution, ultra settings, and with DLSS and ray tracing on, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s built-in benchmark ran at an average of 48 frames per second. With that result, you’re just a few setting adjustments away from a steady 60 frames per second at native resolution. With DLSS (auto mode) and ultra settings on in QHD resolution, &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; got up to 53 frames per second. &lt;em&gt;Hunt: Showdown&lt;/em&gt; ran the most effortlessly of any game that I tested, easily achieving 60 frames per second in native 1440p resolution with graphical settings set to their highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBdOwU"&gt;Games look great and are full of sharp detail and color on this QHD screen, though its 240Hz refresh rate is a far higher ceiling that many games won’t reach with this laptop. You’ll be lucky to push this screen even half of its peak refresh rate with modern games, which is an achievement unto itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J18BcT"&gt;The more money you’re willing to spend on a gaming laptop, the fewer (if any) settings you’ll need to adjust in order to more reliably surpass that coveted 60 frames per second bar. It’s not a huge issue that this Blade 15 Advanced can’t exactly get there in some games, so long as you know about it before you buy. It is, however, more of an issue when you look toward the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9K2LAfCwv0EH9O6RKFoUcTDUOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822467/akrales_210831_4735_0119.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer, your QHD displays are simply superb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QDoldg"&gt;The evolution of graphical tech means some games will only require more power to run, not less. For a laptop like this that only has fairly limited headroom, both in terms of power and cooling, that’s a problem that I had a hard time not thinking about during this review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjSKu0"&gt;Though, the future is made a little less scary because of Nvidia’s deep-learning super sampling (DLSS). Turning it on means you run games at a lower resolution, yet the RTX GPU’s AI cores utilize Nvidia’s neural network to improve the image quality to make it appear as if you haven’t lowered the resolution at all. In some of those tests above, the Blade 15 Advanced was able to squeeze out an average of 10 frames per second more than when the DLSS tech was turned off. It’s impressive stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dn8dNw"&gt;This particular Blade 15 Advanced won’t win in a spec shootout against Blade 14 that has an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX and an RTX 3070, particularly for gaming. But it has the advantage with some creative tasks, thanks to its Intel processor’s Quick Sync Video feature. In our export test, which puts out a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, it took this review unit just over three minutes, thirty seconds to run through the paces. In PugetBench for Premiere Pro, a benchmark that runs a bevy of demanding tasks and outputs an aggregate score, &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=59045"&gt;the Blade 15 Advanced scored almost 200 points higher&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44616"&gt;Blade 14 that my colleague Monica Chin reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, and several hundred points higher than &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=32198"&gt;the Razer Blade 15 Base from early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. If you plan to copy footage to the Blade 15 Advanced with its SD card slot, you can rest easy knowing that your time to export should be pretty speedy with this laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtmFHc"&gt;Using the new Blade 15 Advanced on a day-to-day basis is a similar experience to that of previous versions, and in most ways that’s a good thing. Razer’s keyboard is easy to type on, and the layout is easy to transition to from using a full-sized keyboard. Though, after using several other gaming laptop keyboards, it’d be great if Razer would try to make its own compact mechanical key switches, like Alienware does with its premium Cherry ultra-low profile switches. There’s nothing wrong with what’s here, but sometimes the keys can feel a little mushy. I have no complaints about the trackpad, though, as it remains one of the biggest you can find on a gaming laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7gIEugjpLZR4nVlyeBgNffD-7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822462/akrales_210831_4735_0052.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The improved webcam is one of the key highlights in the latest Blade 15 Advanced refresh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3Cq1z"&gt;Focusing on two new improvements for this newer wave of Blade laptops — the fingerprint-resistant coating and the improved 1080p webcam — the webcam is the more meaningful update of the two. I didn’t have a previous iteration with a 720p webcam to compare it to directly, but even in my apartment that gets a low amount of natural light, the picture looked a little sharper than I remember it being before, with slightly improved low-light performance. Video footage still looks a bit grainy, particularly in online video chats, but it’s certainly a positive step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="q3lJeD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10804929"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v1SkQI"&gt;For the fingerprint-resistant coating — look, this laptop still collects your fingerprints. Though, I realized it was an improvement when I didn’t yell the same “wow, I barely touched this thing and it’s &lt;em&gt;filthy&lt;/em&gt;” that I usually do shortly after I unbox a black Razer laptop. But if you’re a clean freak, you’ll probably still find enough smudging to warrant giving it a wipe every couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDz5lg"&gt;This particular Blade 15 Advanced stands out from Razer’s other models, including some competing gaming laptops, because of how thin it is. Its thickness is an asset, but also a major downside when it comes to keeping cool. Gaming on it isn’t a problem, unless you actually want to comfortably use it on your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJlbJw"&gt;I don’t have a solution for Razer, or really any company, on this one. At a certain point, the quest to push the power envelope in thinner gaming-focused devices is going to be hindered by how much airflow they can allow, and it seems like Razer’s is approaching the ceiling here. Still, I’m impressed with many aspects of the Blade 15 Advanced, particularly that it’s so similar to thicker, more powerful variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gw1emV82Z8sIPiQB3iROf70G6TQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822458/akrales_210831_4735_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even though it’s thinner than ever before, it still has the familiar Blade 15 design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WDw0TB"&gt;If you want a recommendation that’s in Razer’s realm, &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14-%2FRZ09-0370BEA3-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out the Blade 14 variant that costs $2,199&lt;/a&gt; ($100 less than this reviewed model) that has an AMD processor, an RTX 3070, and a QHD screen. It’s a little thicker, so heating shouldn’t be as much of a concern. You’ll lose the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the SD card reader, along with a 1080p webcam (it’s 720p instead) and the ability to operate on its RAM and storage. Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;check out our buying guide for the best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; where you’ll find several cheaper and faster options, even if they’re a bit thicker than this razor-thin Blade 15 Advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We might get a System Shock live-action series before System Shock 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="System Shock TV series key art: a poster of SHODAN." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ToMKh7jWbk5Co6SF7jlyjbvxpY=/222x0:1572x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69989013/Binge_SystemShock_LiveAction_Wide.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FoN0G6"&gt;A live-action &lt;em&gt;System Shock &lt;/em&gt;series is apparently on the table for games-focused streaming platform Binge, marking a third attempt at reviving the classic space horror series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOl4Ip"&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/system-shock-live-action-series-based-on-video-game-franchise-in-the-works-from-binge-nightdive-studios-1234854806/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; has offered&lt;/a&gt; a few details about the project, including that it will be executive produced by executives from NightDive — a studio and retro games publisher that &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/many-questions-system-shock-2-comes-to-gog"&gt;acquired the remarkably tangled rights to &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2013. It’s being produced by Binge chief content officer Allan Ungar, and it’s supposed to be part of Binge’s original content lineup as the platform &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/09/binge-will-debut-in-2022-as-a-game-and-entertainment-streaming-video-platform/"&gt;prepares for a 2022 launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ycP1C"&gt;There’s a heavy emphasis on “supposed to” here because &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; adaptations have a troubled history. NightDive successfully released the long-unavailable 1994 shooter &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; and its 1999 sequel &lt;em&gt;System Shock 2, &lt;/em&gt;more than a decade after the demise of original developer Looking Glass. But it’s faced more challenges with a crowdfunded remaster of the original game — which was &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock"&gt;funded in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, slated for release in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/16/17016744/system-shock-reboot-hiatus-nightdive-interview"&gt;placed on hiatus in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently listed as “coming soon” after missing its &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/25/22301179/system-shock-remake-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;latest release date&lt;/a&gt; of summer 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upFHZS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The System Shock game reboot is supposed to come out this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xwGcL0"&gt;Another studio, OtherSide Entertainment, has had even more difficulty with a sequel. &lt;em&gt;System Shock 3&lt;/em&gt; was announced in 2015, appeared as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18272003/system-shock-3-teaser-trailer-gdc-2019-unity"&gt;a teaser trailer in 2019&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-28-the-fall-of-swedish-game-wonder-starbreeze"&gt;near-collapse of its publisher&lt;/a&gt; Starbreeze and was &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/tencent-appears-to-be-the-new-owner-of-system-shock-3-and-4-websites/"&gt;acquired by the Chinese megapublisher Tencent&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. It’s currently listed as “in development” on OtherSide’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCso4V"&gt;There’s not much information on Binge’s live-action show. “I’ve always believed that a live-action adaptation of System Shock would be the perfect medium to retell the harrowing story of Citadel station and its rogue AI that subjects the crew to unimaginable horror,” &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; quotes NightDive CEO Stephen Kick as saying. (In case you’re not familiar with &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;: it’s set in 2072 on a corporate space station called Citadel where a hacker must defeat a rogue artificial intelligence named SHODAN, seen in the art above.) “We’re very excited to see the talented team at Binge bring System Shock to life in horrifyingly real and new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfC1m4"&gt;If you’re curious what a non-interactive version of &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; might look like, author Shamus Young published &lt;a href="https://www.shamusyoung.com/shocked/"&gt;a fanfiction story&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Free Radical&lt;/em&gt; that’s effectively an unofficial novelization of the game. If a live-action TV version pans out, too, you’ll see the resulting series stream exclusively on Binge.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals, our weekly newsletter, highlights the best deals of the week, exclusive discounts, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="REzNJI"&gt;Every day, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; scours the web looking for and writing about the best tech deals — but did you know many of these highlights can also be found in our newsletter? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syq4Vn"&gt;Each week, we deliver the top tech deals and sales straight to your inbox. We look for the kind of discounts we rarely see on items that are truly good investments — not small price drops on mediocre goods. These are deals on products we’ve tested, used, or feel confident in recommending, from laptops and 4K TVs to the latest smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp3hAf"&gt;Occasionally, we even treat our readers to exclusive deals. Recent newsletter subscribers, for instance, were amongst the first to find out about the $150 discount we’re currently offering on a standard ticket to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt;, our 10th-anniversary birthday bash in New York City. You, too, can also take advantage of the deal when you enter promo code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEDEALS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout, which brings down the price of a single ticket from $250 to $99. The event — which takes place on October 22nd and 23rd — will feature live performances, guest speakers, interactive experiences, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaqaL96kykhKMgza4evkZ3D53Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890722/Stage_2__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TYaM2I"&gt;At the moment, we’re sending the biweekly newsletter on Wednesday and Friday, but we’ll let you know if we start doing so more frequently. Deals change all the time, however, which is why we’ll also continue to post the contents of the Friday newsletter on the site on Saturday mornings, with the necessary updates. That’s because we want to make sure you’re always up to date and getting the best bang for your buck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwNjKk"&gt;So if you want to take advantage of a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;-approved deal before it sells out, consider subscribing via the box below or by visiting our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;newsletter landing page&lt;/a&gt;, where you can subscribe to HotPod and other &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;newsletters. And if you ever feel like you don’t want these emails, you can easily unsubscribe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat is back up, after users couldn’t post or send messages for hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h0qetljI3w5--QOjcQSbaeWN3PY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988409/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUmaBr"&gt;For a couple of hours on Wednesday morning, Snap Streaks were at risk as many users reported they couldn’t successfully post story updates or send messages on the service. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the Snapchat Support Twitter account confirmed the issues, telling people to “hang tight, we’re looking into it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZXmVN"&gt;The source of the issue was unclear, but this doesn’t seem to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"&gt;Facebook-level event&lt;/a&gt;. The app itself was still mostly functional for some of us, and if you weren’t trying to post, you may not have noticed anything wrong right away. It also wasn’t crashing constantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600902/snapchat-crashing-down-outage-issue-app-login"&gt;which has been a problem for Snapchat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhIUFK"&gt;At about 10:31AM ET the Snapchat Support Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448295237978365954"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the issue is fixed, and everything is working again on our end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KE8xvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some Snapchatters are having issues using the app right now - hang tight, we’re looking into it!&lt;/p&gt;— Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="pCAlHy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 11:17AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that Snapchat is back up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin successfully sends William Shatner and crew to edge of space and back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8mvnQDN2cZ3gGonQ6QTl41SBtw=/8x0:2180x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988895/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_10.54.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGRWvk"&gt;Famed Star Trek actor William Shatner and a crew of three fellow passengers successfully flew to the edge of space and back this morning on Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourist rocket. The foursome took off from Blue Origin’s launch facility in Van Horn, Texas at 9:50AM ET, climbed to an altitude of roughly 66 miles up, and then safely landed back on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVUxrv"&gt;Flying alongside Shatner today were two paying customers and a Blue Origin employee. They included Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of small satellite company Planet Labs, and Glen de Vries, co-founder of Medidata, a software company. Audrey Powers, vice president of mission and flight operations at Blue Origin, represented the company on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kBeecI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What you have given me is the most profound experience.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BvP35f"&gt;After Shatner landed, he shed tears, emotional about what just happened. “What you have given me is the most profound experience,” Shatner told Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos after the actor landed. “I’m so filled with emotion about what just happened. I just, it’s extraordinary, extraordinary. I hope I never recover from this.” Shatner argued afterward that everybody needs to see what he saw, even comparing the experience of transitioning from blue sky to the blackness of space to what dying might feel like. “Is that what death is?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IxzLP"&gt;This morning’s flight, lasting just a little over 10 minutes in length, marks the second successful crewed launch for Blue Origin on the New Shepard rocket. The company’s first crewed launch on July 20th carried Bezos, who is the former CEO of Amazon. He flew along with his brother, Mark, a Dutch teenager, and legendary aviator Wally Funk. When Funk flew, she became the oldest person in space at 82 years old, but this morning, 90-year-old Shatner surpassed her.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqLi6pJB47dgl98Mo12MGKHEdWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923418/blue_origin_ns18_training_astronauts_cm7_training_october_12_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crew of today’s flight: Audrey Powers, William Shatner, Chris Boshuizen, and Glen de Vries, with Crew Member 7 Sarah Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MPxcXm"&gt;New Shepard is the company’s primary rocket at the moment. The vehicle is suborbital, so it cannot achieve enough speed to get into orbit around the Earth. Instead, it’s capable of launching crews to the edge of space and back so that riders can experience weightlessness for a few minutes. To get to space, crews launch strapped inside a crew capsule, perched on top of the rocket. Once high above the Earth, the capsule and rocket separate and passengers briefly float throughout the cabin. Then, both pieces of the vehicle fall back to Earth; the capsule lands under parachutes while the rocket reignites its engine and lands upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WGa54"&gt;Though Shatner’s flight was ultimately a success, it comes amid a tumultuous time for Blue Origin. Just before the mission, 21 current and former employees published a damning essay, criticizing Blue Origin’s culture as both sexist and unsafe. A recent &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; investigation also revealed employees think Blue Origin has “an authoritarian bro culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEPdlb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GB6ZiL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit’s latest feature turns predictions into a tournament</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YcCR1OERsx3MYwuIwbBopiDudk=/0x0:1158x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988846/ApplicationFrameHost_sgcOT2vcbX.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users pick a prediction and bet tokens on the outcome.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Reddit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IB77Sp"&gt;Reddit has officially launched its new Predictions feature after piloting it for almost a year. It lets users compete by guessing the outcome of upcoming events like sports matches or awards ceremonies. Predictions build upon, and gamify, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21191119/reddit-poll-post-type-nfl-super-bowl-survey"&gt;site’s existing Polls feature&lt;/a&gt; from last year, allowing users to bet and earn tokens based on successful predictions as part of miniature tournaments. There’s no real money involved, just bragging rights, though Reddit says Premium members “&lt;a href="https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407383251860#:~:text=nope%2C%20no%20purchase%20necessary.%20however%2C%20reddit%20premium%20members%20may%20get%20special%20advantages%20or%20benefits%20in%20the%20future%2C%20so%20stay%20tuned!%20"&gt;may get special advantages or benefits in the future.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SW8IQ"&gt;Predictions tournaments can only be posted by moderators and consist of a series of questions for users to bet on the answers to. This list can be expanded by moderators as the tournament progresses. Each user who participates is given 1,000 free tokens to answer the questions posed, like which film could win Best Picture at the next Oscars. If they’re right, then they get a share of the winnings; but if they make too many wrong predictions and lose all their tokens, then they’re out of the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp-teOXHFX-IctVSCST4NUs8bEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923340/pasted_image_0__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example Prediction question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9P1m22"&gt;It’s important to note that although Reddit allows users to pay for features like Reddit Premium, the Predictions feature currently doesn’t involve any real money. Tokens are distributed for free to anyone who wants to take part, and at the end of the tournament they’re used to calculate a leaderboard of its winners. Tokens are nontransferable and cannot be carried over between tournaments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhK39q"&gt;Reddit has been testing its Predictions feature in select subreddits for almost a year now and says over a million people have already taken part in tournaments. Past tournaments have involved guessing the outcomes of the Oscars, the 2021 Formula 1 Grand Prix, and this year’s Euros soccer tournament. Now, however, the feature is rolling out to any subreddit with more than 10,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mJKyO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaming and apparel brand 100 Thieves is getting into hardware with its first acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGOPlaejsEvJvyQX3jy83KS9jI0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988746/100_Thieves_x_Higround_Collab_Keyboard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard made by 100 Thieves and Higround.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 100 Thieves&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gzFFxx"&gt;100 Thieves, a gaming organization known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;esports teams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21211236/100-thieves-apparel-collection-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch"&gt;apparel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372759/valkyrae-courage-100-thieves-co-owners-nadeshot"&gt;big-name streamers&lt;/a&gt;, is announcing its first acquisition: the gaming peripheral company &lt;a href="https://higround.co/password"&gt;Higround&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXb9Ic"&gt;If you aren’t familiar, Higround makes what might be best described as designer gaming peripherals. (To get an idea of what that means, check out &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/higround/"&gt;Higround’s Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, which is filled with pictures of colorful keyboards.) It releases its products in limited drops and says that every one of them has sold out. The company’s work even includes a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUfbp0kplMc/"&gt;Apple’s Beats&lt;/a&gt;, though it had a limited distribution and wasn’t for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwhPpU"&gt;100 Thieves is a gaming brand that’s similarly well known for its designer gear (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;in its case, apparel&lt;/a&gt;) that’s released in drops, so you might be able to see why it and Higround are something of a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoNj4K"&gt;“For a long time, your setup was just this generic canvas that everybody had,” 100 Thieves founder and CEO Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He talked about how the differences might have just come down to how many hertz your monitor was capable of or if someone else had a lighter mouse than you. With Higrounds, though, 100 Thieves sees an opportunity to help people make a desk setup that’s more representative of who they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="visMzx"&gt;Higround co-founder Rustin Sotoodeh discussed a similar vision. “Everyone should have access to an incredible keyboard or beautiful design,” Sotoodeh said, and he hopes he can make that a reality as a result of the acquisition. (That would include offering products that are always available, instead of just in drops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhfR3F"&gt;Haag also sees a chance to shake up the keyboard market. “From my perspective, unless you’re a keyboard enthusiast, if you’re a casual gamer and you go to the store, there’s only like two products that are offered: a black keyboard and a white keyboard,” Haag said. “And there’s a lot of brands that I have a ton of respect for, but I still think that there’s room in the market for there to be a marquee brand that everybody gravitates towards because of the stories that they tell and the image that they portray.” Higround recently brought on Baron Lee, a former HyperX executive, to head up product development, signaling that it’s staffing up to take on some of the big names in gaming peripherals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWSpoi8NkHVsw8pMsKK1Ya7Pkfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923148/Sandstone.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Higround&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Higround’s Sandstone keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mv0YND"&gt;Neither Haag nor Sotoodeh commented on the terms of the deal, but Haag did discuss how Higround will operate as an independent company. “What we want to help Higround do is just accelerate their growth,” Haag said. “We don’t want to take over their identity, we don’t want to go too far deep into 100 Thieves injecting its DNA into Higround.” A press release is more explicit, spelling out that 100 Thieves will “serve as an accelerator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLcJS1"&gt;As part of the acquisition, the two companies will team up on a “special product capsule,” which includes a hoodie and the custom keyboard (which you can see at the top of this post). You’ll be able to buy the capsule on October 15th at 3PM ET on &lt;a href="https://higround.co/"&gt;Higround’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FsnVN"&gt;It doesn’t sound like 100 Thieves is jumping into the deep end with hardware just yet, though. “Higround, from a hardware and peripherals standpoint, is our bet, and we’re going to help them as they continue to grow over the next couple of years,” Haag said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCWW5l"&gt;Haag also didn’t commit to making more acquisitions anytime soon. “R​​ight now, Higround is the main focus, and we’re excited to invest all of our resources and all of our time into helping them succeed,” he said. “And then we’ll see what comes down the road in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon India allegedly rigged search results and ripped off sellers’ products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hr6z_jiGUg19IEVXzjhVmAf-C6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988727/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="StEPDZ"&gt;Amazon allegedly used its search system and user data to gain an edge over sellers in India, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-rigging/"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report — based on internal emails, strategy plans, and other documents — outlines an ambitious plan to dominate the platform with its in-house brands. According to the documents, that plan included strategies that Amazon has vehemently denied using amid antitrust scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLy8TG"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; story provides extensive details about Amazon India’s alleged activity, but two key pieces stand out. The first is a claim that Amazon employees used “search seeding” (or boosting the rankings of specific product listings) to ensure that company brands like AmazonBasics appeared “in the first two or three” search results for a category. The second, more extensive allegation involves Amazon identifying “reference” or “benchmark” products that are popular with customers and then copying them. At least two high-level executives allegedly reviewed the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hHfCbl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The claims mirror earlier accusations against Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjIAKR"&gt;Amazon’s copying process apparently went beyond simply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20982653/allbirds-ceo-amazon-copy-shoe-environment-sustainability-steal"&gt;cloning the look&lt;/a&gt; of well-known products. The documents reportedly indicate Amazon India employees examined internal data like how often customers returned purchases and then designed products based around it. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; quotes one 2016 report about an in-house brand called Solimo, whose strategy was to “use information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products to our customers.” The report also described plans to partner with the original manufacturers of reference products to capture “unique processes which impact the end quality of the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsHX4G"&gt;Amazon denied the allegations in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, calling them “factually incorrect and unsubstantiated.” But they mirror claims from other countries. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015?mod=article_inline"&gt;A 2020 &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; found that Amazon employees had studied detailed internal sales data to help it crush independent sellers with competing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKAk1k"&gt;Amazon told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; that the tactic was strictly prohibited among employees and denied the claims in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;a US congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21347083/jeff-bezos-amazon-tech-antitrust-hearing-jayapal-questioning"&gt;then-CEO Jeff Bezos said&lt;/a&gt; he couldn’t “guarantee” that the policy had never been violated. Throughout questioning, however, Bezos portrayed possible violations as the actions of rogue employees — not the kind of formal strategy that &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjNPFx"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/technology/amazon-bezos-india-antitrust.html"&gt;Amazon is under investigation in India&lt;/a&gt; for alleged anti-competitive behavior. (Regulators are also investigating its Walmart-backed competitor Flipkart.) The investigation covers potentially anti-competitive behavior around self-branded products like AmazonBasics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s new SoundLink Flex speaker has a rugged design and ‘astonishing’ sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1j9AV2SEpvuuG-0SlM9Q5KoFA8=/0x0:1385x923/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988678/Large_JPG_SLFBS_StoneBlue_0004_RGB.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TQPIB"&gt;Bose is introducing its first new portable Bluetooth speaker in quite a while. The $149 &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/pressroom/featured/soundlink_flex_bluetooth_speaker.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SoundLink Flex&lt;/a&gt; has a ruggedized design with an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, 12-hour battery life, and what Bose claims is “astonishing” audio performance for its size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTsjKG"&gt;At 7.9 inches wide, 3.6 inches high, 2.1 inches deep, and weighing slightly over one pound, the SoundLink Flex is nicely compact and has a built-in utility loop for attaching to a carabiner. It’ll be sold in three colors: there’s black, smoke white, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTHocw"&gt;Inside the SoundLink Flex is a custom transducer that Bose says is “as big as could fit” and capable of producing “bass that you can feel in your chest.” Using a feature that Bose calls “PositionIQ,” the speaker can detect what orientation its in — upright, hanging, or flat on its back — and tune audio output accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/as8hJjVPfsoPXe6NCoOamt8DGfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923469/Large_JPG_SLFBS_Black_0280_RGB.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speaker is designed to withstand the elements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eDLoA"&gt;The speaker has a silicone back and powder-coated steel grille, and Bose claims it’s designed to resist corrosion and fend off any discoloration from UV light. With that IP67 rating, it’s a pool-safe speaker, and Bose says it’ll float to the surface when dropped into water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q48L61"&gt;There’s nothing particularly “smart” about the SoundLink Flex, but it can be linked up with any Bose smart speakers or soundbars you’ve got at home. And you can stereo pair it with another SoundLink Flex or a different Bose portable speaker. There’s also a built-in microphone for taking calls and interacting with the voice assistant on your phone. (Bose still sells the much pricier Portable Smart Speaker for $400 with built-in voice capabilities, but you can do better for less money than that.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w3vekH"&gt;At $149, the SoundLink undercuts products like the Sonos Roam, though it doesn’t match that speaker’s wide set of features. Bose also has to contend with impressive Bluetooth speaker competition from JBL, UE, and others. Still, the company’s portable speakers have a way of sounding much better than you’d expect based on their size, so I’m looking forward to hearing what the SoundLink Flex is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s new ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition laptop uses eye-tracking cameras for a glasses-free 3D display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SzP9zSjJVlMXSPyBLCrTKJ76fyE=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69988540/ConceptD_7_SpatialLabs_Edition_CN715_73G_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3BtWws"&gt;Acer is finally bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro"&gt;glasses-free 3D SpatialLabs tech&lt;/a&gt; to a laptop you can buy: the company has officially announced the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L6hfTo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Acer’s new SpatialLabs tech brings 3D content to laptop screens","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OPdIS9"&gt;Announced earlier this year, SpatialLabs combines a suite of hardware and software features. These features include a special stereo camera with two sensors that track your eyes and head, an optical lens on the display that refracts the two slightly different images to your eyes, and rendering software that adjusts the 3D images in real time as you move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylCGQG"&gt;As part of its ConceptD lineup of products for designers and developers, Acer’s pitch here is that the 3D display will allow for users to see 3D projects for CAD designs, 3D printing, architecture, or animation in three dimensions, instead of trying to approximate things on a 2D screen. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Monica Chin got to try out the hardware earlier this year and called it “quite impressive,” even if the actual usefulness of the technology still remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z0JmW9lB68-K2gx6RYOvqVe8xH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22923500/ConceptD_7_SpatialLabs_Edition_CN715_73G_Lifestyle_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer imagines developers using the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition as a design tool alongside larger displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BlsWka"&gt;Of course, a 3D display is nothing without 3D content, and Acer is providing a few tools out of the box, like the SpatialLabs Model Viewer, which allows you to import 3D files from apps like Autodesk Fusion 360, Rhinoceros, and ZBrush. It also says that it’s working with developers on more integrated solutions for the future, although the limited availability of the tech to this single laptop (so far) means that rollout will likely be slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1fQrt"&gt;The company is also offering a SpatialLabs Go app, with AI enhancements that Acer says will allow you to convert 2D content (including “videos, images, simple games, and the webcam feed of participants during a video conference or video call”) to stereoscopic 3D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5r5Ni"&gt;Fancy 3D tricks aside, the rest of the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition is a top-tier laptop (it has to be, in order to accomplish all the real-time rendering and 3D modeling for which Acer envisions it being used). While Acer isn’t offering exact configurations yet, it can be configured with Intel Core i7-11800H processors, up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM (which is user upgradable to up to 64GB), an Nvidia RTX 3080, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. There’s only a single display option, naturally: a 15.6-inch LCD panel that offers 3840 x 2160 resolution in 2D mode or 1920 x 2160 in 3D mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M5dMd"&gt;That kind of hardware doesn’t come cheap, though: Acer says that the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition will launch in December in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa starting at an eye-watering €3,599 (or about $4,160.32). It’ll also be available in North America sometime in 2022, but the exact price and release date haven’t been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new ConceptD 3 Ezel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c9EeNZ"&gt;Acer is also updating its other ConceptD 3 laptops today: the clamshell ConceptD 3 and ConceptD 3 Pro are getting new 16-inch displays with 16:10 aspect ratios, in addition to a new 15.6-inch convertible ConceptD 3 Ezel and ConceptD 3 Ezel (which brings the existing hinge design that Acer has offered on its convertible laptops to a more affordable price point). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz1v7m"&gt;The 16-inch ConceptD 3 and ConceptD 3 Pro will be available in the US in January 2022, starting at $1,699.99 and $1,899.99, respectively. The ConceptD 3 Ezel will be available in November, starting at $1,899.99, while the ConceptD 3 Ezel Pro will hit the US in 2022 starting at $1,999.99.&lt;/p&gt;
