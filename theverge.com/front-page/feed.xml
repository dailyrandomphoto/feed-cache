    <title>Telegram says it ‘shut down hundreds of public calls for violence’ in US last week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FiuRUa"&gt;Amid rising political tensions in the United States, Telegram founder Pavel Durov says his chat service has taken down hundreds of public calls for violence, in accordance with the platform’s terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CYJIi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/149"&gt;In a public Telegram post on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Durov emphasized the service’s commitment to banning speech that actively incites violence. “Telegram welcomes peaceful debate and protest, but our Terms of Service explicitly prohibit distributing public calls to violence,” he wrote. “Сivil movements all over the world rely on Telegram in order to stand up for human rights without resorting to inflicting harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD9aH4"&gt;Notably, the post does not address Telegram’s encrypted chat feature, which protects conversations from outside access and thus is not subject to centralized moderation. Telegram has moderated against violence and terrorism in public rooms, but resisted mounting pressures to make those conversations more accessible to law enforcement. The rise of pro-Trump extremist violence in the United States has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/extremists-move-secret-line-channels-plan-inauguration-day-d-c-n1253876"&gt;rekindled the country’s debate about the value of encryption&lt;/a&gt;, and reinvigorated calls to weaken privacy protections for encrypted chat services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzTqOr"&gt;Durov said that Telegram had seen the same spike in violent threats that other US services have reported during the past month. “In early January, the Telegram moderation team started to receive an increased number of reports about US-related public activity on our platform,” the post reads. “The team acted decisively by clamping down on US channels that advocated violence. Thanks to these efforts, last week our moderators blocked and shut down hundreds of public calls for violence that could’ve otherwise reached tens of thousands of subscribers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUouTO"&gt;Telegram has seen a significant boost in users over the same period, in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;a disastrous change to WhatsApp’s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; that led many to flee the service. Signal also gained millions of users during the exodus, putting so much strain on the service’s infrastructure that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235707/signal-back-app-privacy-encrypted-outage"&gt;became inaccessible for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgKWD9"&gt;The sudden risk of political violence in the US has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;put unprecedented pressure&lt;/a&gt; on services that fail to moderate violent threats — most notably Parler, which became inaccessible after abruptly losing its hosting service last week. Amazon Web Services, Parler’s hosting provider at the time, had reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;more than a hundred violent threats on the network&lt;/a&gt; over the course of weeks, all of which Parler said did not violate its terms of service. In the wake of the Capitol Raid, AWS cut ties with the company, which combined with similar actions from Apple and Google to render the social network entirely inoperable. Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;posted a brief message to users&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, but has yet to fully restore service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re getting closer to a Nintendo Switch-sized gaming PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VFwJMMNhXkEdzKDkvp1r0UfYJA=/49x0:978x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68685793/aya_neo_death_stranding.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3WMuTR"&gt;One year ago at CES 2020 in Las Vegas, Alienware made waves with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048262/alienware-concept-ufo-prototype-gaming-pc-nintendo-switch-ces-2020"&gt;a modular gaming PC that worked like a Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, with a pair of gamepads flanking a powerful Windows 10 tablet. Sadly, Alienware’s UFO was just a concept, as was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/7/22218956/lenovo-nec-switch-pc-lavie-mini-ces-concept"&gt;Lenovo’s take on the idea&lt;/a&gt; this year — but two companies are now taking up the torch with a pair of crowdfunded gadgets you might actually see in your lifetime. They look seriously legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLmyqf"&gt;The 5.5-inch &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fgpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F18%2F22237379%2Faya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GPD Win 3&lt;/a&gt; and the 7-inch &lt;a href="https://www.ayadevice.com/space"&gt;Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt; aren’t going about it in quite the same way; while the Ava tries to closely match Nintendo’s console in shape, size, and with strictly gaming controls on board, the GPD sticks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/15/16892268/gpd-win-2-announcement-specs-price-release-date"&gt;its palmtop computer roots&lt;/a&gt; with a slide-up screen that reveals a tiny backlit keyboard. There’s also a fingerprint sensor, a microSD slot and an optional Thunderbolt 4 dock if you want to use the GPD like a full Windows 10 computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oHuhU1-jn0EaANMb3X3xC2Xe09k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22243625/gpd_win_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images by GPD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The GPD Win 3.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mvcnSJ"&gt;What’s the same: both are genuinely trying to deliver a powerful tablet surrounded by joysticks and buttons for under $1,000 each. With Intel’s latest Tiger Lake chips and AMD’s Ryzen 4500U respectively, each has some of the latest and greatest integrated graphics you can buy, and they claim pretty decent performance as a result — &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; can reportedly hit 30fps at the Aya Neo’s 1280x800 resolution at low settings, and GPD &lt;a href="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607940096/yunaqdrzpepmpashnqzm.png"&gt;offers a long list&lt;/a&gt; of examples of recent, demanding games that you can coax well over the 50fps mark with its Intel Xe graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmWtKA"&gt;As you can see in the spec comparo sheet I whipped up below, each features 16GB of DDR4 memory, a speedy NVMe solid state drive, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0, a pair of stereo speakers, a genuine headphone jack, and multiple USB ports. Not bad! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nEsiF0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10290467"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="boFsQu"&gt;Just know that these systems are going to be &lt;em&gt;chonky&lt;/em&gt; compared to an actual Nintendo Switch’s 0.55-inch thick frame and 0.88-pound weight, and battery life will be a big question, with both the Aya Neo and GPD Win 3 allowing you to fine-tune the chip’s TDP wattage to get the most out of their tablet-sized cells. &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/GPD-Win-3-Review-The-Unofficial-Microsoft-Switch.514859.0.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NotebookCheck&lt;/em&gt; says you shouldn’t expect&lt;/a&gt; to get more than 1.5 hours out of the GPD Win 3 while playing a demanding game, though &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3JBmIiuJwU"&gt;Taki Udon on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; claims you can get 2-3 hours out of an early Aya Neo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="u7xMie"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EGiAm"&gt;Speaking of Taki Udon’s video, it looks like a fantastic overview of the handheld, so I recommend checking it out, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX52EnF77EU"&gt;this second vid&lt;/a&gt; that shows off how well games like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sekiro &lt;/em&gt;play on his Founder’s model. It’s not enough to convince me to crowdfund a company I’ve never heard of, but it’s a good start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNW28S"&gt;You should also know that not all of these handhelds are going to look and play the same: the transparent Aya you’re seeing in the videos was a limited edition of 15,000 for early pre-orders in China, with final models launching &lt;a href="https://www.ayadevice.com/post/more-informations-about-igg-campaign"&gt;in black and white&lt;/a&gt; instead when they ship in April. Aya will be launching its Indiegogo campaign in February with a “super early bird limited price” of $699, with no word on how much the rest of us might pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk8nxo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fgpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F1%2F18%2F22237379%2Faya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The GPD Win 3 is already on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll pay $799 for the Core i5-1135G7 version, with the more powerful i7 chip starting at $899, or $949 for a package with the optional USB, HDMI and Gigabit Ethernet docking station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVX60Z"&gt;Between these handheld gaming PCs, the cute upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542841/playdate-games-handheld-panic-delay-2021"&gt;Playdate&lt;/a&gt; and the gorgeous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;squeaky clean mods&lt;/a&gt; we’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205558/new-record-smallest-nintendo-64-mod-gmanmodz-cartridge-sized"&gt;of late&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550621/nintendo-earnings-q2-2020-switch-sales"&gt;popularity of the Switch itself&lt;/a&gt; and the march of ever smaller and more powerful chips, it feels like we might be entering a gaming handheld renaissance. Here’s hoping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHJTM7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s okay to let kids play Fortnite during a global pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fortnite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M9fJ9RxWDKz5BMr2RtP7FswnB1E=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68685686/Fortnite_20190504150224.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Db77f3"&gt;On Sunday, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/health/covid-kids-tech-use.html"&gt;an article about the risks of sky-rocketing teenage device usage&lt;/a&gt; during quarantine — and as you might expect, they went straight for the guilty-parent touchstones. There are maudlin photos of a family ruined by gaming, and the quote “I’ve failed you as a father” comes in the second sentence. There are also curious comparisons to drug addiction (“There will be a period of epic withdrawal” after quarantine, one addiction expert warns) and vague claims about the impressionable nature of young brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZPaL"&gt;Before you rush to cut off junior’s Playstation Plus subscription, it’s worth putting things in perspective. We’re in the middle of a worldwide crisis, and the last ten months have been hard on everyone. We’ve seen historic jumps in depression and substance abuse even among adults, and healthy escapes are increasingly hard to come by. Digital entertainment has gotten &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150661/entertainment-2020-music-games-movies-comfort-favorites"&gt;a lot of us&lt;/a&gt; through the past year in one piece. For many kids, it’s one of the few places to carry on a semi-normal social life, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201807/children-adolescents-screentime-coronavirus-how-to-psychiatrist"&gt;many experts have emphasized&lt;/a&gt; a balanced approach rather than an outright cutoff. Digital interaction is an incredibly valuable thing, and dismissing it because of abstract screen panic is irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4unZna"&gt;The article briefly touches on online socializing, but saves it for a kind of ironic afterthought at the end. After cutting her son off from Xbox games for a few weeks, a parent notes, “it makes me feel badly when I try to restrict him. It’s his only socialization.” For a lot of kids, this is the whole point: online spaces like Fortnite are the only way to hang out with their friends. There is actual socializing happening here, and as long as in-person contact is a public health hazard, these are the only places it can happen. It’s important for kids to hang out with other kids, so cutting off screen time is actively isolating, damaging in ways that are far more concrete than screen time. The only reason to dismiss it is the lingering idea that online socializing somehow doesn’t count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8MA3C"&gt;What we’re seeing has less to do with screen time and more to do with the age-old problems of teen social lives. There are lots of healthy and social things you can do online, just like there are unhealthy and isolating things you can do offline. Whether it happens on a screen just isn’t the primary issue. It’s fine to worry about unhealthy spaces online, whether it’s eating-disorder culture on Instagram or incel sewers on Reddit — but the problem with those spaces is that they’re unhealthy, not that they’re online. Casting the internet as the problem just confuses things, and encourages parents to cut off one of their kids’ few healthy social outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ae8HE8"&gt;On some level, I understand the anxiety here. Parents are allowed to be depressed and anxious too! There is a ton to be stressed about in the world right now, and watching your kid play Xbox through it all might make you feel like you’re watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sJO0n6kvPRU?t=121"&gt;Ed Westwick play holocube in &lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure it’s alienating to watch your son play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; all day, but if you’re that worried about losing touch, it might be time to pick up a controller and spend some time in their world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capitol rioter planned to sell Nancy Pelosi’s laptop to Russian spies, witness told FBI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rmxt8wYTnr8WGE2WZ7-zeiaLjjk=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68684939/1230505103.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="25Xbhm"&gt;A capitol rioter may have stolen Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s laptop with plans to sell it to the Russian government, &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20458358-riley-williams-affidavit"&gt;according to an FBI affidavit&lt;/a&gt; filed on Sunday. The affidavit charges Riley June Williams with unlawful entry and impeding government functions, based on extensive video record placing her at the scene of the Capitol riot. But the affidavit also uncovers an apparent plan to steal Speaker Pelosi’s laptop and convey it to a contact in Russia, who would then make contact with the country’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3h5XWQ"&gt;Williams was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzJs4MfTe0"&gt;identified by UK media&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, and officers confirmed the identification with her driver’s license photo (on file with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation) and in an in-person interview with her parents. Notably, public videos show Williams directing rioters to the general location of Pelosi’s office, consistent with the idea that she intended to ransack the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qe7igk"&gt;According to the affidavit, a former associate of Williams told police she had planned to steal Speaker Pelosi’s laptop with the intention of selling it to the Russian government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0K8LF"&gt;“[The witness] stated that Williams intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service,” the affidavit reads. “According to [the witness], the transfer of the computer device to Russia fell through for unknown reasons and Williams still has the computer device or destroyed it. This matter remains under investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyuU9D"&gt;Reuters has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cyber/laptop-stolen-from-pelosis-office-during-storming-of-u-s-capitol-says-aide-idUSKBN29D2HA"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that a laptop was stolen from Pelosi’s office. According to an aide, the laptop was stationed in a conference room and “was used for presentations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMorAn"&gt;Device theft has been a significant concern for government IT workers in the wake of the capitol riot, which broke long-standing security procedures around congressional offices. The idea of devices being stolen or tampered with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/cybersecurity-202-riot-capitol-is-nightmare-scenario-cybersecurity-professionals/"&gt;was viewed&lt;/a&gt; as a “nightmare scenario” in the wake of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4R964I"&gt; “I don’t think I’d sleep well until the networks were rebuilt from scratch,” said one former House IT official on Twitter, “and every computer wiped and the internals visually inspected before being put back into service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxq79B"&gt;Williams remains at large, despite the ongoing investigation and public identification. She has discontinued her phone number and deleted social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram and Parler. After returning from the raid, she packed a bag and told her mother she would be gone “for a couple weeks,” the affidavit reads. “Williams did not provide her mother any information about her intended destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020 Game is a surprisingly fun side scroller about an awful year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e7hXaaeXQSX2OPeuIrOWTzNHEZc=/0x0:1090x727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68683707/msedge_nFgGLE9da9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020 Game draws inspiration from the biggest trends of last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: 2020 Game&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W7xw3a"&gt;I get it, there’s absolutely no part of you that wants to relive the terrible year we just lived through. But I implore you to make an exception for &lt;a href="https://2020game.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020 Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a free web-based side scroller that offers a lighthearted take on last year’s events. It’s well-designed, creative, and — dare I say it — even laugh-out-loud funny in places, and well worth the 10 minutes or so it takes to complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7IxUv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020 Game&lt;/em&gt; is the work of Max Garkavyy, who developed it alone over the course of six months. Each level takes the form of a major event or trend from last year, ranging from the early rush on toilet paper to the US presidential race. There’s even a brief TikTok dance interlude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9Q7zs"&gt;The whole experience is complimented by some fantastic pixel-art graphics and great musical choices. Check out some more screenshots below, or better yet, &lt;a href="https://2020game.io"&gt;give it a go yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of Parler videos from Capitol riot republished in chronological timeline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Parler logo is seen displayed..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AX7GzfEIIpjBFAkFOfqi5p3hSc=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68683606/1230591287.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M0uA4q"&gt;ProPublica has published a new &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/"&gt;interactive resource&lt;/a&gt; of over 500 videos taken in Washington, DC on January 6th, the day of the Capitol riots, offering an unfiltered look at the day’s events. The videos were sourced from Parler, the social network popular with Trump’s supporters, whose database of over one million videos &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/parlers-amateur-coding-could-come-back-to-haunt-capitol-hill-rioters/"&gt;was archived&lt;/a&gt; before the service was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;taken offline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dzfKQ"&gt;We’ve covered previous attempts to organize these videos into easy-to-view online resources, like this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231749/parler-interactive-map-video-gps-capitol-attack"&gt;interactive map from Patr10tic&lt;/a&gt;. But what’s notable about ProPublica’s site is how easily you can scrub through a timeline of videos and sort by general location: Around DC, Near Capitol, and Inside Capitol. You can start by watching videos of crowds attending President Trump’s inflammatory speech at midday, before seeing events turn violent over the course of the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u3Ks2spqDgqOzgkOczDu3GTMWHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22242766/msedge_xPEHn1C43u.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/" target="_blank"&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Videos are organized chronologically, and can be filtered based on location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zyp1w7"&gt;It’s an eye-opening resource which captures videos of the mob’s violent actions, including vandalism and threats against lawmakers. Since the videos are organized chronologically, you’ll often see the same scene captured from multiple angles, making it much easier to see what’s actually happening despite the chaos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKvQPf"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/why-we-published-parler-users-videos-capitol-attack"&gt;accompanying writeup&lt;/a&gt;, ProPublica outlines how it ended up with the over 500 videos contained in the resource. It says it originally got the videos from an anonymous programmer who archived over 1 million clips from Parler before it went offline. ProPublica then pulled out around 2,500 videos based on the time they were uploaded and their location data. From these, its staff selected over 500 videos which they believed to be newsworthy and relevant to the day’s events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wm4FG"&gt;Despite the amount of videos contained in the resource, ProPublica notes that there are some notable blindspots. For example, it only has one video from inside the Senate or House chambers, despite media footage that suggests rioters were filming inside the rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung heir ordered back to prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Heir Jay Y. Lee Appears At Court For Corruption Retrial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EY9ohZhFbLzNeMpHug3bjACozXw=/0x1:3851x2568/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68683476/1284664365.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jay Y. Lee arrives at the Seoul High Court on November 09, 2020 in Seoul, South Korea | Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6D1iZ"&gt;Lee Jae-yong — known as Jay Y. Lee in the West — the de facto leader and heir to the Samsung Group conglomerate, has been ordered back to prison for two years and six months on bribery charges, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-18/samsung-s-billionaire-heir-ordered-back-to-prison-for-bribery"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zKWGN"&gt;The billionaire son of controversial Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21532544/samsung-chairman-lee-kun-hee-dies-78"&gt;died in October&lt;/a&gt;, was first jailed in 2017 in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14867124/samsung-bribery-corruption-trial-chairman-lee-jae-yong"&gt;succession scandal&lt;/a&gt; that saw the removal of president Park Geun-hye. Lee served just one year of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16201360/samsung-lee-jae-yong-guilty"&gt;five-year sentence&lt;/a&gt; before a retrial was ordered in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vz1wrF"&gt;Lee had been accused of offering horses and other bribes to a friend of the former president to win government support for his succession at Samsung. Park is serving a 20-year sentence on a variety of charges including bribery related to Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="N0VBWR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung, corruption, and you","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14867124/samsung-bribery-corruption-trial-chairman-lee-jae-yong"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zWJnAz"&gt;In December, Lee offered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249040/jay-y-lee-apology-samsung-heir-bribery"&gt;rare public apology&lt;/a&gt; for his role in the succession plot. He also pledged that he would not pass management control of the Korean dynasty to his children. Lee Jae-yong, 52, is the grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1dVAJ"&gt;The ruling is expected to create a leadership vacuum at the top of the conglomerate, potentially complicating major strategic decisions. Samsung is currently run by a team of senior executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLFNI3"&gt;An attorney for Lee called the decision “regrettable,” according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmfmUx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin’s rocket reaches orbit for the first time, deploys satellites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_jlhdjIT6xgoQagmIzdn8u2fs4=/251x0:2816x1710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68681015/Virgin_Orbit_87.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s airborne rocket-launching system during a previous test.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Orbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9HVGW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th 5:34PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s rocket &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit/status/1350933162398986240"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reached orbit and the satellites were released&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, meaning Sunday’s mission was a success. The headline has been updated to reflect this. The original story is below. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNSIl2"&gt;Virgin Orbit — the sister company of billionaire Richard Branson’s space tourism outfit Virgin Galactic — will try a second test of its small satellite-launching rocket later today, months after it failed to reach orbit during a first attempt. It will also be the first time that the company tries to launch working satellites into space on behalf of NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2r69S"&gt;Sometime after 1PM ET, Virgin Orbit’s customized Boeing 747 will take off from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceport in the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; and ascend to 35,000 feet with the satellite-launching rocket attached to its wing. Once it reaches a predetermined location, the rocket is supposed to drop and ignite, taking the small satellites on board the rest of the way into orbit around the Earth. Virgin Orbit says the window for launch will last until 5PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M56MhT"&gt;Virgin Orbit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgin_orbit/status/1350839742900760576?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Sunday morning that it’s aiming for takeoff at 10:30AM PT (1:30PM ET). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RIgARp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With operations for our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaunchDemo2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LaunchDemo2&lt;/a&gt; mission already in full swing, it's an exciting morning here at Mojave Air and Space Port! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOX loading on the rocket has begun, and we're looking good to hit our target takeoff time of approximately 10:30 AM Pacific. &lt;a href="https://t.co/naBppEJRhD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/naBppEJRhD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Virgin Orbit (@Virgin_Orbit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit/status/1350839742900760576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XfUnKC"&gt;There is no live stream of the test, though the company plans to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virgin_Orbit"&gt;tweet updates&lt;/a&gt; throughout the flight. It will make photos and video available sometime after the test is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iR3DqF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Virgin Orbit has been working on its airborne rocket-launching system for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqBZLu"&gt;Virgin Orbit has spent years developing this method of airborne rocket-launching, and it has performed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20687873/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-drop-test-cosmic-girl-747-california"&gt;increasingly complex&lt;/a&gt; flight tests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102556/virgin-orbit-launcherone-cosmic-girl-captive-carry-test-flight"&gt;since 2018&lt;/a&gt;. But the first full test of the company’s rocket-launching capabilities in May of last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/25/21265057/virgin-orbit-launcherone-rocket-test-launch-747-airplane-cosmic-girl"&gt;did not go completely as planned&lt;/a&gt;. The plane ascended correctly, the rocket dropped, and the main engine ignited. But a problem in the liquid oxygen fuel line prevented the rocket from reaching orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiSZhY"&gt;Dan Hart, Virgin Orbit’s CEO, said during a conference call earlier this month that the company has made changes to those propellant lines and done an “enormous amount of testing” since May, despite the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlgvXv"&gt;“Watching [Virgin Orbit] rise to the occasion and dive into the details and drive the maturation of the system, and doing it in a pandemic environment, is really amazing to watch,” Hart said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTNrbq"&gt;Technical fixes aside, another difference between the previous test and this one is that Virgin Orbit will be attempting to deliver real commercial payloads for a customer for the first time: NASA. The space agency has tasked Virgin Orbit with carrying 10 different small satellites for various universities. Each will perform a variety of missions, from cleaning up space debris, to practicing inspection and maintenance of other spacecraft, to making weather observations. A &lt;a href="https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/announcing-the-window-for-launch-demo-2/"&gt;full list is available on Virgin Orbit’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0xash"&gt;This mission was supposed to take place back in December, but was delayed because some members of Virgin Orbit’s launch team had to quarantine. Hart said Virgin Orbit has “done a huge amount to ensure the safety of the team” ahead of today’s launch. A big part of that is having people work remotely, but for those who have to be on site,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hart said Virgin Orbit is enforcing social distancing, making employees use PPE, disinfecting spaces, and installing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;air purifiers. “Every single tool that you can imagine that is out there in industry, we have applied, but we have a team that’s eager, that’s focused,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3ISwL"&gt;The launch attempt was rescheduled to earlier this month, though that has slipped a few times now to today’s window. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgin_orbit/status/1350519343147204609?s=21"&gt;tweeted on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that the hardware is “in great shape” and that the weather looks favorable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tk0tVC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="On board Virgin Orbit’s flying launchpad|63519" data-volume-uuid="d897fadf8" data-volume-id="63519" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-510" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtHlgR"&gt;Virgin Orbit’s approach to launching satellites is quite different from that of SpaceX or the other major launch providers that NASA and others typically use. But it’s one that the company believes will help take a bite out of the burgeoning small satellite market. By launching from a plane in the air, Virgin Orbit’s system doesn’t need as big a rocket, or as much fuel, which helps keep costs down. The company argues that this is a potentially more flexible system, since it makes satellite launches theoretically possible from anywhere a 747 can take off and land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQzGUM"&gt;(Those reasons may be why Virgin Orbit has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16648336/virgin-orbit-launcherone-defense-department-cosmic-girl"&gt;inked a contract with the Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;. Virgin Orbit wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906657/virgin-orbit-mars-vehicle-deep-space-satellite-missions-launcherone-satrevolution"&gt;to launch missions to Mars, too&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myTb7I"&gt;But first Virgin Orbit must prove that the system works, and that the company can be profitable. Backers like Branson and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, have sustained it through development so far. The company is now seeking &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-bransons-virgin-orbit-seeks-1-billion-valuation-in-fundraising-11602403201"&gt;up to $200 million in new funding&lt;/a&gt; after spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing the airborne launch system it will test again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aR6nFH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The goal is to become a dedicated launcher for the budding small satellite market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBhNec"&gt;Hart stressed on the call that this is a test flight, and that the company will be “thrilled to get the data” that’s generated along the way so it can continue developing and refining the launch system. He also said the Virgin Orbit team is “mindful that there’s risk on whether we will get to the final orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQciFc"&gt;But Hart said Virgin Orbit has been “working vigorously and looking at all the details and making sure that we have the best shot possible to get to orbit” considering there are real satellites on board this time. That work has included help from an investigation team made up of people from launch partner NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force, and industry professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sG29gH"&gt;“We really immersed our engineering team with a fresh set of eyes to make sure that basically that we weren’t drinking our own bathwater,” Hart said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79tYJm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 17th, 11:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds updated takeoff time of 1:30PM ET and new tweet from Virgin Orbit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler resurfaces on Sunday with an updated timeframe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUhsNL-ZXo_deKW4rxxasFnqnh4=/0x0:3234x2156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68682223/1230527974.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="message—notice"&gt;Social media platform Parler was all but wiped off the internet last week, but on Sunday, showed some signs of life. A message from Parler CEO John Matze, first noted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1350799549959458817"&gt;CNN’s Donie O’Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, is now appearing at the &lt;a href="https://parler.com/"&gt;site’s URL&lt;/a&gt; with an image showing a “technical difficulties” banner, and a message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zbp2x"&gt;“Now seems like the right time to remind you all — both lovers and haters — why we started this platform. We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media,” the message reads, pledging to “welcome all of you back soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtEsS1"&gt;Matze said that Parler could return within weeks. “I’m confident that by the end of the month, we’ll be back up,” &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/parler-ceo-confident-platform-will-return-by-months-end-after-weekend-of-positive-developments"&gt;Matze told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday night. That’s a major shift from Wednesday when Matze told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that Parler &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-parler/exclusive-parler-ceo-says-social-media-app-favored-by-trump-supporters-may-not-return-idUSL1N2JO34Z"&gt;might never return&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jomKZX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon dropped Parler from its web services&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, saying in a letter it “cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others.” &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/fast-thinking-how-the-capitol-riot-was-coordinated-online/"&gt;Parler was identified as a site &lt;/a&gt;where people who participated in the deadly January 6th assault on the Capitol had planned the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTrCM1"&gt;The site is now hosted by Epik, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/17/tech/parler-back-online/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_term=link&amp;amp;utm_content=2021-01-17T21%3A11%3A43&amp;amp;utm_source=twcnnbrk"&gt;as CNN notes&lt;/a&gt;, a hosting company that also supports far-right sites such as Gab and 8chan. Amazon’s suspension &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=parler+apple+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS779US780&amp;amp;oq=parler+apple+site%3Atheverge.com&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5302j0j9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;followed Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google removing&lt;/a&gt; Parler’s app from their respective app stores. Matze said even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;Parler’s lawyers had cut ties.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uqoKu"&gt;Parler sued Amazon for cutting off its hosting, and in a response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;Amazon detailed some of the graphic, violent threats&lt;/a&gt; posted to the site that led to its removal, including posts that called for shooting police officers, killing Black and Jewish people, and assassinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Apa1"&gt;Parler launched in 2018, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;user numbers soared&lt;/a&gt; after Election Day in the US, as other social platforms tightened their moderation policies. Parler’s its less-strict moderation policies were a draw for many new users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kasKwB"&gt;Parler may have a tough road back to its former state, however, after researchers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;archived 99 percent of its posts&lt;/a&gt;, scraping videos and other data, some with GPS info. That archive was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231749/parler-interactive-map-video-gps-capitol-attack"&gt;used to create an interactive map&lt;/a&gt; of the attack on the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHZq76"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 16th, 4:55AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Matze quote suggesting Parler could return by the  end of January. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2swo52"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Cherry, Clarice, The United States vs. Billie Holiday, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6721JVRv2U_8oMQrdhVFJY4a5EI=/37x0:1252x810/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68682158/billie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Andra Day stars in &lt;em&gt;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USi-ppCfxEA&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=Hulu" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axNlSi"&gt;I’m getting to the point where there’s so much to stream that I don’t know what to watch first, old shows I want to catch up on, or new shows/movies so I can keep up with all the references on Twitter. But! I am filled with hope for the coming weeks, as there are a slew of interesting-looking trailers for movies I have been waiting to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6E0eq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/USi-ppCfxEA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rMs8tY"&gt;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mXMImx"&gt;I sort of wish this movie had been named “Strange Fruit” after Holiday’s 1939 song that drew the ire of the FBI, but guessing a lot of people don’t know about this part of Holiday’s life. The great jazz singer who struggled with drug addiction saw the government wreck her career using an undercover sting operation, all over a controversial song. Really looking forward to watching this. Directed by Lee Daniels,&lt;em&gt; The United States vs. Billie Holiday&lt;/em&gt; stars Andra Day, and premieres February 26th on Hulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWcEG8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfMHiNFOAis?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SBn3qR"&gt;Clarice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oP5wzG"&gt;Do we really need another show about a brilliant but troubled detective/agent who pursues terrible serial killers and solves graphic murders (usually of women)? Apparently CBS thinks we do, because it’s giving us &lt;em&gt;Clarice&lt;/em&gt;, a series about the rookie FBI agent from &lt;em&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/em&gt; that “takes a deep dive into her untold personal story.” See, she has to hunt serial killers &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; deal with the Washington DC bureaucracy! Most of this trailer shows people in authority being rude and/or dismissive to Clarice, which doesn’t really track; for example, the dick bureaucrat who tells her “we do &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt;, not at the full moon” obviously never saw the movie. If you can’t get enough of moody procedural crime drama, &lt;em&gt;Clarice&lt;/em&gt; hits CBS and CBS All Access February 11th. I’ll check out the pilot, but if they keep up with this spooky version of the song “Country Roads” we hear in the trailer, I might not last long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yY8O5M"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENv0B-jX3O4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vhcEZP"&gt;Breaking News in Yuba County&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5sZNFQ"&gt;Allison Janney stars in this dark comedy/mystery about a woman who says her husband has been kidnapped, and enjoys the sudden celebrity that goes along with the news. Of course, things are not quite as they seem! The all-star cast includes Mila Kunis, Awkwafina, Juliette Lewis, Jimmi Simpson, Wanda Sykes, Ellen Barkin, Samira Wiley, and Matthew Modine. &lt;em&gt;Breaking News in Yuba County&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Tate Taylor and lands in select theaters February 12th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="syHJmp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H5bH6O0bErk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Fhvf5O"&gt;Cherry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Dhew9c"&gt;Glad that they fixed the &lt;a href="https://movieweb.com/cherry-poster-changed-tom-holland/"&gt;weird first poster&lt;/a&gt; for this movie, which stars Tom Holland as a veteran with PTSD who is addicted to opioids and robs banks to support his habit. It’s a little tough to reconcile Holland’s baby face with the movie’s dark plot, but there is much buzz about this flick, and about Holland’s performance. Based on a novel by Nico Walker, &lt;em&gt;Cherry&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Joe and Anthony Russo and hits theaters Feburary 26th and Apple TV Plus on March 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ywhQki"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ivHf4ODMi4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L3iOto"&gt;Judas and The Black Messiah&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cbNRVp"&gt;This is the second trailer for this highly anticipated movie about the life and assassination of Black Panther party leader Fred Hampton, starring Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton, and LaKeith Stanfield as William O’Neal, the FBI informant who betrayed him. &lt;em&gt;Judas and The Black Messiah&lt;/em&gt; debuts on HBO Max and in theaters February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CQj76"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
