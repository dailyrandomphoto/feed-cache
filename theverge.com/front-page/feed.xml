    <title>Uber partners with ScriptDrop for prescription delivery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k5dTzv"&gt;Pharmacies using prescription delivery service ScriptDrop will deliver medications to customers through Uber, the company announced today. Uber will be the default delivery service for ScriptDrop pharmacies in 37 states and will eventually expand to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEQixf"&gt;The service lets pharmacies offer prescription deliveries for patients. The tool can integrate with whatever organizational software the pharmacies normally use to keep track of prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksLo6G"&gt;“Being able to combine ScriptDrop’s integrated interface with Uber’s technology means that pharmacies of all sizes will be better equipped to improve prescription adherence and serve the most vulnerable of their communities,” Amanda Epp, ScriptDrop CEO, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq9GKO"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mail-order-drug-delivery-rises-during-coronavirus-lockdowns-11589281203"&gt;fueled a rise&lt;/a&gt; in mail-order and courier-based drug deliveries, as people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;avoided&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in-person trips to the pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3OP4P"&gt;This is Uber’s second foray into prescription delivery. It partnered with NimbleRx to deliver drugs in Seattle and Dallas &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fuber-health-expands-to-include-prescription-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F24%2F22346330%2Fuber-perscription-delivery-scriptdrop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It then &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128006020/en/Uber-Eats-Announces-Prescription-Delivery-in-NYC-with-Nimble"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; that service to Austin, Houston, and New York City. The company has other health care functions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17061862/uber-health-non-emergency-medical-transportation-hipaa"&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; that lets doctors or other providers book rides for patients to and from appointments. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google rubs it in with new Photos collection of all the pints you once enjoyed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Barnimer Brauhaus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKxGX3H0O7VdG1wYlewaTXV6EGM=/0x53:4452x3021/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018245/1231526002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="28aNU5"&gt;You know what I haven’t seen in more than a year? The inside of a pub. Or a bar. Or, indeed, any kind of inn, hostelry, saloon, roadhouse, taproom, tavern, or beer hall where money can be exchanged for the sweet relief of drink. Google, though, hasn’t forgotten and has apparently decided to taunt me with a new tag in its Photo app dedicated to the stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi5PX0"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/24/google-photos-pours-the-beers-in-new-cheers-memories-collection/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if you open up the Google Photos app right now, it should have a new Memories collection at the top of the screen. These are thematic groupings of photos selected by machine learning, and while previous collections have focused on children or food, this one — appropriately titled “Cheers!” — is dedicated to booze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Onws6V"&gt;Click the image, and you’ll be shown a bittersweet slideshow: pictures of drinks being drunk with friends and loved ones. To paraphrase &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;’s famous &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/suRDUFpsHus"&gt;Carousel scene&lt;/a&gt;, here is the essence of nostalgia, taking us to a place where we ache to go again. The pub. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAkkZlfXC1T6LkM4uKfeeofvG7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394179/google_cheers_category.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photos by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A sampling from the Cheers! collection in Google Photos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tRGKAB"&gt;A tiny caveat: when &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers looked for the “Cheers!” collection in their own app, not everyone found it. And those who did noted that the software didn’t always pick up on all of the relevant pictures of pitchers. (Maybe it’s a fussy drinker? Can’t relate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TFxWf"&gt;At any rate, it’s another neat demonstration of the power of Google’s machine learning photo tools as well as a cruel reminder of what most of us are currently missing. And please, if you’re in a country where pubs and bars are currently open, where you can simply walk out the door and grab yourself a pint in the sunshine, I &lt;em&gt;beg&lt;/em&gt; of you: shut up and don’t talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to write special characters on Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sS-LrvGE5QPG1pL_bM9oGK4x_gg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018184/akrales_191112_3778_0249.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nBtPSS"&gt;Here’s the situation: you’re typing a report for work, and you suddenly have to write the phrase “Jones née Berkowitz.” Or you are adding a phrase in Spanish and need to use the word “años.” How do you add the special characters to the letters? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JFT5W"&gt;Special characters (also known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"&gt;diacritical marks&lt;/a&gt;) may be more common in certain languages, but there are plenty of circumstances in which English speakers may need to use them. But because they are so rare in English, native English speakers may not have learned how to add those marks to documents, emails, or other writings on their Macs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRZX20"&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvDkQ8"&gt;For access to more common diacritical marks, you just need to hold down the key for the letter you want to use until a small numbered menu appears on-screen. The menu that pops up will show all of the diacritical marks available for that letter; just type the correct number, and the letter with the mark will appear on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you hold down the “e” key, all the available diacritical marks will appear with numbers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQylY49xNLKgOD77bi_a9SHOtIw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392479/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_4.23.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you hold down the “e” key, all of the available diacritical marks will appear with numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y5DuVs"&gt;Use the Keyboard Viewer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eRdvwX"&gt;There are a number of other special characters that you may want to use, which you can access by pressing down the Option key on your Mac’s keyboard and then pressing the appropriate key. Not sure which key is the appropriate one? There is a Keyboard Viewer that will let you see all of the variations that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAK98V"&gt;It’s simple to find the Keyboard Viewer — if you’ve got the icon for the Input Menu in your menu bar. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The icon for the Input Menu appears in the upper right menu bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dYD2r3F68kc5r3DlgYMYxZG2Xks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394003/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_10.14.19_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The icon for the Input Menu appears in the upper right menu bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xQcvxq"&gt;Don’t see it? Here’s how to get it into your menu bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl7NKj"&gt;Go to Apple menu &amp;gt; System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard. Click on the Input Sources tab and look for the checkbox labeled “Show Input menu in menu bar.” If it’s not checked, then check it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To get the Input Menu icon, you need to enable it in your Keyboard preferences." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WiCbL_Acqn_3IwZTqEaWlHnPrTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394067/Screen_Shot_2021_03_23_at_4.35.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To get the Input Menu icon, you need to enable it in your Keyboard preferences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zxijHT"&gt;Click on the Input Menu icon (which will now be on the right side of your menu bar). Select “Show Keyboard Viewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0bhP9"&gt;A visual of your keyboard will appear on your screen. If you press on the Option key on your keyboard, the Keyboard Viewer will show you what special characters are available if you press those keys in combination with the Option key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Keyboard viewer will show you available special characters...." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sDlQg-Zuy5QhxzJYxkY86Nan_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394069/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_10.28.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Keyboard viewer will show special characters....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...if you press the Options key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ke4u73Kh3RR7SaCxIuql3Q6zJeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394073/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_10.28.23_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...if you press the Option key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhqUrG"&gt;Note: some of the keys will be outlined in orange. These are the keys we mentioned earlier, the ones that have several special characters and can be held down to see the various characters that can be used with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7VgaE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Doc1o0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIe848"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdHJvu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LShx8f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg proposes limited 230 reforms ahead of congressional hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mark Zuckerberg Hearing In Congress" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcGItWvH8CEQZND-Ms84ODpHXkM=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69018054/1177753310.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Aurora Samperio / NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SlNHzI"&gt;Opening statements from &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20210325/111407/HHRG-117-IF16-Wstate-ZuckerbergM-20210325-U1.pdf"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20210325/111407/HHRG-117-IF16-Wstate-PichaiS-20210325-SD001.pdf"&gt;Sundar Pichai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20210325/111407/HHRG-117-IF16-Bio-DorseyJ-20210325.pdf"&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; have been published ahead of &lt;a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting"&gt;Thursday’s misinformation hearing in the House&lt;/a&gt; — and they show all three CEOs taking on an unusually sensitive issue for tech platforms. All three statements are worth reading, with Dorsey focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248903/twitter-birdwatch-fact-checking-misinformation"&gt;internal tools like Birdwatch&lt;/a&gt; and Pichai warning of the dangers of a full repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLAs3X"&gt;But the most detailed proposal came from Zuckerberg, who talked at length about his preferred changes to Section 230. Instead of repealing the law entirely — as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke"&gt;President Biden called for&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign — Zuckerberg’s proposal would make Section 230 conditional on companies maintaining a system to remove illegal content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6aldx"&gt;As Zuckerberg describes it in the letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mKS594"&gt;We believe Congress should consider making platforms’ intermediary liability protection for certain types of unlawful content conditional on companies’ ability to meet best practices to combat the spread of this content. Instead of being granted immunity, platforms should be required to demonstrate that they have systems in place for identifying unlawful content and removing it. Platforms should not be held liable if a particular piece of content evades its detection — that would be impractical for platforms with billions of posts per day — but they should be required to have adequate systems in place to address unlawful content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="8xOlOb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VUfyyh"&gt;The standards for retaining 230 protections could be set by a third party, Zuckerberg goes on to say, and would exclude demands around encryption and privacy “that deserve a hearing in their own right.” That distinguishes Zuckerberg’s proposal from previously introduced 230 bills like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21162983/congress-senate-earn-it-act-lindsey-graham-richard-blumenthal-section-230-encryption-bill-proposed"&gt;the EARN IT Act&lt;/a&gt;, which conditions protections on a long-sought encryption backdoor. Zuckerberg’s proposal is closer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21340737/section-230-pact-act-thune-schatz-big-tech-reform-hearing"&gt;the PACT Act&lt;/a&gt;, which conditions the protections on transparency disclosures and other measures but focuses less on the removal of illegal content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbn9WF"&gt;Broadly, it’s unusual for companies to propose rules for how they would like to be regulated, but it’s less unusual for Zuckerberg, who has previously written at length about favorable &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html"&gt;data portability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/2/19/21142478/facebook-regulation-content-moderation-singapore-pakistan"&gt;content moderation&lt;/a&gt; rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1jnXO"&gt;This is the most detailed proposal for Section 230 that Zuckerberg has yet put forward, and it’s one that would require few material changes for Facebook itself. Facebook already maintains significant systems for identifying and removing illegal or otherwise objectionable content. Still, the proposal might address some of the most urgent objections to Section 230, which often focus on smaller sites entirely dedicated to malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgU3mJ"&gt;The issue is particularly urgent for groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which struggle with websites that don’t scan or moderate for child abuse imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2am0Z2"&gt;“There are a lot of companies, especially some of the very large companies, that engage in really tremendous voluntary measures,” NCMEC’s Yiota Souras &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22302850/section-230-reform-internet-speech-moderation-platforms"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. “But there are a lot of companies that don’t, and there is no legal requirement for them to use any kind of detection or screening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olfJYJ"&gt;The hearing is scheduled to begin at 12PM ET on Thursday, March 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The electric bucket trucks are coming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrGRFEAOastUXsGEWqh2VbIIrE0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017826/Lion8_BucketTruck_Rendering_Background_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WTiJWM"&gt;We’ve seen electric pickup trucks, electric school buses, and even a few electric 18-wheelers. But where are the electric aerial work platform trucks, known colloquially as bucket trucks? Con Edison may have an answer. The energy utility for New York City, and one of the largest energy companies in the US, is teaming up with a Canadian manufacturer to add battery-powered bucket trucks to its fleet by 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnyCfP"&gt;ConEd’s fleet isn’t exactly enormous — the utility owns around 300 bucket trucks — but the company hopes to send a signal to manufacturers that the time has come to electrify these types of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tHLYSW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This represents an important step in Con Edison’s journey toward fleet electrification”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nj6AKs"&gt;“Medium- and heavy-duty trucks are more challenging to electrify than cars, but the purchase of our first all-electric bucket truck shows the market is real today and it will only accelerate from here,” ConEd CEO Tim Cawley said in a statement. “While initially small in scope, this represents an important step in Con Edison’s journey toward fleet electrification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8JBI1"&gt;ConEd is working with two Canadian manufacturers, Lion Electric and Posi-Plus, on the design and production of its electric truck. It will have a Lion8 all-electric chassis, which underpins a few of Lion’s electric vehicles, as well as a crane and cherry picker to help ConEd workers reach power lines and other elevated infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYG1yW"&gt;The vehicle is scheduled for delivery in early 2022, which will be followed by its use in a pilot program. If successful, ConEd says the bucket truck will be integrated as part of its fleet of trucks that maintains the overhead electric system in both New York City and Westchester County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvdEA1"&gt;The class 8 truck will get an estimated 130 miles on a single charge. The battery will take eight hours to recharge when plugged into two AC Level 2 chargers, ConEd said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfR9nn"&gt;ConEd has been working to eliminate the emissions from its fleet before this announcement. As of last year, every new light-duty vehicle that the company buys is a plug-in hybrid or electric. The company said it is exploring a range of technologies to reduce its fossil fuel use in medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, and it may add more all-electric bucket trucks to its fleet in the future. Though it wouldn’t say when it plans to completely phase out fossil fuel-burning vehicles from its fleet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Astro City Mini is an awesome blast through Sega’s arcade past</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;And it’s coming to the US this week&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vziScL"&gt;Sega’s latest retro gaming machine, the Astro City Mini, comes on the back of two very different products: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20861085/sega-genesis-console-retro-mini-review-launch-games"&gt;excellent, crowd-pleasing Genesis Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519010/sega-game-gear-micro-review"&gt;baffling but adorable Game Gear Micro&lt;/a&gt;. The former was an obvious mainstream play, the latter a full-blown swing for esoterica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqpUf9"&gt;The Astro City Mini manages to straddle both approaches. An all-in-one miniature re-creation of a specific type of arcade cabinet with 37 games preloaded, it probably wasn’t on many people’s retro console bingo cards. But the finished product is very well-executed and should be considered essential for Sega fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qF9Jvb"&gt;I got my Astro City Mini a few months ago when it was released here in Japan. I kept meaning to write about it, but I always found excuses to delve further into its catalog first. Well, now’s the time. Limited Run Games just announced that it’ll be &lt;a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/astro-city-mini"&gt;selling&lt;/a&gt;, well, a limited run of the system for the US with localized packaging. Just 3,500 units will go on sale on Friday for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t8U03N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10409543"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4hJ3el"&gt;Unlike the various consoles that have recently been re-created in miniature form, the Astro City wasn’t a specific system that anyone ever designed games for. It was a cabinet that Sega sold with the intention of letting arcade proprietors fit with various game boards, and it turned out to be one of the most popular and iconic cabinets ever produced. You can still find units today in many Japanese arcades playing host to any number of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHLp2V"&gt;That meant Sega had a lot of freedom when it came to choosing which titles to include on the Astro City Mini. Ultimately, it settled on 37 games that represent an idiosyncratic, diverse selection of the company’s arcade history, from big hitters like &lt;em&gt;Virtua Fighter&lt;/em&gt; to lesser-known titles like &lt;em&gt;Dark Edge&lt;/em&gt; that have never received home releases before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLvhVT"&gt;The Mini hardware is chunky and solid, with Sega’s typical attention to detail. You can even buy a &lt;a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/astro-city-mini-style-kit"&gt;$39.99 “style kit”&lt;/a&gt; that includes a customizable marquee, a little stool, and a riser with a coin slot so that it can be used as a money bank. If there’s one thing Sega has been very good at lately (other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255880/yakuza-series-xbox-game-pass-where-to-start"&gt;pumping out &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;), it’s crafting cute replicas from its hardware heyday. The Astro City Mini is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7gYhC"&gt;There are a couple of quirks, however. For some reason, Sega saw fit to use a 16:9 display even though none of the games run in widescreen; most of them are 4:3, and some are vertically oriented shooters. The only content that actually fills the screen is the main menus. You can fill in the pillarboxes with some themed borders, but the choice of panel feels like a big compromise. There’s clearly space for a 4:3 screen here, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/7/17830868/neo-geo-mini-review-arcade-imperfect"&gt;SNK’s similar but much smaller Neo Geo Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a decent 4:3 panel with more vertical height than what you get on the Astro City Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9Xw_1aeOgulIAyzIcXZ2ZP6pdc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393644/DSCF7686.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LjzKuO"&gt;The Neo Geo Mini had terrible HDMI output, however, while the Astro City Mini looks far better on a TV screen. The image quality is much cleaner, and you do at least get some benefit from the wider menus, which let you shuffle through some screenshots and read some basic information about each game before launching it. (I’ll note here that while most of the games on the Astro City Mini are in Japanese, the text in most of them is fairly minimal, and the system menus can be fully switched to English.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6S0KJ"&gt;One element that the Astro City Mini does, unfortunately, share with the Neo Geo Mini is its lack of built-in battery, which is a bummer for a system with its own screen. It’d be a lot more convenient and practical if you could use it without tethering it to a wall or a USB battery pack. The situation is actually worse than with the Neo Geo Mini because Sega decided to go with Micro USB instead of USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scMdE7"&gt;But there is one area where the Astro City Mini obliterates the Neo Geo Mini, and it’s far more important to the overall success of the product: the built-in controls are fantastic. While SNK inexplicably used an analog-style stick for its 2D arcade cabinet, Sega has outfitted the Astro City Mini with a small but gloriously clicky stick along with hyper-responsive, tactile buttons. It feels like a high-quality arcade stick that’s been hit with a shrink ray, and in combination with the riser, it instantly elevates the Astro City Mini from “fun desk toy” to “legitimately good way to play these games.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fru5fkhIP4zSCHy2PTrxCiV00n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393645/DSCF7689.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6PxC4C"&gt;If you plan to play the Astro City Mini mostly on your TV, you might want to pick up a &lt;a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/astro-city-mini-gamepad"&gt;$27.99 extra controller&lt;/a&gt; — not least because the regular USB pads I tried didn’t work. Fortunately, the Astro City-themed ones that Sega designed are very good, with a smooth, circular D-pad and an arcade-style six-button layout. There’s also a full-size Astro City arcade stick that Sega released in Japan, though Limited Run Games isn’t selling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vj2UC7"&gt;The Astro City Mini’s game selection isn’t necessarily what I was expecting, not least because most of the titles were released before the cabinet actually made its debut in 1993. The oldest game here is &lt;em&gt;Flicky&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in 1984 on Sega’s System 1 board, and the newest is 1994’s &lt;em&gt;Puyo Puyo 2&lt;/em&gt; for the C2. Other than 1993’s polygonal &lt;em&gt;Virtua Fighter&lt;/em&gt;, the lineup can basically be seen as a well-curated journey through Sega’s pre-3D arcade history. There are notable omissions like &lt;em&gt;OutRun&lt;/em&gt;, though that probably has as much to do with the stick-based control scheme as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfYGiL"&gt;All of the games included are the original arcade versions rather than the generally inferior ports seen on the Master System and Genesis. That means that, unlike most re-releases, you’re getting canonical versions of big Sega games like &lt;em&gt;Space Harrier&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fantasy Zone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shinobi&lt;/em&gt;, and more. The emulation generally seems to be good. The only game that stood out to me otherwise was &lt;em&gt;Virtua Fighter&lt;/em&gt;, which has a little lag and runs at a higher resolution than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DhSS218X-YuYUtEgWGogDc3Pd5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22393646/DSCF7687.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MkeHMr"&gt;For me, the main selling point of the Astro City Mini is the games that got limited or nonexistent home releases. &lt;em&gt;Dark Edge&lt;/em&gt; is a boundary-pushing pre-polygon proto-3D fighting game that looks and plays like nothing else. &lt;em&gt;Cotton&lt;/em&gt; is a great scrolling shooter that only came out on the TurboGrafx-CD and the Neo Geo Pocket Color in the West. &lt;em&gt;Arabian Fight&lt;/em&gt; is a technically impressive beat-em-up that never left the arcades. &lt;em&gt;Rad Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is Sega’s first 32-bit game and the first to feature Sonic the Hedgehog (albeit as a toy dangling from your car’s mirror), but its only home release was for the Sega Saturn and never left Japan. &lt;em&gt;The Revenge of Death Adder&lt;/em&gt; is the most advanced entry in the Golden Axe series, yet it was arcade-exclusive until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvSWUG"&gt;The Astro City Mini’s lineup isn’t comprehensive, but it never really could have been. It’s easy to wonder about titles that were left out. If &lt;em&gt;Virtua Fighter&lt;/em&gt; made it on, why not &lt;em&gt;Virtua Racing&lt;/em&gt;, for example? And were three &lt;em&gt;Columns&lt;/em&gt; games really necessary? What’s here, though, is a strong collection that combines major names with deep cuts and should keep any fan of arcade games occupied for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h0xK5C"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0X_mqo0fgl4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="whCup4"&gt;The Astro City Mini is an odd, niche product with some weird flaws, but I can’t help but love it. The games are great, and the hardware is fun to play with, which is ultimately what really matters. I think it lands in a nice middle ground between the nostalgic appeal of the Genesis Mini and the obscure charms of the Game Gear Micro, while making for a better coin bank than either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM1eH4"&gt;That’s why I’m glad it’s getting a US release, however low-key. If you’re a certain kind of Sega fan, or a fan of arcade gaming in general, you’ll want to pick one up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s your last chance to get Disney Plus at its current subscription price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="disney+" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MUe6gBPhJwzZWX69cplUchn5fEI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017720/disneyplus.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eeTYP1"&gt;You have just two days left to lock in Disney Plus at its current price. Beginning on March 26th, &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyPlus&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; subscribers based in the United States will have to pay $7.99 a month or $80 per year to access the robust library of movies and TV shows available on the streaming service. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165869/disney-price-hike-united-states-bundle"&gt;originally announced the pricing change&lt;/a&gt; in December of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUaxVj"&gt;The new pricing for Disney Plus is a $1 increase, while the &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707630/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which includes streaming access to Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus, will also be impacted, increasing from $12.99 per month to $13.99 per month for ad support, or from $18.99 per month to $19.99 per month for the plan with ad-free Hulu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBJNyN"&gt;This is the first time Disney Plus has received a price hike, but it’s not surprising as more content comes to the streaming service in the coming months and years. Yesterday, Disney announced that both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will simultaneously release on Disney Plus as $30 Premiere Access titles alongside their theatrical releases. This month, the streaming service also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;surpassed 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, less than a year and a half after the service launched. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside id="ryutGL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus","description":"$6.99 per month or $69.99 if you pay annually","label":"Subscribe","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyPlus&amp;amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KCUAdo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Pokémon Snap adds nighttime photography </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nun1fbOSOzNo7dAFfw9I6h8wEww=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017404/1615837328_d4d59d798fd2d99b27de4a5f878e540a.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J1oxg5"&gt;In the original &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;, players were strictly daytime photographers. The game, released in 1999 for Nintendo 64, was essentially a rail shooter, but in the photography sense; players drifted slowly throughout an area while trying to take as many good pictures as they could. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294077/pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-new-n64"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;keeps the original game’s spirit alive but with a few welcome tweaks — including the ability to revisit locations at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzaG6c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;is set in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302971/pokemon-snap-new-gameplay-footage-nintendo-switch"&gt;Lental region&lt;/a&gt;, where players have been enlisted by a local professor to help investigate “luminous” pokémon and photograph creatures in the area. Each picture you take is judged against a variety of standards on a one to four-star scale; once your trip is over, photos are broken down by their subject. Snapping a picture of a pokémon doing something normal — like, walking around for example — is likely to net you a low score. But if you manage to capture a pokémon doing something unexpected, or reacting to something in its environment, you’ll earn a higher rating. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rao5dSO4UCE-y4TYs32D1bjYtdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389778/1615837323_555e7ae35e65172ab1246f40c1e3d73f.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TbHZvk"&gt;Composition matters, too. Photos are judged by factors like a pokémon’s pose, the direction it’s facing, framing, and more. The game includes a “resnap” option, where players can edit their photos by zooming in, adjusting brightness or focal points, and adding filters. The better the pictures, the more points you’ll get toward research levels for that area, thus helping Professor Mirror’s work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2Hynm"&gt;During a recent live stream of the game shown to press, a Nintendo representative demonstrated how players will work their way through a typical level. Players can’t control the speed of their vehicle, but they can lure pokémon out, or into different poses, with fruit. Pokémon will sometimes hide in bushes and need a little encouragement to come out. If you capture their attention, they might react with delight or surprise. Revisiting the level at night will open up those possibilities further. In addition to possibly attracting different pokémon, some may exhibit a mysterious glow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxG8Wf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;has always been about the thrill of a good shot. Its latest iteration is no different. Players won’t know what pokémon they’ll run into in different levels, though that’s sort of the point. The game will feature upward of 200 pokémon, with different environments that will attract different species; you’re more likely to find water types at the beach, for example, but not exclusively. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpGJPSafjf01q7TzKIOJOHfDI_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22389780/1615837332_31d9dfe8fcfbe3a5a7d5cc48b4418685.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UnZTfM"&gt;The game is expected to feature more social options than the original, though Nintendo has yet to release more information on how those features will work. &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/em&gt;launches April 30th for Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Realme 8 Pro is a £279 phone with a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ubo6dDC2rRLGJ6oq7Zg8yLLVzc8=/234x0:2766x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69017408/realme_8_Pro_i.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Realme says the slogan printed on the rear panel glows in the dark.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Realme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rG6WfA"&gt;Officially launching in the UK today, the Realme 8 Pro is a budget device that’s one of the first to use the new Samsung ISOCELL HM2 108-megapixel sensor in its main camera. While similar high-res sensors have been more common in pricier phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, this chip is designed for lower-cost devices like the 8 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpxx9s"&gt;This 108-megapixel chip isn’t the same one used in the S21 Ultra or even last year’s S20 Ultra. It’s a smaller sensor — 1/1.52-inch versus 1/1.33-inch — with slightly smaller 0.7μm pixels. However, it uses the same binning approach to improve light-gathering abilities by combining neighboring pixels into a less noisy 12-megapixel image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mtIclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10409112"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k13i6x"&gt;The Realme 8 Pro offers a 6.4-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 720G processor with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 4,500mAh battery that supports 50W fast charging. The back of the device, which comes in blue and black variants, features some intense Realme branding with the company’s “Dare to Leap” slogan in large fluorescent lettering that — the company claims — glows in the dark. Realme also says the design will appeal to “a new generation of younger users,” which we’ll have to take its word for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1harqp"&gt;The 8 Pro will go on sale on March 31st in the UK for £279 (about $380).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvP5M2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE review: more prey than Predator</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Unfit to dethrone Asus’ Zephyrus G14&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SiIDDZ"&gt;Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is chasing after the hype that Asus built with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;last year’s excellent Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar in a few key ways: it’s a sophisticated-looking gaming laptop bordering on ultrabook territory in terms of its sleek and relatively thin design. It has a 14-inch 1080p display with a fast refresh rate and respectable graphics capabilities to top it off. Even its price hits a similar spot at $1,399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6zkWh"&gt;Asus’ latest G14 hasn’t made its way to us for review yet, so we don’t know exactly how it’ll compare to this one in all of the ways that matter. But in the meantime, Acer’s new model already has some clear advantages, like a built-in webcam and the Thunderbolt 4 port. It also achieves commendable gaming performance with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card, but don’t let the similarities (or even the few perks) trick you. Calling the new Triton 300 SE a Predator is a little bit of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L3Tknh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10408705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQfEYM"&gt;Last year’s G14 defied my colleague Monica Chin’s expectations for what a gaming laptop could achieve when it comes to battery life. Comparatively, Acer’s new laptop isn’t nearly as long-lasting, but it’s not terrible. The Triton 300 SE has a 60Wh four-cell battery that lasts around six hours on average with relatively light usage. More on this later, but safe to say it’s considerably less than the 10-hour battery life Acer claims. You can feel confident taking the Triton 300 SE out to a cafe to do some work for a few hours. But if you intend to be out all day, or use it to do any gaming, you’ll need to bring the charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An all-metal chassis meets a rather flimsy plastic lid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4uiIVLnm9V1-B1c1FkYrhNqprE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366606/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Triton 300 SE looks very sharp for a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vYH53O"&gt;Whether limited battery life bothers you or not, there are some other issues that I couldn’t help but notice. The interplay of all-plastic on the lid and an all-metal chassis looks fine, but the lid feels flimsy in a way that makes me concerned for its longevity. Applying just a few pounds of pressure to the Predator logo beneath the display makes it bow more than it should. On the unit that Acer sent us, the softer plastic built into the screen’s bezel that cushions the lid when it closes has tiny gaps where it’s not seamlessly adhered. And near the keyboard, the “Turbo” key that amps up the fans has a slight imperfection on it. Lastly, Acer stuffed &lt;em&gt;far &lt;/em&gt;too much annoying bloatware into the Triton. About every hour, there’s a pop-up asking me to install or subscribe to something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLXpfW"&gt;All of this makes for a laptop that doesn’t feel as high-end as its cost indicates it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6HQ8j"&gt;There’s just one configuration of this model right now, containing a four-core Intel Core i7-11375H processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, 512GB of NVMe SSD storage, as well as the aforementioned RTX 3060 graphics card. The performance of that GPU depends a lot on how much power each manufacturer wants to allow it to draw. And in this case, it has a 75W maximum power draw and can be boosted up to 1,382MHz. After spending time with several RTX 3070-equipped gaming laptops with more headroom than that, I wasn’t expecting much here. However, I was pleased to see gaming performance in multiple titles getting around 60 frames per second without requiring compromises in the settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ODnpn7hQK4qWQ1-eXOJGrlhqTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366601/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This photo highlights the color-shifting hinge as well as the display’s poor viewing angles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zM84qkWQm637K2k98o62Dkd6CRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366598/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viewed straight-on, the 14-inch 1080p 144Hz display looks fantastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTqtJ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, a system-intensive, open-world game, ran at an average of 60fps with ultra settings turned on. Testing Triton 300 SE’s RTX-enabled ray-tracing chops, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; on ultra settings with the ray-tracing shadows set to medium got 61 frames per second. Turning the ray-tracing setting up to ultra knocked it down to 48fps. Running that game with ray tracing set to ultra and Nvidia’s deep learning super sampling (DLSS) technique turned on that lowers the render resolution, then uses AI to upscale textures, Acer’s laptop achieved 55 frames per second, splitting the difference. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;, another demanding open-world game, ran at 53 frames per second on ultra settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="WJUU87"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10408809"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIww1C"&gt;It’s not surprising that, with its newer components, Acer’s laptop puts up more favorable numbers than the 2020 G14 that had an RTX 2060. Performance &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-series/spec"&gt;in some of Asus’ 2021 models&lt;/a&gt; could fare &lt;em&gt;slightly &lt;/em&gt;better in terms of 1080p performance, even though it similarly uses the RTX 3060. That’s because its graphics chip has a slightly higher 80W power ceiling compared to 75W in the Triton 300 SE, not to mention that its AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor has eight cores compared to the four cores with this 11th Gen Intel processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhek5O"&gt;The Triton 300 SE’s metal chassis effectively turns into a heatsink to dissipate heat under heavy use, and I noticed it getting warm during gameplay. Unlike most laptops, the heat extended all the way down to the wrist rest, but it wasn’t bothersome. I appreciate the thought that went into the cooling system, which takes air in through the back, then pushes it out the sides of the laptop. Some laptops do the inverse of this, and it can make actually using laptops on your lap a little too toasty, even for non-gaming-related tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUotwm"&gt;There’s a “Turbo” button located above the main batch of keys that overclocks the CPU and GPU, sending the fans loudly into overdrive. I didn’t need to use this mode to achieve the frame rates I cited earlier, and turning it on didn’t seem to make a huge difference during my testing. I also didn’t notice an appreciable difference using it with Adobe Premiere Pro to export a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video. It took 5 minutes and 40 seconds to run through the test. Considering the price and size of this machine, these results rank highly among other laptops we’ve tested recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHho7z"&gt;Acer uses a 14-inch 1080p IPS 16:9 aspect ratio panel with a 144Hz refresh rate with up to 300 nits of brightness. During general use and gameplay, I have no complaints about the color accuracy or brightness, though there’s some noticeable ghosting, likely attributed to a higher response time that adds latency. As a result, the mouse pointer doesn’t glide across the screen as smoothly as I’ve seen on other high refresh rate screens, and it extends to gameplay looking a little blurry at times, trivializing the technical achievement of hitting 60 frames per second in games, as well as having a 144Hz refresh rate in the first place. Despite multiple requests for a comment on the response time, Acer didn’t provide the spec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-1yJbJMt4WaJObvinZocpj9phE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366602/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I felt right at home on Acer’s keyboard layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdxhepQO46sf51KYN7WQdkWJ4cw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366603/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This fingerprint sensor worked about half the time for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTdi99"&gt;Additionally, this screen’s viewing angles are far more limited than I expect from an IPS panel. It’s easily viewable straight-on, but less so from other angles unless the brightness is amped up. Next to the less-than-stellar battery life, this is a big miss for Acer that might be less forgivable for gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrtDHs"&gt;I was right at home with Acer’s keyboard, though, both in terms of the layout and feel of the keys here. This keyboard has three-zone backlit keys (you can customize each zone to be a different color in its Predator software), and though many features require holding the “Fn” key to use, the layout is intuitive and doesn’t feel overly cramped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ2dOX"&gt;The glass trackpad supports all of the gestures I expect with Windows Precision drivers, but it isn’t as responsive to my touch as it should be. I think it’s more an issue with the screen’s response time than it is an issue with the trackpad. A fingerprint scanner you can use as an alternative to a PIN is embedded in the top-left corner of the trackpad, but I’ve found that it only works half the time. With that failure rate, I’d rather just have more trackpad real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kGPMhM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10408691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msGm1x"&gt;Acer included the essentials in terms of ports. There are two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports — one on each side, with the right-facing port being able to charge some devices. The star of the show is the Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port, which can be used to transfer data or connect a display. Additionally, I’m happy to see an HDMI 2.1 port, offering up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. There’s also a headphone combo jack and a DC-in port for its relatively compact 180W power brick. I wish Acer allowed this laptop to be recharged via USB-C, but it’s all handled through the proprietary DC charging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ne6Mgh6TuUgwDpOAIbsDsbJkUc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366605/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The left side features a fan exhaust, charging port, USB Type-A port, and a Thunderbolt 4 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hd4TgyzJZSlY6ufOgeDabHI9Iuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22366604/cfaulkner_210310_4466_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right, there’s another fan exhaust, HDMI 2.1 port, USB Type-A, and a headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6SxMdo"&gt;Coming back to battery life, it’s not the biggest flaw that this laptop can only get between five and six hours of battery life per charge while using apps like Microsoft Edge, Spotify, and Slack. The issue here is that Acer claims it will last up to 10 hours, but it doesn’t outwardly mention that you’ll only get that kind of longevity if you’re doing something very simple, like watching HD video with no other apps running. That’s fine if you’re on an airplane for hours on end, but most people rely on a laptop for more than that, so it’s far from the best method for judging battery performance. Based on my testing, the best results you should expect with light usage is about six hours at most. It’s not bad for a gaming laptop, but it keeps the Triton 300 SE from hanging with the battery performance you can get from other ultrabooks or even the Zephyrus G14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="h5edCU"&gt;It was daring of Acer to jump into the ring against Asus’ Zephyrus G14, a gaming laptop that ticks a lot of boxes (aside from the missing webcam) for the price. This is a more elegant-looking machine than the G14, and compared directly, it’s hard to not appreciate its Thunderbolt 4 port and a webcam. It’s also a capable performer with games. But Asus proved that a gaming laptop can be more than just a powerful machine. It can also have good battery life for portable use and competent build quality without a bunch of bloatware. The competition is fierce, but the Triton 300 SE is more like prey than a bonafide Predator.&lt;/p&gt;
