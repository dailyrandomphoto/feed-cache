    <title>The best floodlight camera to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lFwEZ-JVDdUwN2mLCZ9OsuxxM3c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239338/jtuohy_211011_4898_0003_resize.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These security cameras will shed some light on your smart home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="X5Ijoo"&gt;When something goes bump in the night in your backyard, you probably want to know about it. While security cameras with night vision can show you what’s out there, a floodlight camera can both show and tell that rascal or raccoon to get off your lawn, scaring them away with some powerful lumens and possibly a blaring siren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiHVPz"&gt;While there’s mixed research on whether outdoor lighting is a significant deterrent to crime or just potentially annoying for your neighbors, there are plenty of benefits to lighting up your property from both a safety and security perspective. With smart floodlight cameras you get the added value of better lighting in addition to a way to keep an eye on your home. Thanks to sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, smart floodlight cameras can be set to only light up when there’s someone there, instead of just when a gust of wind sends a plastic bag through your yard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8NHsV"&gt;I put six of the best floodlight cameras to the test to help you decide which is the right choice for your smart home. My top pick is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Floodlight-360-Degree-Weatherproof/dp/B0967TSRBM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy Floodlight Cam 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to its innovative features; an impressive 360 field-of-view; super bright, tunable LED floodlights; and lack of monthly fees. I also like the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf8d2S4YhfB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight&lt;/a&gt; for its excellent video quality, wide compatibility with smart home platforms (yes, even Apple HomeKit), and more svelte design, but you need to pay monthly for the best features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVxRgq"&gt;For those on a budget, the &lt;a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/482924/456723/8154?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2Fp%2FWYZE-Wired-Outdoor-Wi-Fi-Floodlight-Home-Security-Camera-WYZECFL%2F317038240&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestFloodlightCameras12321" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wyze Cam Floodlight&lt;/a&gt; is a solid choice with just a few concessions for a much lower price. Plus, it’s the only camera we tested that also lights up for any suspicious sound, not just motion. Read on to learn more, including which is the best option for an Alexa or Google Home smart home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="0uHpCS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901099"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="imYLkd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901124"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xOGAe5"&gt;Why to buy a floodlight security camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zJH1kv"&gt;Anyone considering installing security cameras outside their home should look at a floodlight camera first. These devices combine lights, a camera, and (in most cases) continuous power in one easy package. The motion-activated lights also provide a valuable safety feature, helping make sure you don’t trip on that package left in your driveway. Plus, most have built-in sirens you can activate as a deterrent to anyone creeping around your property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JQ1md"&gt;Floodlight security cameras are predominantly wired, which means they are hardwired to your electrical system, like a light fixture. They still operate wirelessly to transmit video using your home’s Wi-Fi. Some have a backup battery built-in, and one I tested (the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight camera) can be completely wireless, working just off battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUI6pX"&gt;The advantage of the hardwired option is there are no battery-charging woes. And, unlike with a plug-in camera, you don’t need to worry about drilling through your walls to access an indoor plug or putting the camera near an outdoor receptacle while snaking wiring down the side of your house. If you already have some sort of outdoor lighting, it’s a relatively easy swap to get a hardwired, always-on security camera plus light set up on the side of your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV0OA0"&gt;Floodlight cameras cost between $99 and $350 and, in general, come with the same camera technology as standard outdoor cameras. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/a&gt;, the Wyze Cam Floodlight, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight, and the Ring Floodlight Cam Pro all essentially take the companies’ flagship cameras and stick 2,000 to 3,000 lumens of motion-activated light on them. The camera is controlled in the same way and with the same features as the regular outdoor camera, but you get the added option of light control, which is what makes this an excellent upgrade to standard motion-activated lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLGWbv"&gt;That lighting control includes adjusting the brightness (handy if you have sensitive neighbors), length of time the lights stay on, what activates them, the option to have lights come on automatically at sunset and turn off at sunrise, and even integrate into smart home routines. Some models have lights that can be controlled individually with voice assistants such as Alexa, Google, and Siri, using their respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jrmkmQ"&gt;Why not to buy a floodlight security camera &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zurTsR"&gt;The downside to floodlight cameras is they’re significantly more expensive than their non-shiny siblings, generally $100 or so more. They’re also more limited in where you can place them; most need to be up high and where there is existing wiring for lighting (unless you are ready to spend a few extra hundred dollars on an electrician’s services). But that wiring provides continuous power, so once they’re up, you don’t have to mess with them. The same can’t always be said for battery-powered options.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaZKZa"&gt;Another consideration is that most floodlight cameras use non-replaceable LED lighting, so if the lights go bad, you’re left with a camera in the dark. A couple of models — Nest and Wyze have removable cameras — so if the lights do go out, you still have a camera you can use elsewhere. All of the models we tested have lights that should last between 50,000 and over 100,000 hours of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yM5rMn"&gt;How to install a floodlight security camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TRFNTV"&gt;Wiring for a floodlight camera is similar to any lighting fixture, with the addition of an outdoor junction box in some cases. I highly recommend employing an electrician, especially if you are at all uncomfortable fiddling with wiring anything while on the top of a ladder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4d2lBMnTI3ma1P3ODGcvuU08b2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055512/jtuohy_211011_4898_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installing a floodlight camera involves wiring and a ladder. While it can be a DIY project, it’s likely best suited to a licensed electrician.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iyovlb"&gt;The ideal place to install a floodlight camera is facing a yard, path, or driveway, placed up high — at least 6 to 10 feet — so the lights cover an ample space, and the camera has a good view. Make sure you have decent Wi-Fi in the area you want to install; if not, consider extending your Wi-Fi or upgrading to a mesh router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QszYBu"&gt;Before installing, download the manufacturer’s app and check the instructions. Some cameras need to be paired to the app before mounting them, which helps avoid too many trips up a ladder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOW0H2"&gt;Another thing to be aware of is which light switch in your home controls the camera. If you install it where there was previously a light, it will be controlled by a switch somewhere in your home. Handily, Wyze provides a bright purple sticker with its camera that you can affix to the switch, warning people not to turn it off. I wouldn’t recommend covering it with a flat plate or disabling it because it’s a helpful troubleshooting tool if you do run into any issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dd6OTc"&gt;The best floodlight cameras for 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id="ioV0Op"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10901075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="USAM6U"&gt;1. Eufy Floodlight Cam 2 Pro &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="liPByI"&gt;The best floodlight security camera for most people (if you can cope with that design)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="9cOJvp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901051" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8CWGsd"&gt;Eufy has gone for function over form with its beast of a floodlight camera that boasts a camera with a 360-degree field of view that pans and tilts to cover a vast area. This feature — plus its three adjustable, tunable lighting panels, individually addressable PIR motion sensors, and local storage — makes the Eufy Floodlight Cam 2 Pro our top pick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGiGU3"&gt;However, there are a few flaws, primarily how ugly it is. Then there’s the outdated push-to-talk two-way audio (we’d love some full-duplex here), a limited zoom, and no option for continuous video recording. Plus, smart alerts are limited to just people (no animals, vehicles, or packages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E50t4C"&gt;But if you want a hardwired camera that can see everything and lighting you can adjust to suit your needs, the Eufy is the best choice. Its 360-degree pan and tilt feature is well-thought-out, with subject lock and tracking that follows a person as they walk through your property. While you set the camera to a fixed point, it can detect motion outside of its view, thanks to PIR motion sensors in each floodlight panel, and will swivel the camera to catch it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40F2rb0_MLDAf2pYuvPWGV2Up-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055514/jtuohy_211011_4898_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eufy Floodlight Camera looks and works best when it’s tucked way up high, out of your line of sight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KI8fx7"&gt;The lack of smart alerts for animals, vehicles, and packages is annoying, but you can adjust the sensitivity of each motion sensor and set up activity zones to limit false alerts. Rich Notifications, which show a preview of the captured clip right in your phone’s notification tray, also helps cut down on how often you have to open the app to check in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7rKyH"&gt;A helpful auto-cruise feature lets you set four preset positions and have the camera auto-rotate through them on a set schedule or on demand. A Look Around button on the main page sends the camera into a surveillance spin for a quick check on your property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FnN88"&gt;The other neat feature is three lighting panels that deliver a blinding 3,000 lumens of light at up to 5,700 Kelvins — both of which are much higher than any competitor. At full brightness, it resembles the lighting of a prison yard, which is not great for most people. Thankfully, you can change the brightness and the color temperature from cool to warm. I set it to warm and 20 percent brightness, and it was more than bright enough without being harsh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Et7CQ"&gt;The 2K video quality is excellent, although the digital zoom is lacking (surprising with this image quality). The camera works over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, has a weather rating of IP65, includes standard and color night vision, and doesn’t require a Eufy hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5S1a7"&gt;There is 4GB of non-removable onboard storage (which gets you about 14 days’ worth of recordings with 45 activations a day). Or you can opt for a Network Attached Storage setup or use Eufy’s cloud service for $3 a month per camera. There is no 24/7 continuous video recording, and it works with Google Home and Alexa to stream footage on smart displays and control the camera’s lights in the app. You can’t stream footage in either Google or Amazon’s smartphone apps, however; you need to use the Eufy app for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DaRdyV"&gt;2. Arlo Pro 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mQxJXY"&gt;The best floodlight security camera for any smart home platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="n7EorW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901099" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HkoKMR"&gt;If you can’t get past the “mall surveillance” look of the Eufy, or you want something with a strong zoom, motion-activated siren, and better smart alerts, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight camera ($250) is my next favorite pick. It has by far the best video quality of any camera I tested and offers HDR imaging with its 2K resolution, which the Eufy doesn’t. The 12x digital zoom lets you get up close and personal with that rascally raccoon, and it has the option to auto-track and zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zx5R7F"&gt;You have to pay for zoom and track, however. In general, with Arlo, you need to subscribe to its Arlo Secure service (starting at $3 a month) to get any functionally out of its cameras. (I couldn’t even snooze motion alerts without a subscription plan.) But if you do pay, you get people, animal, vehicle, and package alerts, the option of continuous 24/7 recording (for an additional fee), and rich notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIXXGz"&gt;The Arlo is also the least obtrusive-looking floodlight camera — I will not go so far as to say it looks nice — but it’s not as large nor as prominent-looking as the rest (with the exception of the Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GcgpLA"&gt;As the Arlo can be battery-powered, you can mount it anywhere you need to (and add a solar panel for $60 to keep it juiced). But that does away with one of my favorite features of floodlight cams: reliable, continuous power. Arlo has the option of continuous power, but you need a nearby outlet and an additional purchase of a power cord (for $50). It does not mount to a standard outdoor junction box and isn’t a great drop-in upgrade for an existing non-camera floodlight. I’ve been testing the Arlo for six months on battery power, and I’ve had to charge it every two months. (It’s in a very busy location.) I would always opt for hardwired where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djwKa6"&gt;Despite the camera’s smaller size, the light is very bright and more than enough to light up my entire back patio. It’s one of only two cameras I tested that has the option to pulse its light to scare off intruders, and you can set its 80dB siren to go off on motion. (Be careful with this feature if you don’t want your neighbors to come knocking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM5pBn"&gt;One issue I ran into in my testing was that some water got into the floodlight after a heavy rainstorm. I was able to dry it out, and it’s been working fine since then, but I would recommend installing this, and any floodlight camera, under an eave or some covering where possible to extend the life. The Arlo app also took too long to pull up a live view at times, despite the camera being situated just a few yards from my internet router. In comparison, I didn’t have the same issues with the Eufy app — despite the camera being installed way out past my garage, hanging off the roof of my second story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L05PkB"&gt;Unlike some Arlo cameras, the Pro 3 Floodlight Camera doesn’t require an Arlo Hub, but it can be used with one to help with range and extend battery life. If you want the HomeKit compatibility it offers (one of only two cameras we tested that does), you will need that Hub, which costs $100. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide HomeKit Secure Video or the option of local storage on the Hub. There is just no way around that Arlo subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjER4Y"&gt;The Arlo Pro 3 does work with Google Home, and you can stream video in the app and on Nest smart displays. It also works with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and IFTTT, and you can control the light separately from the camera, which is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M7mB2Q"&gt;3. Wyze Cam Floodlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O2KiZL"&gt;The best cheap floodlight security camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="Jw7Qjq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901124" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Zr4Q"&gt;Wyze has come storming out of the gates with a superb floodlight camera that’s under half the price of the competition. This 2600 lumen blaster lit up the side of my house like an airport runway (it’s a harsh white, however). Moreover, unlike all the competition, the Wyze Cam Floodlight offers sound detection (Nest has it but only for smoke and CO alarms), very useful to highlight anyone trying to creep through the bushes while potentially out of range of any motion sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hllbBI"&gt;As with most of the cameras I tested, Wyze uses both a PIR and a camera-based motion sensor — which means the camera doesn’t have to be in the range of the motion for the lights to turn on. Wyze offers 270 degrees of motion sensing, which, along with Ring and Eufy, is the widest range of motion sensing on offer. The cherry on the top is that Wyze built an extra USB port into the device, so you can power a second Wyze Cam v3 (sold separately) and put it around the corner for an additional angle. This doesn’t get you quite the surveillance power of the Eufy, however, and does look a bit … cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QRGlp5S5YC3SUsEJW3bcB2QrgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23055526/jtuohy_211130_4898_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two cameras are better than one. With Wyze Floodlight Camera, you can connect a second Wyze Cam and leach off the power supply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W09KF1"&gt;Despite the low price, you’ll want to factor in paying for a Wyze CamPlus subscription plan (from $2 a month), as that’s how you’ll get smart alerts for people, packages, vehicles, and animals. Although 12 seconds of motion-recorded clips are free, there’s a 5-minute cooldown period between them where the camera won’t record anything, so unless you pay up for the unlimited length clips and no cooldown included in CamPlus, you could miss some vital action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrP97s"&gt;Zoom on the 1080p resolution Wyze is nowhere near as good as the Arlo’s, but the starlight sensor-powered night vision is superb. This uses any available light to illuminate a dark scene in color, and I could see more in that mode than with the floodlights turned on. The Wyze cam also has a louder siren than the Arlo, but both cameras can pulse the lights to scare off anything creeping around. As an added bonus, there’s the option of local storage by adding an SD card, which enables free, 24/7 continuous video recording — the only camera I tested that does this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea7NyN"&gt;As with all Wyze gear, smart home integration outside the Wyze ecosystem is limited. You can stream footage to Google and Alexa smart displays and have Alexa announce if motion is detected, but you can’t control the lights with either voice assistant, and you don’t get individual control of the floodlights outside of the Wyze app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2RQz7P"&gt;4. Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nwyAvH"&gt;The best floodlight camera that works with Amazon Alexa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="c6kk3E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901138" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45MQw7"&gt;Ring’s latest floodlight camera is essentially a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Pro 2 video doorbell&lt;/a&gt; camera mounted below high-powered, 2000-lumen adjustable lights. This is a good thing as the Ring Pro 2 is arguably Ring’s best camera yet. And while the Bird’s Eye View and 3D Motion Detection features that come with the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro had limited value in my testing, the quality of the 1080p resolution camera and its horizontal and vertical field of view means you get a really good vantage over your property. It’s much better coverage than the previous version making this worth the $70 price premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTWVzb"&gt;Ring’s digital zoom is also excellent, and the bumped-up siren is the loudest one we tested (at 110 dB). You can’t trigger the siren on motion, but there is the unique-to-Ring option to add an audible motion warning that tells prowlers they’re on camera — less offensive to the neighbors than a motion-triggered siren. I also like that this camera can be powered by a wall plug or traditional junction box wiring (a separate plug-in version is offered for $20 more), but I would always recommend hardwiring if you can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqpaPH"&gt;This floodlight cam is one of only two cameras we tested that has the option of 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and it comes in black if you prefer (as does the Arlo). There is no local storage, although Ring has said this camera will get compatibility with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Ring Alarm Pro that has a local storage option&lt;/a&gt;; however, you need to pay for a Ring Protect Plus plan to use that. Paying for a Ring plan (starting at $3 a month) adds person detection (no other smart alerts) and recorded videos — without it, it’s livestream only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKhG3F"&gt;While this is my top pick for Alexa users, because Ring as a whole integrates so well with its parent company’s smart home ecosystem, bizarrely, you can’t control the Ring’s floodlights through Alexa, either with voice or in Routines. You can view a live feed on Alexa-enabled displays, but you have to use the Ring app for all light control. Here, you can adjust three motion zones for the lights — handy so that your neighbor walking in his yard doesn’t turn them on. You can also put the lights on a schedule, adjust the brightness, and link Ring devices so that if a Ring camera on one side of the house detects motion it can turn on the floodlights on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt01vh"&gt;If you use a different smart home system from Alexa, give the Ring a pass, as it only works with Alexa. However, if you are just starting on your smart home journey, the Ring app is fast becoming a smart home platform of its own, especially if you add a Ring Alarm or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt; to your setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XlasdN"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Cam with Floodlight&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Z8OqfS"&gt;The best floodlight camera that works with Google Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="D9ARDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901148" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gvYXJK"&gt;There is a lot to like about Google’s new Nest Cam with floodlight. It has built-in battery backup for when the power goes out, free on-device recording (up to three hours), free smart alerts for people, animals, and vehicles, and the option of 24/7 recording (for a fee). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ku0Qrh"&gt;It’s also the only floodlight camera to offer facial recognition as part of Nest’s Familiar Faces feature. This means you can get an alert that says, “‘Sarah the Gardener’ is in the backyard” rather than the scarier “There’s a person in the backyard.” You need to pay for Nest Secure subscription service for this, which starts at $6 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hejhL"&gt;All these features are part of the camera that magnetically attaches to the two floodlights (a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt; that you can swap out if you like). But the lights also add some good options, including adjustable arms to angle your lighting, app and voice control in the Google Home app, ambient light activation, and the option to dim the beams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FvjUJ"&gt;But there is no built-in siren — the only camera in our roundup without the option of one — making it a poor choice for a dedicated security device. It does offer 5 GHz Wi-Fi, and the on-device machine learning makes for speedier notifications than most of the cameras we tested. Motion sensors in the floodlights provide a wide, 180-degree sensing range, ensuring the lights turn on when anything gets nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70kWEE"&gt;Sadly, as with all the new Nest devices, the camera only works with Google Home (and not even with the old Nest app), so skip it if you are in an Alexa, HomeKit, or SmartThings home. It also doesn’t fit well for an under-the-eave installation. I would only consider it if you can install it on the side of your house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wL9mok"&gt;6. Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sgWcjC"&gt;The best floodlight security camera that works with Apple HomeKit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="G88AG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10901161" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cl2zap"&gt;For those with privacy in mind when it comes to installing cameras in and around their home, the Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera is your best choice. Not only is there no cloud component at all — video is recorded locally, and all smart alerts are processed on the device — but you can also opt to store recordings on your personal FTP or Dropbox service. It is the only camera in our roundup that works with both Apple HomeKit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646453/apple-homekit-support-smart-home-security-routers-wwdc-2019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HomeKit Secure Video&lt;/a&gt;, and there are no monthly fees charged by Netatmo, which makes up a little bit for that eye-wateringly high price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UrJ8k"&gt;This is also a very stylish-looking floodlight camera, made out of aluminum instead of plastic, with a high-end feel that doesn’t look out of place on the side of more modern homes. However, it won’t install horizontally under an eave and needs to be mounted vertically to the side of a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhdUUH"&gt;In addition to free local storage, Netatmo offers free smart alerts for animals, people, and vehicles and the ability to control the light and camera in HomeKit, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlB03j"&gt;A built-in siren is an ear-splitting 105 dB, and the camera sends rich notifications with a zoomed-in clip of what it spotted that also appears on the well-laid-out timeline view in the Netatmo Security app. There is a non-siren version that is less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkdnHt"&gt;However, the video quality of the Netatmo Smart Outdoor Camera is just nowhere near as good as the competition. This is an older camera, and while it offers 1080p video, there is no HDR imaging or seemingly any other digital trickery more modern cameras use to produce a more vibrant image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Yfa3nk"&gt;The digital zoom is also limited, and bizarrely, there is no two-way audio. You can hear someone through the app, but you can’t speak to them. The light is also only rated for 1100 lumens, the lowest by far, but it feels plenty bright in use. I also like that you can choose specific types of motion to trigger the lights, so have it just come on for people or animals if you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64E5gTYOD_9PcpCWYE_Gf49CTQw=/148x0:1771x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69963739/Screen_Shot_2021_10_06_at_4.28.55_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the early pioneers of the smartphone almost made it big&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uAR9g2"&gt;A decade before Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, a tiny team of renegades imagined and tried to build the modern smartphone. Nearly forgotten by history, a little startup called Handspring tried to make the future before it was ready. In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn talks to the visionaries at Handspring and dives into their early successes and eventual failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80clsG"&gt;It’s a half-hour-long documentary featuring the key players at Palm and Handspring: Donna Dubinsky, Jeff Hawkins, Ed Colligan, and more. It’s one of our most ambitious video projects to date, and we can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO8iuz"&gt;Handspring may no longer be a household name, but it was briefly one of the fastest growing businesses in American history, selling Visor personal digital assistants. But the company had bigger aspirations: it saw a mobile future and took the first steps toward what would become the modern smartphone — even as it faced skepticism from the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGlhgO"&gt;The dream of the Handspring Treo turned out to be too far ahead of its time — before either the technology inside smartphones or the industry that sold them was ready for it. And a number of bad internal decisions and outside disasters would stall Handspring long enough that Apple would go on to do what Handspring couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Bphu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is also a look at an earlier time in tech — when the dot com bubble was bursting, but big tech hadn’t coalesced into five or six titanic monoliths. It was a time when many futures seemed possible, even one where a tiny startup could win the coming smartphone wars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Myh7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is now streaming worldwide. You can watch it on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; or our new app on Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, or Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNeXhn"&gt;To watch on your TV, visit your preferred streaming device’s app store and search for “The Verge,” or follow the instructions for each of the streaming devices you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to recover when your Facebook account is hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zk3QDRHisMc3jWvNCBUpnZauZII=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239182/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Facebook.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s only so much you can do&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PWBibb"&gt;Hopefully, the day will never come when you find your Facebook account has been hacked or taken over. It is an awful feeling, and I feel for you, for the world of hurt that you will experience in time and perhaps money to return your account to your rightful control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjhmyh"&gt;Let me take you through the recovery process. Afterward, I’ll provide some proactive security pointers you can follow to prevent this awful moment from happening, or at least reduce the chances that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eVRnjo"&gt;Three ways you can lose control of your Facebook account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GBAeoM"&gt;There are actually three different possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2jVE1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1. You let a family member or friend “borrow” your Facebook account on your computer or phone.&lt;/strong&gt; They proceed to consume content, post messages as you, or befriend random people. This happened to a friend of mine, who had a grandchild staying at her home for a week. The girl left town and left a mess behind on my friend’s Facebook account. “She didn’t post anything to my account, but I had odd friend requests that I had to clean up. I decided to just quit using my account.” This is more of a nuisance than a hack, but still annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQZsDF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remedy&lt;/strong&gt;: First, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security"&gt;use Facebook’s security page&lt;/a&gt; to check and see where else your account is already logged in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLx2naH9z_jZZi9yzo-U80laEGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019983/fb_where_you_are_logged_in.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pL2kpo"&gt;This list should also remind you of all of the devices that you have used Facebook on in the past. I took this screenshot after I found (and then removed) an older Windows laptop that I hadn’t used in years on the list. You’ll also see an entry for my iPhone that is located somewhere in Indiana. I haven’t visited that state in years, so sometimes the geo-location algorithms are a bit wonky. Even if your account isn’t hacked, it is helpful to routinely check this screen to make sure you haven’t enabled a login by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vT5WEq"&gt;If you don’t recognize (or don’t use) any of the devices on this list, click on the three vertical dots on the right and force those machines to log out of your account. Next, change your password to something unique. Also, remember in the future to sign out of Facebook (and Messenger) before you loan your device to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2gwTh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2. Someone uses your photo and name and sets up a new account.&lt;/strong&gt; Then they proceed to try to recruit your FB friends to their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48obpt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remedy&lt;/strong&gt;: There isn’t much you can do about it, other than tell people you are still you and to ignore the imposter. This should be a warning when you receive a friend request from someone you think you have already befriended, or someone you haven’t communicated with in years. A word to the wise: send them an email or text asking if the request is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxi5jE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 3. The doomsday scenario&lt;/strong&gt;. Someone guesses your account password and proceeds to lock you out of your account. This situation is the most dire, and fixing this will depend on what else you have linked to your Facebook account and how determined you are to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bteWhT"&gt;This happened to Elizabeth, a book author. She ended up working with two different friends who were IT professionals and a lawyer over the course of four months. She had two complicating factors that made recovering her account difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T3Ljz"&gt;First, she used Facebook ads to promote her books, so she had connected her login to her credit cards. This resulted in the hacker charging her card with their own ads to try to lure other victims to compromise themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkROHQ"&gt;The second complication was that she was using her pen name and a random birthday date for her account. During the recovery process, Facebook asks that you scan your ID to verify who you are. When she told me this, I became concerned for myself. For years I prided myself on using January 1 as my Facebook “birthday.” Now she was telling me that I was setting myself up for trouble if someone hacked my account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydEidC"&gt;She eventually got her password reset, but almost immediately the hacker reset and took over her account again. “I tried to get someone at Facebook to help me, but I couldn’t get anyone on the phone,” she told me. Before the pandemic, the company had a special phone hotline for industry insiders, “but this was discontinued,” she said. She had more success blocking the credit card charges by phoning her bank. “I was trying to be a step ahead of the hacker, and losing sleep. My whole life was put on hold as I tried to deal with the situation. I got no work done for months. I ended up changing my passwords on more than 30 different accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgc7nN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible remedies:&lt;/strong&gt; if you find yourself in this last situation, you have three basic choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkVZ3A"&gt;1.	&lt;strong&gt;Now would be a good time to leave Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;. The trouble is, you have someone who is pretending to be you, and could leverage your identity into criminal and uncomfortable situations. Not to mention that they could try to leverage bank accounts that are linked to your account or open up credit cards in your name. (More on that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nv9Q2m"&gt;2.	&lt;strong&gt;Try to reinstate your account on your own&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/hacked"&gt;Facebook’s own obscure and oftentimes contradictory steps&lt;/a&gt;. That is the way most people I know have tried. However, you will find out very quickly that there is no easy way to do this. You have to communicate with Facebook support through someone else’s account, which seems somewhat contradictory, so hopefully your spouse or friend is willing to lend a hand. (Don’t be tempted to set up a second account, because that could result in both of your accounts eventually being canceled.) Then you have to choose one of several options (finding an unauthorized post, an account that uses your own name and/or photos) and enter the rabbit hole to recover your account. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/raqrV2c5X7uVRgjgsCgiJfzrzOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019990/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_4.53.54_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVu97"&gt;If you use Facebook as a means to log into other internet services, you will have to disconnect these links — otherwise a hacker can then compromise these other accounts. If, like Elizabeth, you have connected your credit card or other financial accounts, you will have to contact these institutions and get these charges rescinded. Start by trying to use Facebook from other devices you have previously used: perhaps the hacker hasn’t automatically logged you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve07ny"&gt;3.	&lt;strong&gt;Use a third-party recovery service&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://hacked.com/how-to-recover-a-hacked-facebook-account/"&gt;Hacked.com&lt;/a&gt;. This will cost you $249, but the company will be persistent and if they can’t help you, they will refund your fee. You also get a year’s digital protection plan included that normally sells separately for $99. If you have a complex situation like Elizabeth (connected finances, non-matching birthday), I recommend using this path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJ7kCl"&gt;But make sure you aren’t employing some random hacker who might be taking your money and doing nothing else. I spoke to Hacked.com founder Jonas Borchgrevink, who outlined the various sequences of steps that his staffers try in a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/29/hacked-social-media-account/"&gt;recent Washington Post article&lt;/a&gt;. And he confirmed that if you are using a different name from what is shown on your ID, it is almost impossible to recover your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="74SQYZ"&gt;Proactive security measures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v8I9Cs"&gt;If you haven’t been hacked (yet) and are getting somewhat uncomfortable reading this, here are some steps to take to secure your Facebook account, or to at least reduce your pain points if it does happen. Start by doing at least one of them today, and make sure you take care of all of the items as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gIJ8bZ"&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Set up additional login security on your Facebook account. &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook offers you a set of confusing choices, but the one that I recommend is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"&gt;use a two-factor authenticator app&lt;/a&gt; such as Google Authenticator. (You can start at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/security/2fac/settings"&gt;this Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DyFJcTtcM2PBLLmfvxpsX54rWwQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019987/fb_mfa.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHicWa"&gt;Two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) uses an Android or iOS smartphone app as part of the login process. After you supply your username and password, Facebook asks you to type in a series of six numbers that are generated by the app. These numbers change every minute, so you need your phone nearby when you log in. If you want extra credit, take the time to enable this second factor method on your other accounts, including any banks and credit card companies that support this method (sadly, too few do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEsubv"&gt;Elizabeth was using a less secure method for her second factor: sending the six numbers as a text message to her phone. You can read more about &lt;a href="https://blog.strom.com/wp/?p=5572"&gt;why this isn’t my preference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHT0zs"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Check to see if you have any payment methods configured on Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt; While preparing for this article, I was surprised to find my PayPal address linked to my Facebook account — and I thought I was being careful about my Facebook security. There are two places to check. First, there is the page that shows if you have &lt;a href="https://secure.facebook.com/facebook_pay/?referrer=settings"&gt;set up any credit cards to make direct payments&lt;/a&gt; to individuals or causes, called Facebook Pay. Go to this other link to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/account_settings/account_billing/?act=46577174&amp;amp;pid=p1&amp;amp;page=account_settings&amp;amp;tab=account_billing_settings"&gt;remove any ad payment methods&lt;/a&gt;. If you are running any ad campaigns on your business, you will have to stop them first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rwb45o"&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Remove connected apps and websites. &lt;/strong&gt;If you have signed on to third-party apps using your Facebook credentials, now is the time to review and remove them (you can &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&amp;amp;ref=settings"&gt;find the appropriate page here&lt;/a&gt;). The same is true with removing any &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools&amp;amp;ref=settings"&gt;business integrations&lt;/a&gt;. You take a small hit in not being able to automatically log into these other services, but you also protect yourself if your account has been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6xj2k"&gt;If you have a Facebook business page, you should have at least two people who have admin rights to this page. (Go to Page Settings &amp;gt; Page Roles.) If your business account is hacked and you are the sole admin, it will be next to impossible to get it recovered. This contact should also have second factor authentication turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD2su1"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Check your account’s email contacts &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account&amp;amp;section=email&amp;amp;view"&gt;using this Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;). You should have at least a second contact email (or more) that Facebook can use to send you notifications in case your main email address becomes compromised. Of course, use different passwords with these different email accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuL6uM"&gt;I know, this seems like a lot of work, and there are a lot of places in the Facebook settings pages that you will have to visit and pay attention to. And chances are, the links provided above might not work in the future, as Facebook likes to make changes to its settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp6qpn"&gt;If these activities to make yourself more secure haven’t gotten you frustrated, you might want to continue improving your security. I recommend either the &lt;a href="https://www.withjumbo.com/"&gt;Jumbo smartphone app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avast.com%2Fen-us%2Favast-one&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22785819%2Ffacebook-hacked-security-privacy-recover" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Avast One&lt;/a&gt; (available on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android). Either can help walk you through the numerous steps to secure your Google, Twitter, and other accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cGBnJb"&gt;Parting words of wisdom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="itEKXv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think before you click.&lt;/strong&gt; If you get a message from what looks like a social media company saying that your account has been compromised, don’t follow any links or call any phone numbers in the message. This could be a lure from a hacker. Instead, navigate to the site or use its own app directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0CtFB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware of things that seem unusual&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep an eye out for messages you didn’t send, posts you didn’t create, or purchases you didn’t make. These could be tells that someone has guessed your password or compromised your account. If you are lucky, it might be an errant teen using one of your computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t7TLgE"&gt;As Elizabeth told me, “Being hacked is like getting a digital tattoo — everyone can see the after-effects of your poor choices.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone is now available on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Springboard" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwiEZ119sIizjxW6rSlE1xcoWew=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239202/Springboard_Thumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkkjV"&gt;In 1998, Donna Dubinsky and Jeff Hawkins quit Palm, a company they’d founded, to begin a new one: Handspring. They had a simple goal in mind: to eventually create the smartphone. Years before any of the technology was actually ready, their tiny startup began laying the necessary groundwork for what would become the Treo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zuyx7m"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;, we document the history of Handspring, from its dramatic beginnings to its tragic end. Along the way, we hear from five of the key players who tried to invent the modern smartphone years before the technology world was ready for it. It’s a story that interweaves the dotcom crash, technological innovations, wireless carrier resistance, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i267F"&gt;You can watch &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s smart TV apps on Roku, Fire TV, Android TV, and Apple TV. And now it’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_Vh9h3Ohw"&gt;also available on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RY6PV4"&gt;Alongside today’s YouTube release, we’re also publishing a special episode of The Vergecast, the discussion we recorded after the premiere of &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; at our 10-year anniversary party in New York last October. In it, Nilay Patel and I talk through some of the stories that were left on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I5v29y"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7469173203&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPiwth"&gt;I’d like to share a couple of them here, too. Both fall outside the scope of the documentary’s timeline, which was focused strictly on Handspring and not the eras of Palm that preceded and followed it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGhQfp"&gt;The first comes from Jeff Hawkins during the early days of Palm. His company had captured the lion’s share of the Personal Digital Assistant Market with the PalmPilot and some of its successors, which meant that Microsoft was going to take another run at them. Given Microsoft’s dominance, it was an existential threat. Here’s how Jeff, one of the great product executives in tech history, described his approach to handling that threat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rHHbaz"&gt;Our first big run in competition was with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_V"&gt;Palm V.&lt;/a&gt; That was with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR3G8n"&gt;We had been having a lot of success with the PalmPilot, and Microsoft said, literally, Steve Ballmer got in front of their annual conference, and they had a picture of Palm in a target, and it was like, “We’re gonna kill these guys,” you know? “We’re gonna crush them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjhIzb"&gt;I had engineers writing their resumes. I mean there were people saying, “Oh, man, it was a good run, sorry,” you know? The conventional wisdom was you can’t compete against Microsoft, and I said, “No, we can compete.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1Kftx"&gt;And I came up with a strategy for it. I said we’re gonna build hardware and the software. They’re only building the software, and they’re relying on other people to build the hardware. So what we oughta do on our next product is create the most beautiful piece of hardware we can create, which they’re not gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDTXFy"&gt;This was the controversial idea; they were adding all these features to their software, tons of features to their software. And I said, “We’re not gonna add any new features to our software,” because if we add new features to our software, people are going to compare our new software features to Microsoft’s new software features, and we’re gonna be behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jj1sPT"&gt;If we come out with a beautiful product, they won’t talk about our new software features. All they’ll do is talk about the new, beautiful product. And then they’ll say, “This product is more beautiful than anything that they got going on,” right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C85Xvs"&gt;So this was a controversial strategy of mine; we’re not going to add new features when the Palm V came out. There’s going to be &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; new software features. We could have had a whole list of things we could put in, but I said that’s not going to help us. And it worked beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRATR9"&gt;The Palm V came out, and we just crushed Microsoft. They just, you know, they just couldn’t compete at all. And they were blown away that we blew ‘em away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0Psb9f"&gt;The second story is a little different — and it’s also addressed in our Vergecast episode today, with some of the relevant audio. After Handspring merged back with Palm, Ed Colligan was running things, and eventually, all eyes were on Apple, which was widely expected to release a smartphone. A few weeks before the iPhone was first announced, Colligan sat for an interview with &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Markoff at the Churchill Club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJeC8k"&gt;Back in 2006, nothing had actually leaked about the iPhone, and so Markoff and Colligan speculated a bit on what Apple might be doing. Then the conversation turned to discussing competition in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EcXZR"&gt;All of this context is in service to correcting the record on one of Colligan’s responses. Somewhat famously, a line of his has been quoted over and over — most often by John Gruber at Daring Fireball in a post titled “&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/colligan_head_stuck"&gt;Palm CEO Ed Colligan’s Head Seems to be Stuck Somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.” He quotes the following real-time transcription — which, as it turns out, is inaccurate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uoIY7U"&gt;Responding to questions from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; correspondent John Markoff at a Churchill Club breakfast gathering Thursday morning, Colligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the wildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the finicky smartphone sector.&lt;br&gt;“We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent phone,” he said. “PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="w697Ht"&gt;We’ve gotten the original recording of the interview — our thanks to the &lt;a href="https://computerhistory.org/"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which has received the Churchill Club’s archives after it sadly had to shut down. Here’s the actual exchange, which begins after the Apple speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Gkm2Th"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Markoff&lt;/strong&gt;: But what will it look like in 2007? Apple does get in. Eric’s [Schmidt, then CEO of Google] wandering around talking about free phones. He’s got Andy Rubin, who was the founder of Danger doing something inside. He bought Andy’s startup. The phone market could look, I mean, it looks crowded now. It could look intensely crowded next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s intensely big. We just have to get our fair share of the pie. And let me tell you this, it’s not as easy as it looks. You’ve seen Motorola, one of the biggest phone companies in the world enter with a device that was going to take over the world, and it’s had enormous issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff&lt;/strong&gt;: The Q? You’re talking about the Q. [The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Q"&gt;Motorola Q&lt;/a&gt;, a hyped up Windows Mobile smartphone that struggled with technical problems and slow sales]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. And so I just would caution people that think they’re going to walk in here and just and do these. We’ve struggled for a few years here, figuring out how to make a decent phone. The PC guys are not going to just, you know, knock this out. I guarantee it. So, look, welcome, let’s go for it. We can’t stop all that. It’s going to happen, but it’s going to be, I don’t think it’ll be so easy for everybody, as everybody thinks to enter it. It’s a tough space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve been around this industry long enough, and you probably remember, maybe you don’t actually, the famous Wall Street Journal ad that Apple took out in 1981. “&lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/37-years-ago-steve-jobs-ran-apples-most-amazing-ad-heres-story-its-almost-been-forgotten.html"&gt;Welcome IBM. Seriously&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly. Well, look, you know, I’m not trying to be cocky about it. It is a tough, it’s a tough business. We’ve really struggled through that in the sense of making world class radios that perform on global networks consistently with all the applications that we deliver and…&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff: &lt;/strong&gt;Is radio expertise, something you have to have internally, is that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markoff: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah. That’s a black art, still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colligan: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sptpOD"&gt;The conversation moves on from there. Colligan clearly saw the competition coming was was likely worried and needed to put a brave face on it, but it’s notable that the more immediate prompt was Google and Motorola. And beyond the specifics of the wording, the overall tone and affect of Colligan’s response (which you can hear about in The Vergecast episode, starting around the 11 minute mark) is also relevant. It wasn’t a prediction that Apple would fail — it was more of an admission that smartphones were hard. And it wasn’t simply about Apple, but also Google and the new entrants running Windows Mobile (which Palm also used on its Treos at the time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkm6mC"&gt;Weeks later, the iPhone was announced and it was, of course, more popular than any Treo. However, it was Android that ended up walking in, becoming the fatal competition for Palm and its subsequent webOS phones. Verizon ultimately chose Google’s operating system and the Motorola Droid instead of the Palm Pre to compete with the then-AT&amp;amp;T-exclusive iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERCB4W"&gt;The Motorola Droid was spearheaded by Rick Osterloh — who got his start making SoundsGood MP3 Springboard modules for Handspring Visors before his company was acquired by Motorola. Palm held on for a little while longer and was acquired by HP, but the Droid was the beginning of the end. Osterloh now runs hardware at Google, and his Pixel phones face competition every bit as daunting as anything Palm once dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bresf2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Yg7O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What you learn after 350 hours of Joe Rogan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Portraits And Performances At The Ice House Comedy Club" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oq6ehSBl7JFWfJ3uaIo3KUD_Uug=/0x200:3000x2200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239155/869384308.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Schwartz/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eXCJTK"&gt;Here I am. Back again in your inbox on a Tuesday, in the final weeks before Christmas, New Year’s, and, for you business folks, the end of the quarter. For today’s Hot Pod, I interviewed the Media Matters researcher who listened to over 350 hours of &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; this year and reported back on what we’re all missing. He says the show, for those of us who aren’t spending our time there, is currently best described as a “cesspool of toxic masculinity that discusses elk hunting, mixed martial arts, anti-trans views, and harmful health information about the coronavirus pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv2tLr"&gt;We’ll also discuss separate — but, in some cases, related — Spotify situations and more “greenwashing” in podcast ads. More, more, more, just in time for the season of giving. Let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocdsuc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Meet the reporter dedicated to cataloging Joe Rogan’s bonkers claims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dhxqO"&gt;As you all well know, Joe Rogan is the most popular podcaster in the US and, likely, the world. He made his name interviewing major guests and for his off-the-cuff, at times controversial, takes on the world. Spotify reportedly paid him $100 million to bring his show to the platform exclusively, which resulted in it distributing a popular but contentious program. The platform keeps getting flack over what its star podcaster says, mostly because it’s spending so much money to keep him there and specifically courted this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmXXOD"&gt;Many of us who know this context might be curious to hear what Rogan is really up to on his podcast, only to then see his episodes can span hours and post multiple times per week. So enter Alex Paterson, a researcher at Media Matters whose beat as of the past year or so has included listening to Rogan and reporting back on everything he’s hearing. That work culminated in a story last week called: &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/joe-rogan-wrapped-year-covid-19-misinformation-right-wing-myths-and-anti-trans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Wrapped: A year of COVID-19 misinformation, right-wing myths, and anti-trans rhetoric&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJeTW6"&gt;I caught up with Paterson the day after the story ran and chatted with him to get a better sense of what he’s seeing. He tells me he listens to the episodes as soon as they come out, on 2X speed, to catch everything Rogan says. How are all those hours of Rogan listening going? Does Spotify seem to have taken any action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="FTDX4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOHExM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKCL2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking the time to chat. My first, obvious question: why are you so interested in Joe Rogan specifically? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGzdeR"&gt;Alex Paterson, researcher at Media Matters: I started regularly monitoring Joe Rogan’s podcast beginning last year in 2020 when he had Abigail Shrier on to push anti-trans rhetoric. She’s an anti-trans journalist who used to work at &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and during that podcast, they compared being trans to joining a cult or cutting yourself through self-harm. After that, knowing that Joe Rogan’s podcast is one of the most popular — if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most popular — podcasts in the world, I wanted to track the rhetoric he’s pushing on his show to help document how harmful it is to our society at large. Particularly in this new year, and as the pandemic has begun, Rogan has taken a clear lurch to the right and become a serial misinformer when it comes to COVID-19 misinformation, and we’ve been trying to document and limit the harms that he’s trying to push into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHN4XU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said you’ve been tracking him since 2020. How have you seen Rogan’s rhetoric change in that time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaoyXd"&gt;I believe he’s become more emboldened to push baseless conspiracy theories and right-wing lies over the past year. Since I started reporting on Rogan’s podcast, he’s broken into mainstream coverage fairly often: first, with his lie about left-wing people starting wildfires in Oregon, and then again really prominently, [saying] he would encourage healthy, young people not to get vaccinated. And throughout all of that reporting, at least from my view, he hasn’t faced any real punishment from Spotify. And I think that’s emboldened him to continue pushing hate and lies on his podcast. Just from listening to him every day, he’s by no means remitting conspiracy theories and false rhetoric on his show. If anything, he’s leaning into it more. He’s celebrated in conservative spaces for it. He’s a darling of the conservative right in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bptI1y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know you and Media Matters more broadly cover the wider world of the right, so places like Fox and OAN. Do you see any parallels between that world and Rogan’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eApjT"&gt;Yeah, I completely see it as related. Rogan is someone who celebrates himself as being a so-called independent thinker who has both conservative and progressive values, and I think that perfectly illustrates our general media landscape’s bend towards right-wing views and over accommodating ring-wing views and not challenging right-wing misinformation. So I think he plays a pretty central role in that landscape, and he’s also deeply connected to the network of conservative media. He hosts Ben Shapiro. He hosts Alex Jones. He’s a huge supporter of Tucker Carlson, who we know is Fox News’ hate-mongerer-in-chief. I think he plays a central role in the right-wing misinformation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe0GOX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Much of us in the podcast world are interested in how Spotify treats Rogan. Have you gotten any sense that it’s taking action to moderate his content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcoKXR"&gt;Rogan has stated numerous times that Spotify has never spoken to him about the hate that he pushes on his podcast or taken any steps to try to curt him from doing so. You’re hearing it from his mouth, and then when we look at Spotify’s year-end summary for their Wrapped, he’s the star of their podcasting, which is an empire Spotify is very clearly trying to grow. On YouTube, which I would say has stronger enforcement around COVID misinformation, though it’s far from great, his show would often be demonetized and occasionally removed. I think he views Spotify as a place where he could spread his specific kind of bigotry and vile without any real consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFnqqI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you seen any specific moments where you think YouTube would have moderated his content, but Spotify doesn’t?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4uMBw"&gt;Oh, yeah, absolutely. We do a lot of work at Media Matters around tech accountability and terms of service, and generally, I would say social media companies are failing to regulate right-wing extremism on the internet. And Spotify has some of the least, almost non-existent, terms of service to protect users and the general public from hatred and targeted violence. Joe Rogan has misgendered and denigrated trans youth on his podcast and never faced any consequences. We have seen YouTube take some steps to remove content that’s similar to that, and YouTube has a policy against promoting COVID-19 misinformation. That’s become the central core of Rogan’s podcast, and Spotify, including CEO Daniel Ek, has refused to take any action against Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvemzN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t rely on transcripts to monitor the show, and I’m looking slightly ahead, but I do wonder how much that speaks to the broader issues platforms might have moderating shows. Transcripts don’t catch everything, especially with speech nuances. So I wonder if you or the team have proposed solutions to help platforms solve these issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHxjr1"&gt;The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Spotify and Joe Rogan and moderation, like how we could moderate extremism online, is that Spotify isn’t even at that table. That would appear to be something they aren’t even considering with Joe Rogan. So to imagine a world in which Spotify might monitor his transcript is so far from reality that we’re just asking them to, at a very baseline, stop their most prominent podcast host from increasing vaccine hesitancy and harming our nation’s public response to the pandemic overall. Joe Rogan has shown really clearly that he will use his podcast to spread conspiracy theories, right-wing lies, [and] racist rhetoric in order to sort of promote himself. And yes, Spotify, their CEO, and their comms team has gone on the record time and time again saying that he hasn’t violated their terms. At this point, it’s like, what would it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnzBj1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I appreciate you doing this work and taking the time. Is there anything else you think people should know about Rogan that they might not be considering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fSt2V"&gt;One thing we’ve done at Media Matters is try to document how social media algorithms and far-right online communities can radicalize everyday people fairly easily. I think Rogan is a good example of that. Let’s say you’re a young man listening to &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, and you want to get tips on bodybuilding or how to eat healthfully, and then Rogan starts discussing that vaccines are a form of gene therapy with Ben Shapiro, and then perhaps you go to Ben Shapiro’s website, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Wire&lt;/em&gt;, and there, you fall into a cesspool of hatred and bigotry, and once you click on a &lt;em&gt;Daily Wire&lt;/em&gt; article, if you share it on Facebook, you’re just going to be led further and further down the far-right rabbit hole. That can take someone from being an everyday person [to] suddenly being fed news and misinformation about QAnon and other right-wing lies. I think it’s important to keep in mind that Joe Rogan spreading this misinformation has real-world consequences that can have really dire effects for marginalized people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rkAvQz"&gt;
&lt;p id="oDvXiM"&gt;For what it’s worth, I reported on Rogan telling young adults &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"&gt;not to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; and pointed out that Spotify had specifically removed music and podcasts that claimed vaccines not only kill people but also have microchips in them. (Both of which are not true.) At the time, Spotify said it “prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.” I’d encourage you to check out Paterson’s &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/joe-rogan-experience/joe-rogan-wrapped-year-covid-19-misinformation-right-wing-myths-and-anti-trans"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; for a better sense of what Rogan is saying and decide for yourself whether it falls within those bounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu64r5"&gt;And if you’re wondering how influential Rogan really is, take a peek at &lt;a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2021/12/4/22817972/dana-white-announces-hes-covid-free-thanks-dr-joe-rogan"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses “Dr. Joe Rogan’s” influence on various people’s COVID treatment plans, namely UFC president Dana White and his family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6grQZL"&gt;I reached out to Spotify to see if the team wanted to comment on the above interview. A spokesperson, who asked to remain anonymous because of the “sensitivity of the subject matter,” sent the same comment as above back but with this tacked onto the end: “When content is flagged for possible violations of our policies, it is thoroughly reviewed by our in-house team and outside experts, if necessary. If that content is found to be in violation of our policies, the appropriate enforcement action is taken.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7iF5f"&gt;Meanwhile, in separate Spotify moderation news…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ilimO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Racist, antisemitic, hateful podcasts live on Spotify and Google Podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29QSqq"&gt;Sky News &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/antisemitism-racism-and-white-supremacist-material-in-podcasts-on-spotify-investigation-finds-12484728"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an investigation on Friday into extremist podcasts and found “several days’ worth” of content promoting “extreme views such as scientific racism, Holocaust denial and far-right antisemitic conspiracy theories.” Reporter Victoria Elms says explicit slurs can be heard, as well as direct calls to violence against Jewish people. She also notes that these podcasters are using the episode description box to promote hateful videos hosted on other platforms, including one about “Dylann Roof’s insightful manifesto.” Spotify removed the content after Sky News’ reachout, but they remain live on Google Podcasts. Pertinent to us is Elms’ note about the black box that is these platforms’ moderation efforts. I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22273071/podcast-moderation-apple-spotify-podbean-steve-bannon"&gt;this in February&lt;/a&gt; — particularly how difficult it will be to catch and take down infringing content — and continue to think about how dire this might become when every platform includes an audio component, the feature du jour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3g4Da3"&gt;I hate to keep hammering y’all with bad Spotify things, but we’re going to keep going. It’s the winter energy, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9xLtJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify takes down comedians’ albums over royalty dispute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Qdf7"&gt;This is tangential for us but interesting, as it relates to spoken word content. Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-removes-some-comedians-work-from-streaming-service-11638626401"&gt;has removed&lt;/a&gt; “hundreds of comedians’” work from its platform over a new royalties fight. Summed up as simply as I can: comedians are compensated as performers through their label or distributor, but they want to now also receive writing credits, or what global rights administration company Spoken Giants calls their literary rights. (This parallels the royalties in the music industry — a songwriting credit pays different royalties, which can be more lucrative. I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22672704/olivia-rodrigo-switched-on-pop-charlie-harding-music-copyright"&gt;listening to or reading&lt;/a&gt; my boss’s podcast,&lt;em&gt; Decoder&lt;/em&gt;, with Charlie Harding of &lt;em&gt;Switched on Pop&lt;/em&gt; for more on how this works in music land.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KU6Ci6"&gt;Spoken Giants is leading the charge here, trying to negotiate for these comics to receive the writing credits and subsequent royalty payouts, but the comics are in the lurch right now, unable to have their content streamed at all on one of the world’s biggest platforms. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that Spoken Giants “started by representing writers of comedy bits and jokes, with plans to expand across podcasts, speeches and lectures.” The podcast writing credit royalty system, could it happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmUVyb"&gt;Now, let’s close the loop on the ExxonMobil &lt;em&gt;Daily&lt;/em&gt; ad, for now at least...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1A7LnR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FnpL4S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcast ads make up oil companies’ “greenwashing” strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Ul7C"&gt;A few weeks ago, I covered the debacle over an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22797808/podcast-app-acquire-radiopublic-acast-rss-feed-hot-pod"&gt;ExxonMobil ad that appeared on &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The ad, climate change reporter Emily Atkin wrote, was misleading and not wholly indicative of what Exxon is actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiwHoj"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Drilled&lt;/em&gt; podcast host and journalist Amy Westervelt &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/04/exxon-podasts-oil-company-ads-climate-crisis"&gt;published a bigger piece&lt;/a&gt; on the growing trend of oil companies’ ads showing up in podcasts. She writes that podcast publishers have to “develop their own guidelines and fact-checking processes” around the climate-friendly claims they make because the Federal Trade Commission mostly only cares about claims around products, which the oil companies don’t advertise. The piece culminates in the concluding thought, “What’s in place now for identifying misinformation in ads is not really a framework for identifying greenwashing,” says John Cook, research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub. So even if the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and others implement fact-checking for ads, which they say they already do, squishy language from oil companies could pass that test and seemingly already has. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoBLhk"&gt;Broadly, all of today’s stories add up to a bigger conversation around the new world that podcasting inhabits. The industry’s receiving more attention than ever before from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but also bigger publications who spot strange and bad things happening. The industry’s growing and now faces the same problems massive social platforms, like Facebook and YouTube, contend with regularly. Cook, from Westervelt’s story, advises Facebook on climate disinformation, just so you can get a sense of how much expertise is needed at the platforms. The expectations are higher for podcasts, and this tension between stepping up and meeting them versus punting until podcasting has more resources will only continue moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rF2qyU"&gt;I love a lil year-end tease. If you want more audio and podcasting industry analysis, you can subscribe for two additional issues &lt;a href="https://hotpodnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, I’ll catch you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Alexa’s new elder care service launches today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsDs73R5qqr-BUhLHHbAIC1sCjc=/625x0:7375x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239220/Alexa_Together_app.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Alexa Together launches today.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cH5itQ"&gt;First announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22686948/alexa-together-caregiving-amazon-echo-subscription"&gt;Amazon’s fall hardware event, Alexa Together&lt;/a&gt; is officially launching today, Tuesday, December 7th. A new subscription service that expands on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;existing Alexa Care Hub&lt;/a&gt;, Alexa Together is designed to offer a minimally invasive way to use Amazon’s voice assistant and associated Echo speakers to both assist and keep tabs on an elderly loved one or other person who requires a caregiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxOf1j"&gt;Almost since Alexa launched, industrious families have found ways to make the artificially intelligent assistant help them when it comes to looking after a remote loved one. Electronically “dropping in” on an elderly family member to check on them and sharing Alexa accounts so that they can see their activity have been simple — if inelegant — ways to know that your family member is okay; especially helpful if they aren’t always good at answering a phone call. But the system wasn’t designed for that use case, making it somewhat invasive for the person who’s being “monitored.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOU8ls"&gt;First with Care Hub and now with Alexa Together, Amazon has developed new features based on how its customers shoe-horned the Alexa assistant into these use cases. The result is a product that could make the process of remotely caring for an elderly loved one easier and ultimately more helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/stLW2rtDA8Eu4gsiLYJnrgUV3X8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069699/Alexa_Together_Routines.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa Together notifies caregivers about their loved ones’ activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ca67S"&gt;The new service costs $19.99 a month or $199 per year, and it replaces the existing — free — Care Hub service. For that new fee, customers get a professional monitoring service and some more proactive features. There is a six-month free trial available and all Care Hub customers get a free year of Alexa Together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8JWEH"&gt;The two most notable features arriving with Alexa Together are Urgent Response and a fall detection capability. This adds 24/7 hands-free access to a professional emergency helpline, allowing the user to say “Alexa, call for help,” to an Echo speaker and be connected with an agent. The agent can then request the dispatch of police, the fire department, or an ambulance, and Alexa also sends a notification to the designated caregiver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYgcTe"&gt;Fall detection requires third-party hardware — currently it works with devices from Assistive Technology Services (ATS) and Vayyar. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/VAYYAR-Care-Touchless-Compatible-Detection/dp/B09JXV82Z6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vayyar Care&lt;/a&gt; costs $250 and is a wall-mounted device from the makers of &lt;a href="https://vayyarhome.com/"&gt;Vayyar Home&lt;/a&gt;. It’s exclusively for Alexa Together (although Vayyar makes a standalone product, too) and uses sensors and radio waves to detect falls. ATS’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SkyAngelCare-Detection-Compatible-Together-Automatically/dp/B09LGJYPY8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SkyAngelCare&lt;/a&gt; is a fall-detection pendant that communicates over Wi-Fi to Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFRO8V"&gt;Both devices can be set to alert Alexa to ask the user if they want to call Urgent Response, a more proactive approach than waiting for the user to ask for help. Unlike similar devices on the market today, there are no ongoing subscription fees to use these, beyond the Alexa Together fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgq1GC"&gt;The activity feed and alerts from Care Hub are now part of Alexa Together. This lets a caregiver know that the person is up and going about their day by providing an alert in the Alexa app once the person being monitored first interacts with Alexa. It works with other Alexa-compatible smart home devices to register activity, too, including smart lights, thermostats, and motion sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxNhNs"&gt;This is a more privacy-conscious way of monitoring someone, without using intrusive technologies, such as cameras, and without revealing exactly what they are doing. For example, the caregiver can see there was an interaction but not what it was specifically. Another feature is that Alexa Together can alert a caregiver if there has been no activity by a certain time, so they can know to check in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOjS9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Together is more privacy-conscious than a camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v3xhNU"&gt;A new Remote Assist option is also part of Alexa Together. This allows a caregiver access to a person’s Alexa account, with their permission, so they can help set up features remotely — such as setting reminders, adding contacts to be able to call or message with their voice, putting items on a shopping list, and linking music and video services. Finally, the ability to add multiple caregivers, which is coming early next year, is also a new option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1n7zV"&gt;Amazon is clearly making a big play for the aging in place market. Aging in place is defined by the CDC as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/terminology.htm"&gt;“The ability to live in one’s own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level.”&lt;/a&gt; This is something the smart home is a natural ally in, and a number of other Amazon products announced at the same event earlier this year have the potential to help with this in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekYyxk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa"&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which combines a home security system and an Eero mesh Wi-Fi system in one, could make it easier to set up a smart home in a relative’s house with just one device. Experts in this space cite a security system with fire, smoke, and water leak monitoring capabilities as the most important tool to install in an elderly loved one’s home. And of course, for modern-day security systems, a strong internet connection is essential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNGUD8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s little talked about (at least recently) “neighborhood network,” has two new partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.carebandremembers.com/careband-and-amazon-sidewalk-explore-opportunities-to-enable-older-adults-living-with-dementia-to-remain-safe-and-healthy-at-home/"&gt;CareBand&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Flife360-and-amazon-sidewalk-imagine-ways-to-keep-loved-ones-safer-and-more-connected%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822026%2Famazon-alexa-together-elder-care-price-features-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Life360,&lt;/a&gt; both of which make products designed to know exactly where your loved ones are. Amazon announced both companies are producing devices that will be Sidewalk-enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAQyKB"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765217/amazon-glow-review-video-calling-projector"&gt;Amazon Glow device&lt;/a&gt; — an interactive projector that lets loved ones play games and read books with children remotely — is designed for grandparents to stay connected with their grandchildren. Voice assistants in general are helpful allies in combatting loneliness, which is associated with higher mortality rates in the elderly. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro has been touted as one day being able to help take your blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nmXgIP"&gt;Finally, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;Astro, Amazon’s rolling robot&lt;/a&gt;, was promoted at the event as potentially being able to deliver a blood pressure cuff to a person at regular intervals. While the robot may seem like a bit of a pointless novelty at this stage, use cases for elder care are probably the most compelling (if not fully realized). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfsosi"&gt;Among the larger tech companies, Amazon is leading the way here, but it’s not the first to try. &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-assured-living-lets-aging-parents-stay-at-home/"&gt;Best Buy launched Assured Living&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, offering a complete hardware and software solution for monitoring loved ones. It’s since disappeared and Best Buy now promotes various gadgets sold at its stores that help with &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhealth-wellness-solutions%2Factive-aging%2Fpcmcat1522420940237.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1522420940237&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“active aging.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64aCG8"&gt;There are many standalone devices that have attempted to make an impact on the age-tech space. The &lt;a href="https://lifepod.com/"&gt;LifePod&lt;/a&gt; is a proactive Alexa-based voice-enabled speaker that does a lot of what Alexa Together offers. The &lt;a href="https://www.grandpad.net/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw5JSLBhCxARIsAHgO2SeMWIytcXeRJAtxq-A4dawqkWSG8HVCJPI9mAAM6M5RqqX5x-6g_PUaAtwDEALw_wcB"&gt;GrandPad&lt;/a&gt; is a simplified tablet designed to make technologies like video calling easier for seniors. There are also a plethora of tools for managing medications, gadgets that can help with cooking safely, and devices that help you stay in touch with the outside world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UIbMv"&gt;To date, however, smart home tech has largely failed to capture this market. Possibly due to the piecemeal approach, likely due to the high costs of these gadgets and doubts around their long-term staying power, and definitely because of the privacy concerns of the elderly customer. Any device seen as spying on someone — whether it’s with a camera or not — has a large hurdle to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dvg3Kd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart home tech has failed in elder care efforts before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W5lK4T"&gt;But this is a real problem and a major moment for the smart home. The number of Americans over 65 will double from around &lt;a href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/Aging%20and%20Disability%20in%20America/2020ProfileOlderAmericans.Final_.pdf"&gt;50 million to nearly 100 million by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. By 2034, &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-41-population-projections.html"&gt;seniors will outnumber children&lt;/a&gt;. Most people would prefer to stay in their homes as they age rather than spend their life savings on assisted living facilities or nursing homes. Add to that the fact that there are over &lt;a href="https://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/AARP-835-AARP-Caregiving-in-the-US-Infographics-vFINAL-scaled.jpg"&gt;53 million unpaid caregivers&lt;/a&gt; dedicating a large portion of their lives to caring for elderly relatives, and the math here just makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="txGF1u"&gt;Equipping an entire home with smart devices enabled by artificial intelligence, both from Amazon and others, can cost less than one year of in-home care or one month in a care home. Combined with significant advances in telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the smart home could become a crucial part of how we look after our elderly loved ones today and, one day, ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YO3jgs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZR0PT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s kid-focused Messenger app is getting a dark mode and new voice effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sgEum7gxHumzwDJDKeYOJqYyP-8=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239100/Header_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messenger Kids’ new features in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoS6aw"&gt;Messenger Kids, the child-friendly version of Meta’s Messenger service (aka Facebook Messenger), is being updated with a dark mode, as well as new audio effects for voice messages, the &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/12/06/messenger-kids-introduces-dark-mode-and-fun-expressions-features/"&gt;service has announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXLHDP"&gt;Dark mode came to the main Messenger app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/15/18311582/facebook-messenger-dark-mode-android-ios"&gt;at the beginning of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but now it’s also coming to the version of the app that’s designed for children between the ages of six and 12. Perfect for any kids preparing for a difficult teenage goth phase. It’s coming to the iOS version of the app first, with Android to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQL11H"&gt;Meanwhile, voice effects are rolling out in the weeks ahead and, like the service’s dark mode, will be coming to iOS first. They sound like a fun addition, working with the service’s existing voice messages feature to let a child sound like a robot, ghost, gorilla, mouse, or like they’re talking into a seashell. The five options appear after recording a voice message, allowing you to adjust it before it’s sent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QiZDQQjRD9izRvi-48GnFH139KA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069724/Voice_Modulation.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are five voice effects to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SThhRV"&gt;Alongside these two new features, Messenger Kids is also adjusting its games feature to let children start two-player built-in games from within a chat using the orange controller icon. These were previously tucked away in a separate Explore tab. This change is coming to iOS first, with Android to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaDk1w"&gt;Although it hasn’t been without its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20706250/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-chat-app-unauthorized-adults"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20837552/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-markey-blumethal-letter"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt;, Messenger Kids has largely flown under the radar in recent years. Especially compared to Instagram, which was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;publicly distance itself&lt;/a&gt; from reports it was working on a version of Instagram for children under 13 earlier this year. But with these inoffensive features like audio effects and a tightly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122067/facebook-messenger-kids-parental-controls-chat-history-blocked-contacts"&gt;parental-controlled design&lt;/a&gt;, Messenger Kids has broadly escaped similar levels of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the hit new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999; however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9uVs7jC5c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $899.99. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9u0JFONVF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99. These deals can come and go quickly, though, and if you’re gift shopping, you have to keep in mind a retailer’s cut-off date for arriving in time for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;The MacBook Pro line has been split into two different segments — for the time being. The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards — save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2iOUM"&gt;The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, are all new and come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs. There are multiple variants of both models, though we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration outside of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s current discount of around $78 on the base 14-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. Though now that we’re in the heart of the holiday season, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDERSc"&gt;Right now, the only deal on the new crop of MacBook Pros is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s price of $1,920.72 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with M1 Pro CPU. That’s a discount of $78.44 for the base model with M1 Pro processor, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model is on sale for $100 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,199. The larger, 512GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,249.99 at checkout, one of its best prices to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $569.99 at checkout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $749.99 at checkout&lt;/a&gt;. Costco members can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-512gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694240.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB models for the same price&lt;/a&gt;, though no other retailers are offering this same discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>After decades of surveillance, Muslims struggle with how much to share online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbyy3OCDQh2XmlmuhTM47t3-HxM=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70238973/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Islam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The long shadow of NYPD surveillance after 9/11&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="sefJQI"&gt;Thirteen years ago, Mosaab Sadeia accompanied his father to a mosque in Staten Island. He remembers it was during the winter, after the last Isha prayer when his father went to meet with the sheikh. Mosaab remembers grabbing a book from the bookshelf and sitting down down to read it. Then, a man he had never seen before in his close-knit community came up to him and asked him, “What do you think of Hamas?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUe0mA"&gt;Sadeia was stunned. He was just nine years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icx4Iu"&gt;The man was suspected of being an informant, although it was never confirmed. (Many never are.) And though it was Mosaab’s first encounter with surveillance, it wouldn’t be his last. It’s a common story among Muslims in New York — and in an age of oversharing, that experience has had a strange impact. Many, like Sadeia, have grown up cautious of saying too much online, wary of others like the man he met that day. A younger generation of Muslims has taken a more vocal approach, eager to break out of the fear of surveillance. But for both, the experience of social media is inseparable from the feeling of being watched — and the experience of being Muslim in New York City after 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="SsjLZ5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="448cyZ"&gt;Since 2002, the NYPD has religiously profiled and surveilled Muslims in New York City and neighboring states &lt;a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/radicalization-west-homegrown-threat"&gt;in an attempt to find “radicalization.”&lt;/a&gt; The NYPD Intelligence Division has mapped Muslim communities, conducted photo and video surveillance, recruited informants, tracked those who changed their names, and generated intelligence databases, &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/factsheet-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program"&gt;according to the ACLU&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/about/awards-and-recognition/highlights-of-aps-pulitzer-prize-winning-probe-into-nypd-intelligence-operations"&gt;the Associated Press exposed the extent of the NYPD’s surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, determining that the NYPD “subjected entire neighborhoods to surveillance and scrutiny, often because of the ethnicity of the residents, not because of any accusations of crimes.” &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/ap-in-the-news/2012/nypd-muslim-spying-led-to-no-leads-terror-cases"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the NYPD acknowledged in testimony that the Demographics Unit — its name for the internal group that carried out the surveillance — never generated a lead or triggered a terrorism investigation in its years of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLYiLt"&gt;In 2014, the Demographics Unit was discontinued, but it still casts a long shadow over the city’s Muslim communities. Sadeia is now outreach director at Majlis Ash-Shura: Islamic Leadership Council of New York, and remembers countless other incidents where he felt he was being surveilled. He has had random people ask him what his opinions on the caliphate are; what he thinks about Israel. Some of the people who asked him such questions were later confirmed by the mosques to be informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeWnI7"&gt;“It’s just someone who you have no idea who they are. You’ve never seen them and no one knows them and they come inside the masjid and start asking really weird questions. And you’re just sitting there not really sure how to react,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “A normal person in the time we live in doesn’t ask questions like that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3FEd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t share many details of my personal life online. That’s just my way of protection.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ph5WFg"&gt;Even though he attended an Islamic school, Sadeia says he was always cautious of what he said in class. In college, he learned to “speak smart.” Even after graduating, he is not as active on social media as other people his age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga6ZNr"&gt;“Even after I made a social media account, there was always the rule of ‘You don’t talk about politics on social media, you don’t talk about what happens in other countries on social media.’ Partly because of the US government and its history of entrapping people and lying about it,” he said. “I don’t share many details of my personal life online. That’s just my way of protection. Not that it isn’t out there and can’t be found, but why should I make it easier for someone who is tracking me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKAu9C"&gt;Ainikki Riikonen, a researcher with the technology and national security program with the Center for a New American Security, says the conversation around Muslim surveillance is shifting, but only slowly. “Counterterrorism is a profession, it’s an expertise. People spend their lives getting Ph.D.’s and getting really specific knowledge on very specific groups and ways of network analysis,” Riikonen says. “Twenty years on, there’s no excuse to be doing this blanket surveillance and targeting people on the basis of religion. There’s absolutely no excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kTfxOK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why do we even bother pretending that we’re not fully Muslim? Why do we even bother not being our authentic selves?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NdwYy"&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Haris Khan, a community organizer and a board member at the Muslim Democratic Club of New York (MDCNY), is much more active on social media than Sadeia. When Khan was a student at the City College of New York, he heard from many of his classmates about their experiences and how afraid they were. During his own time in college, he found himself shying away from his faith publicly in an effort to not be so different, to try to fit in, to assimilate. Eventually he realized there was no point in staying silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oAMEQ"&gt;“Trying to fit in or being quiet about issues … Even if you do all of that, you still get called a terrorist,” Khan said. “So why do we even bother pretending that we’re not fully Muslim? Why do we even bother not being our authentic selves? They’re going to weaponize our identity either way. We might as well use it to organize and mobilize and speak our truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFPvCy"&gt;Khan works in the political field, and even that doesn’t stop him from showcasing his opinions publicly online. &lt;a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-settlers-broke-al-aqsa-compound-despite-muslim-holy-event-prior-eid-al-adha"&gt;After the historic Al-Aqsa Mosque was raided&lt;/a&gt; in Jerusalem during Ramadan this year, Khan put up a tweet about how he was feeling. Soon enough, he had people tweeting back telling him he should be fired from his government job because, as he saw it, “I have a political opinion about ending the apartheid.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zn3x4"&gt;Still, he sees Twitter blowback as a small price to pay for having a space to share his views openly. “I am not afraid of being surveilled for my viewpoints, for my desire to see a just world,” Khan said. “They can copy and paste my tweets and my posts. It is what it is, that is who I am. That is what my family has taught me. That is what the community I belong to values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NI3P5"&gt;In 2012, Asad Dandia, the community programs coordinator at the Council on American-Islamic Relations New York (CAIR-NY), found out he had been surveilled for seven months by a person he had befriended. The informant traveled with him and his friends to events, lectures, and would even assist them in delivering food to homeless people every night. So when Dandia found out that his friend was an informant all along, the betrayal was palpable. He remembers anxiety attacks and a constant paranoia. The next year, he joined &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/raza-v-city-new-york-legal-challenge-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program"&gt;a class action lawsuit against the NYPD&lt;/a&gt; over surveillance of Muslims, resulting in new protections against the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEjc0u"&gt;Ultimately, the experience made Dandia value his ties to the community even more. “We have to keep each other safe.” he said. “One of the intended effects of surveillance is to stifle your speech, to stifle your community activity, and essentially they want you to not be active. I always say do the reverse. Be as active and involved as possible, get in touch with organizations that can help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="G2EhL1"&gt;“And do not cower,” he continued. “Because they want you to cower.”&lt;/p&gt;
