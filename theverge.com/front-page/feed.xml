    <title>Lenovo made a wireless charger for your laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sew8VjSvFkcnV0hCLzVP0e8_0LE=/0x0:2100x1400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497384/Screenshot_2021_06_24_at_15.18.45.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bg2Y7S"&gt;Lenovo has announced a new product called the Go Wireless Charging Kit, which lets you retrofit wireless charging functionality to a wide variety of laptops. It makes use of “Power by Contact” technology from Energy Square, rather than the more common Qi standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzneP1"&gt;The kit consists of a 3.2mm-thick brushed metal charging mat that you plug into the wall and leave at your desk, as well as a long wireless charging receiver that attaches to the base of your laptop and connects over USB-C. Once set up, Lenovo says it should charge most 13-inch to 14-inch “non-touch notebooks of up to 65W” with efficiency of 93 percent, and it’ll work with both Windows and macOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i30wzLO4H8xfFUsRUHss8S0dojQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678555/02_Lenovo_Go_USB_C_Wireless_Charging_Kit_Mat_Dongle_Hero_Front.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6zjKJ"&gt;Wireless charging on laptops is pretty rare. Dell released what it called the world’s first wirelessly charging 2-in-1, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/11/15955350/dell-latitude-7000-price-availability-wireless-charging"&gt;the Latitude 7285&lt;/a&gt;, in 2017, although it was more of a tablet that could be charged through a keyboard base. Intel also made efforts to integrate the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5430310/a4wp-wireless-ultrabook-charging-dell-joins"&gt;Rezence&lt;/a&gt; magnetic resonance charging standard into its laptop specifications, but nothing was ever released commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vx2meT"&gt;Lenovo will release the Go Wireless Charging Kit in October for $139.99. It’s part of a new range of Go-branded mobile accessories including a Qi-equipped power bank, wireless mice, headphones, and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the tech antitrust reform bills are struggling to move forward</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rWd-KLDfhzt5we6PpcDxKdX39C4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497376/acastro_200730_4122_techEarnings_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Republicans and Democrats are having very different conversations&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="Q0E8Sa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GLBddh"&gt;Watching Congress debate a package of tech reform bills this week has been sort of like watching a group of people ordered to eat a giant submarine sandwich all at the same time. Everyone has started in a different place, no one agrees on a path forward, and people almost can’t help butting heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBj6UR"&gt;This should be a moment of huge importance in the history of tech and democracy in the United States. The House Judiciary Committee investigated competition in the tech industry for a year. During that time, Congress held 10 hearings. In the end, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;a 449-page report&lt;/a&gt; on the subject was produced. And from that report came &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;a package of bills&lt;/a&gt; that, if passed, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/congress-readies-an-assault-on-the"&gt;would reshape the tech industry&lt;/a&gt; and probably some other large corporations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDsFfl"&gt;The bills are rooted in concerns that I have long shared and written about. A small number of companies now controls vast sectors of the economy with little oversight or accountability. How their platforms are used and abused is of huge consequence globally. And in many cases these companies have acted to stifle competition — lowering prices to drive their rivals under; privileging their own products over competitors; preventing competitors from using their services entirely; using near-monopoly profits to maintain their positions; and acquiring potential threats before they can disrupt the incumbent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lv6vi7"&gt;At the same time, despite Congress taking so long to intervene, market competition has continued anyway. Google may spend billions to ensure it is the default search engine on the iPhone; but its rival DuckDuckGo&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/"&gt; just raised $100 million amid record growth&lt;/a&gt;, and the Brave browser &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547158/brave-search-beta-browser-private-independent-index"&gt;just introduced a search engine&lt;/a&gt; of its own. Facebook had social networking mostly to itself in the mid-2010s, and is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;working to own the future of virtual reality&lt;/a&gt;. But TikTok and Snapchat now dominate the attention of younger users, and the company is gradually remaking all of its apps in an anxious effort to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="u69WdF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At stake: the state-like &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; a handful of apps have over aspects of our daily lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="144cth"&gt;Of course, the mere existence of rivals doesn’t necessarily mean that the current market is perfectly fair or functional. But it does increase the challenge for writing legislation that addresses our underlying concerns about the platforms. Members of Congress talked at great length on Wednesday about wanting to make markets more competitive, but what is really at stake is the state-like &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; a handful of apps have to control aspects of our daily lives. It isn’t that no one can conceivably compete with them in the future; it’s that they have too much power &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ingK0j"&gt;That’s why I like &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/228/text"&gt;this bill&lt;/a&gt;, which would increase funding for antitrust enforcement by 30 percent. Rather than simply ban most mergers and acquisitions by default, as another bill in the package would do, this one empowers the Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Department of Justice to scrutinize M&amp;amp;A more carefully. The downside of such an approach is that absent other legislation, courts could strike down the agencies’ enforcement actions; the benefit is that agencies can make more informed, case-by-case decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8YlHR"&gt;I also like a bill &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3849/text"&gt;designed to make it easier for consumers to switch between platforms&lt;/a&gt;, even if it raises real privacy concerns. (Are the phone numbers in my contacts app really mine to share, even if it makes consumer apps much more competitive?) I also like aspects of Rep. David Cicilline’s bill&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3816/text?r=8&amp;amp;s=1"&gt; American Choice and Innovation Online Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would restrict platforms from indulging in some of their worst impulses: Amazon using third-party seller data to inform its own product development, for example, or Apple advertising its many subscriptions throughout the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UVmeX"&gt;But at the risk of sounding incredibly naive about the political process, this is not really the debate we just had during a marathon bill markup session in the judiciary committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="MAmpp9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bbfICS"&gt;The House bills all have Republican co-sponsors, and appear to enjoy some support in that delegation. But key Republicans have so far refused to engage with any of these bills on a policy level, insisting instead that tech reform begin (and possibly end?) with prohibitions on “censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhVmGk"&gt;Galled by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22519073/facebook-trump-ban-2-year-oversight-board-decision-political-figures-newsworthiness"&gt;the removal of former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms, and perhaps energized by Florida’s recent passage of a (likely unconstitutional) bill that would make such content moderation illegal, some Republicans want to throw out the entire process. Members of Congress in this camp include the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Rep. Jim Jordan, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvyBlQ"&gt;This piece from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; this week&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/23/gop-infighting-big-tech-crackdown-495605"&gt; gives you some flavor of the discussion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="as99kf"&gt;Jordan has been &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/big-tech-big-government-democrat-bills-rep-jim-jordan-mark-meadows"&gt;publicly pushing against the bills&lt;/a&gt;, while McCarthy has said he’s planning to unveil his own tech reform agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8r7KH"&gt;“We’ve got a beef with all Big Tech in the sense of the censorship they have of conservatives now,” Jordan told Fox Business on Tuesday. Jordan added, however, that the antitrust bills coming to a vote are sponsored by “four impeachment managers” — questioning top Democrats’ ability to write legislation that conservatives can favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5L3uQD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Republic outrage is rooted in the idea that anyone else might have power over their speech&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb1rOA"&gt;Set aside for a moment the fact that Trump was removed from these platforms because he was using them in an effort to overturn the results of a fair election, the thing to highlight here is that Republican leadership’s concerns have nothing to do with “competition” per se. Instead, their outrage is rooted in the idea that anyone else might have power over their speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRHteu"&gt;We know what happens when elected officials are allowed to post whatever they want online — they attack minorities, they manufacture influence operations against their own citizens, they chip away at the foundations of democracy. (This has been&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/india-censors-the-platforms"&gt; the story in India&lt;/a&gt; for the past year, and if you assume it is a preview of the next Republican administration here in the United States, as I do, it’s quite chilling.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oow9Q7"&gt;For these Republicans, then, the goal is not actually to make platforms like Facebook and Twitter less powerful — it’s to ensure that they can use those platforms’ power to achieve their own ends, and to make it illegal for anyone to stop them. When Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464930/donald-trump-blog-facebook-twitter-social-media-platform"&gt;shut down his blog&lt;/a&gt; 29 days after starting it, it wasn’t in protest of platforms’ power — it was out of the frustration that he no longer had access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJblk"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; story and other reporting on the subject suggests that Democrats will struggle to find 10 Republicans in the Senate to sign on to most of these bills, and perhaps to any but the one providing extra funding for antitrust enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnyyPA"&gt;For as long as the parties have spent agreeing that somebody ought to do something about Big Tech, in important ways they are still talking past one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="K8EEhU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NDzsyn"&gt;I mean, the Democrats aren’t exactly all in agreement, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8muE9X"&gt;There is a split between progressive and moderate Democrats in just how far these bills should go to reshape the economy. And some bills go quite far — Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s Ending Platform Monopolies Act would permit the government to sue big platforms to break them up — Amazon could be forced to divest itself of its logistics network and of Amazon Web Services, for example; Facebook could have to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzXQpw"&gt;That has made some Democrats uneasy, as&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/23/democrats-tech-antitrust-package-495644"&gt; Leah Nylen and Cristiano Lima reported Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yy0bDy"&gt;A growing number of moderate Democrats are also voicing concern about the proposals under consideration this week, which they warn could have a vast impact on the U.S. economy. That includes at least two key California Democrats that sit on Judiciary, Zoe Lofgren and Lou Correa, who will have a say Wednesday on which bills make it out of the panel and which don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2k3Pw"&gt;“My concern is that this legislation will essentially push away investment in this area, it will stifle the economics behind it, the job creation,” Correa, whose district includes parts of Orange County, said in an interview Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FGme2E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Congress has little to say about the specifics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dV2zKd"&gt;I think these concerns are fair? It’s remarkable that, after years of deliberations, we still don’t know exactly how the government would proceed if these bills became law. Would they sue each platform simultaneously and force them to divest most of their acquisitions? Would they begin new, more targeted investigations of the platforms before they acted? And what would the platforms look like after they were through?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV0Duq"&gt;A coalition of advocacy groups, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/heres-who-funds-the-tech-think-tanks-asking-congress-to-1847142650"&gt;most supported by the big tech platforms&lt;/a&gt;, wrote in a letter to Congress that: “Rep. Cicilline’s bill would ban Google from displaying YouTube videos in search results; ban Alexa users from ordering goods from Amazon; block Apple from preinstalling ‘Find My Phone’ and iCloud on the iPhone; ban Xbox’s Games Store from coming with the Xbox; and ban Instagram stories from Facebook’s news feed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z06bXF"&gt;Those would represent enormous changes to the economy, and yet Congress — which rarely discusses individual products when talking about these issues — has little to say about the specifics. Given that consumers generally do love all these products, that seems risky and ill advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BClXp"&gt;I am trying not to be a regulatory nihilist here. Like I said, I think aspects of these bills could do some good. I hope the FTC and DOC get more funding. I hope Apple enables&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90649203/apple-iphone-sideloading-safety-apps-tech"&gt; sideloading&lt;/a&gt; on iOS, whether or not Congress forces it to. I hope future mergers get more scrutiny, particularly those related to next-generation platforms, rather than last-generation ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J04z0o"&gt;But two big concerns hang over everything else here. One is that in a Congress where a small handful of Republicans can derail almost anything, there are seemingly more than enough here to stop most of what has been presented in its tracks. And two is that as grateful as I am for the bipartisan group’s work here, it’s hard to shake the feeling that they both took too long to act &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bit off more than they can chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdT50I"&gt;A member of the bipartisan group, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), called the package of bills “a scalpel, not a chainsaw, to deal with the most important aspects of antitrust reform.” But it sure looks like a chainsaw to me. And before Congress revs it up much more, Americans may want to consider exactly what their representatives are proposing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbMO4S"&gt;The representatives ought to consider it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ctuM26"&gt;
&lt;p id="pEjYP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBx5Oa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc5diV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s security changes will break old Drive and YouTube links</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DPqn7pgqUPbpiN9Y4RaXCh3HHxk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496917/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9cJPxF"&gt;Soon, public links to an untold number of items stored on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10685032"&gt;Google Drive &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/114633828/changes-to-unlisted-videos-uploaded-before-2017?hl=en"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; will stop working. In the name of enhanced security, Google is changing the way it handles link sharing on both services, and while active users may be able to opt out of the switch, files and videos abandoned on unused or inactive accounts may simply slip out of view forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ56YG"&gt;That’s because shared links are now part of a newer system that Google says increases security. On YouTube, the newer links are apparently more difficult for anyone to guess or access without being explicitly given access. The newer links also have the affect of tying more activity to specific accounts and requiring viewers to log in, which allows access to be tracked and made a part of each user’s profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLC4nY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6UHS1-vDMM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ulRrhG"&gt;On YouTube the changes will affect any videos that are public, but marked as “Unlisted.” As &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-youtube-unlisted-links"&gt;described in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6UHS1-vDMM"&gt;five-minute video&lt;/a&gt;, any Unlisted videos that were uploaded prior to 2017 will have their status changed to Private starting on July 23rd. The way Private videos work now, that will kill any old links or embeds, plus it limits sharing to a maximum of 50 people — all of whom will need a Google account to view it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkDAUa"&gt;For people who would prefer to keep sharing their old Unlisted videos with public links, embeds and comments, they can opt out on a per-account basis by &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/older_unlisted_update"&gt;filling out this form&lt;/a&gt; over the next month. The only other option is to reupload those videos and leave them marked as Unlisted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5q81m"&gt;Google Drive is going through the same change, as announced earlier today &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/06/drive-file-link-updates.html"&gt;on the Workspace Updates blog&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking a link to access cloud-stored files will now include a resource key that determines who does or does not get access. If you’ve already accessed a file (presumably while logged in to your Google account) then you will continue to have access to it, and if you have “direct access,” then that will continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Drive security update email" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fyq03_XvuEyfAHSmvK0mkF5ezPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678103/drive_security_update_email.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Drive security update email&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2Aitkd"&gt;If that is not the case, then you’ll need to make a request to access the file or folder. If you have a personal Google/Gmail account and use Drive, then you’ll get an email after July 26th alerting you to any files that will be impacted by this change. If your account includes links that will be affected, then you’ll be able to opt out of the “security update” as long as you do so before September 13th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6RYMR"&gt;If you use a Google Workspace account managed by your employer, school or other organization then it’s a little more complicated. &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10685032"&gt;The administrator/IT department can choose&lt;/a&gt; to opt out entirely, apply the update to everyone with no opt-out possible, or apply the update and allow individual users to remove it from specific files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhXBo1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVq5eH"&gt;According to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will sell an iPhone with a 6.7-inch screen for less than $900 in 2022 (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/kuo-2022-iphones-could-feature-under-display-touch-id-lowest-price-ever-for-6-7-inch-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If this turns out to be the case, iPhone 14 buyers will have a less expensive way to get a screen size that Apple currently only sells on the 12 Pro Max, which starts at $1,099. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKs7gA"&gt;Kuo predicts that Apple’s 2022 non-pro iPhone lineup includes phones with 6.1 and 6.7-inch screens (the same sizes as the current iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, respectively). Absent is the iPhone Mini with its 5.4-inch screen. Analysts, including Kuo, have said that the Mini will be going away in 2022 due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322843/iphone-12-mini-apple-low-production-numbers-decrease"&gt;reportedly low sales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOFORJ"&gt;While some may mourn the loss of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus"&gt;an actually small phone option&lt;/a&gt;, from Apple’s perspective, going big with its line of mainstream phones makes sense. We know from documents unearthed in the Epic v. Apple trial that Apple commissioned a report on the smartphone purchasing habits of consumers late last year. The report showed both that many customers were buying phones that had screens larger than six inches and that more people were turning to Samsung than Apple for their big phone needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cp_Grsgbx--DQMHTv8awM5dW7L4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22678069/apple_charts.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charts from the report showing the screen size breakdown for phones sold and average price points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cb9O4E"&gt;Both companies face &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166399/iphone-android-apple-samsung-smartphone-sales-peak"&gt;a market that is slowing down&lt;/a&gt;, and one that is having to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18263584/why-phones-are-so-expensive-price-apple-samsung-google"&gt;grapple with rising costs&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple has made the decision to make a lower-end big phone, it’s done so after seeing the research that many consumers want phones that are both bigger, and cheaper. While Apple has somewhat been working toward that goal (the iPhone 12, 11, and XR have all had 6.1-inch screens), it’s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end — next year could be its time to court users who want something bigger than 6.1-inches, but don’t want to spend over $1,000 to get it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fxKBtV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s generally kept the really big phones at the high-end&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ncmGUf"&gt;In addition to his prediction about the lower-end 6.7-inch iPhone, &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Kuo said the 2022 iPhones will have under-display fingerprint readers, and that there will be a new &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/23/kuo-new-iphone-se-with-5g-and-new-processor-still-on-track-for-first-half-of-2022/"&gt;iPhone SE with 5G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYDTyc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: We previously stated the iPhone 12 mini had a 5.7-inch screen, but it has a 5.4-inch screen. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA confirms Battlefield 2042 will use bots to help fill its 128-player servers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jw40PUjVs-1Xw_nm6w3wIc2ufI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496488/RevealScreenshot_15_VistaBorderline_3840x2160_NoLogo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kE0Czy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, coming this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524753/battlefield-2042-release-date-trailer-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc"&gt;will offer the series’ largest skirmishes yet&lt;/a&gt;; its “All-Out Warfare” modes can fit 128 simultaneous players in a single match on PS5, Xbox Series X and PC. But you won’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have 128 humans in each match — EA will be backfilling those servers with bots to keep games populated, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s currently no plan to let you turn that off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AcOSY"&gt;Humans will take priority, so you might never encounter an AI soldier at peak playtimes — and if you truly hate bots, you’ll be able to play other modes. But the main event allows up to 64 “AI soldiers” to help fill a game, depending on your region, platform, and how many real-life humans are available to join up. That applies to both the Conquest and Breakthrough modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TnZMl0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In defense of bots (assuming the bots are any good)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbShwT"&gt;It’s sure to be a polarizing decision, but I think it might be a smart one, considering the alternatives. It’s risky to build a game around 128 simultaneous players (64 players on PS4 and Xbox One), when you never know how long your multiplayer game might be able to keep users around. I wish EA had competent bots in 2014 when it released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/12/5402862/titanfall-preview"&gt;the original &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a 6v6 game that died far too soon because of all the ways it divided its playerbase (across Xbox and PC, across game modes, and with iffy matchmaking), and it wasn’t long before my buddies and I couldn’t find a decent match on PC at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo1aP9"&gt;MAG, a PS3 game that supported 256-player battles way back in 2010, actually &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-add-bot-support-to-mag-2"&gt;inspired a petition to &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; bots to the game&lt;/a&gt;. And EA’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Battlefront &lt;/em&gt;reboots &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/battlefront/star-wars-battlefront-2/news/ai-article-deep-dive"&gt;used bots alongside players&lt;/a&gt; to enhance &lt;a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/its-not-a-campaign-but-at-least-battlefront-has-bots-now/"&gt;particular modes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgiDZX"&gt;(I also wonder whether &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; in particular might be a better game with particularly smart and loyal bots? Played properly as a team, it’s one of my favorite gaming experiences, but I’ve seen so many matches derailed by players who seem to enjoy repeatedly crashing jets into the ground.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="U5vA3I"&gt;We don’t yet know whether &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042’&lt;/em&gt;s bots will be any &lt;em&gt;good, &lt;/em&gt;of course, and everything will hinge on that. I certainly couldn’t tolerate &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/pubg-is-dying-how-bots-threaten-to-destroy-playerunknowns-battlegrounds"&gt;the ones that appeared in PUBG&lt;/a&gt;, which have reportedly since been toned down. EA’s bots might be a work in progress too: “The game is still in development and the use of AI will be tuned as player data comes in,” the company notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CEJHwB"&gt;EA says it should have more info soon on how the new bots will work. If you like them, you’ll be able to see more of them if you want: while &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042 &lt;/em&gt;won’t have a single-player campaign, you’ll be able to play &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/06/13/battlefield-2042-preview-a-true-turning-point-for-the-fps-franchise"&gt;any map and any game mode&lt;/a&gt; solo against a team of bots, or bring along your friends to battle in a co-op mode. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s improved Combo Touch keyboard will be available for the fourth-gen iPad Air in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxqS1UL0ZIZ3XuVGNFE20_03YFo=/0x201:1080x921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496407/Combo_Touch_for_iPad_Air_Oxford_Grey_Beautiful_Design_Enviro_1080x1080.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Combo Touch case.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iE98Y1"&gt;Logitech is releasing a version of its Combo Touch keyboard case, which has a Microsoft Surface-style kickstand and a detachable keyboard with an integrated trackpad, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.logitech.com%2F2021%2F06%2F23%2Flogitech-announces-combo-touch-for-ipad-air-and-new-color%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22547938%2Flogitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for the fourth-generation iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;. The case will cost $199.99, making it $100 cheaper than Apple’s Magic Keyboard that fits the iPad Air, and it will be available in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y92CD4"&gt;The Combo Touch’s keyboard is powered by the iPad’s Smart Connector, meaning that you won’t need to charge up the keyboard on its own, and it offers backlit keys and iPadOS shortcut keys. The case also a handy open spot at the top where you can store a second-gen Apple Pencil, which attaches magnetically to the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpBqDE"&gt;This case’s design might feel familiar — it looks nearly identical to the Combo Touch cases that were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395219/logitech-combo-touch-keyboard-new-ipad-pro"&gt;recently released for the 2021 iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;. It also seems like it will be an upgrade from the version of the Combo Touch that fits the third-generation iPad Air — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231088/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-keyboard-trackpad-case-review-price-specs-features"&gt;and my colleague Phil Esposito already liked that case a lot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7DC8y"&gt;Speaking of the Combo Touch for the iPad Pros, Logitech is also introducing a new “sand” color (I’d describe it as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fipad-keyboards%2Fcombo-touch-ipad.html%3Fcrid%3D1762%23buy-combo-touch-ipad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22547938%2Flogitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a light gray&lt;/a&gt;) that will also be available in July.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JESJIAZbpsRlslH85lLB92oWP7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69496210/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fi4TH7"&gt;One of tech’s biggest problems in the past few months has been due to one of its smallest components: chips. Months into the shortage, the effects have spread far beyond the difficulty of buying an Xbox Series X or PS5. Car companies are being hit the worst, and even &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;home appliances&lt;/a&gt; might start to see issues with supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oliYeU"&gt;Earlier this year, companies expected to have supply chains sorted and products more consistently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints"&gt;back on shelves by summer&lt;/a&gt; — but June is nearly over and there’s seemingly no end in sight. And with the upcoming slate of big tech releases and the holiday shopping season coming up, expect things to get worse before they get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8jotJ"&gt;“We had thought probably six or seven months ago, like everybody else, that it would be relatively short-term.” Jahmy Hindman, chief technology officer at John Deere, commented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;on The Verge’s &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “But I think we’re into this for the next 12 to 18 months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bmSk8R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chips could be in short supply for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSWfIj"&gt;It’s not just tractors and trucks, though. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger voiced similar sentiment, commenting in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-earnings-first-quarter-2021-11619043954"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; back in April that it could be two years before production is able to ramp up. “This will take a while until people can put more capacity in the ground.” And AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/chip-shortage-causes-amd-to-pivot-away-from-lower-end-pc-processors"&gt;noted at a May investor event&lt;/a&gt; that the company was being forced to prioritize its higher end chips over lower-powered parts due to shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpT1Lt"&gt;There’s two different forces at work here. For some products, there’s too much demand, which impacts the higher-end chips like the GPUs in a PlayStation 5 or an RTX 3080 graphics card. While chip shortages have undoubtedly played a part, there’s also simply more people who want to buy these products than there are enough to go around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t4Jm2S"&gt;Take the PS5, for instance, which is the &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-17-ps5-the-fastest-selling-console-in-us-history"&gt;fastest selling console in US history&lt;/a&gt; despite the continued difficulty in purchasing one months after its launch. “Even if we secure a lot more devices and produce many more units of the PlayStation 5 next year, our supply wouldn’t be able to catch up with demand,” Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki said in a private analyst briefing, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-10/sony-warns-tight-playstation-5-supply-to-extend-into-next-year"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JoP3av"&gt;Or take GPUs, which have &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3138130/bitcoin-crackdown-sends-graphics-cards-prices-plummeting-china-after"&gt;finally started to drop in price&lt;/a&gt; over the past few weeks — not because Nvidia has magically figured out how to churn out more parts, but because demand is finally slowing down following plummeting Bitcoin prices and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aSuly"&gt;It’s in chipmakers’ interests to keep trying to churn out those parts: newer chips are more lucrative. If you’re TSMC or Samsung, it’s in your best interest to focus on making (and expanding) those production efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZ0U0H"&gt;On the flip side, though, are supply issues, particularly for older chip designs. Unlike a new iPhone or Xbox, a Ford truck or a John Deere tractor doesn’t need bleeding-edge chips using TSMC or Samsung’s 5nm process. They use older chips, which are less powerful (and less pricey) than ones using brand new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LDuK9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Older chips — like the ones used in cars — are being hit particularly hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUeMSE"&gt;The impact here is already being felt. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/chip-shortage-forces-carmakers-to-strip-out-high-tech-features?srnd=premium-europe&amp;amp;amp;sref=ctSjKj2N"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from last month notes that carmakers are starting to skip out on offering premium features like navigation systems or extra screens in order to stretch their supply of chips further. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;Nvidia repurposed old GPUs&lt;/a&gt; into special cryptocurrency mining boards to free up more supply of newer ones for gamers. Even Apple noted that it was running into trouble getting ahold of those older chips, due to the extra competition. “Most of our issue is on licensing those legacy nodes, there are many different people not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes,” Cook said in Apple’s Q2 earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLy76S"&gt;Revathi Advaithi, CEO of Flex — the world’s third largest electronics manufacturing company — noted a similar issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451309/flex-revathi-advaithi-interview-decoder-manufacturing-covid-19"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “Automotive semiconductors have been pretty outdated,” she explains, noting that automakers either have to invest in upgrading to newer technologies more on par with consumer devices, or foundries need to build out more capacity for those specific legacy chips — parts which aren’t really useful for phones or laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWVuHy"&gt;Exacerbating the issue is that on a broader scale, the semiconductor industry has become increasingly consolidated. Despite the increasing importance of computer chips in virtually every hardware product across multiple industries, the number of companies that make those chips — especially specialized chips at the high end of the market — have grown increasingly fewer in number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsR2Az"&gt;TSMC alone accounts for 92 percent of the supply of cutting-edge chips, with Samsung providing the rest, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;according to a&lt;em&gt; Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. The company also reportedly makes about 60 percent of the chips for car manufacturers around the world. Which means that when those companies run out of capacity, there’s not a lot of other places to go to get those processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyl6s4"&gt;That’s also why chip shortages likely won’t hit some of the biggest devices, like Apple’s next iPhone or whatever Samsung’s fall flagship ends up being, at least not as hard as they hit Ford trucks or GPUs. &lt;a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210621PD212.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digitimes&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that TSMC is already &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;prioritizing Apple’s orders&lt;/a&gt; (along with those of car manufacturers) heading into the fall. Because of the size and scale of Apple’s orders — think of how many iPhones it sells every year, all using cutting-edge chips from TSMC — it has the pull to stay at the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04dBvl"&gt;The bad news is that the crunch will probably get worse before it gets better. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung are all heavily investing in expanding and building new fabs. The Biden administration is also trying to help, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;pushing to pump billions into US semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;. But as Intel’s CEO noted, it’ll take months, if not a few years, for those investments to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JkcgD"&gt;And with the holiday season fast approaching and a new wave of products from across market segments all fighting for chips, there’s almost certainly bound to be more product delays, cut corners, price jumps, and part shortages to come. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John McAfee found dead in Barcelona prison, authorities say</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zlm5ym"&gt;John McAfee, founder of the company behind McAfee Antivirus, has been found dead according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/john-mcafee-found-dead-prison-after-spanish-court-allows-extradition-2021-06-23/"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2021/06/23/60d38594e4d4d8c47b8b4699.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Mundo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://elpais.com/economia/2021-06-23/el-fundador-del-antivirus-mcafee-john-mcafee-se-suicida-en-una-prision-de-barcelona.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El País&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and others. He was being held in a Barcelona prison, and the Catalan Department of Justice has stated that his death was likely caused by suicide. Lawyers for McAfee confirmed his death to &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/business/john-mcafee-dead.html"&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with one saying&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it was “the result of a cruel system that had no reason to keep this man in jail for so long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XcpY7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXvvlL"&gt;McAfee was being held in prison, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion"&gt;pending extradition to the US&lt;/a&gt;, since his arrest in October 2020. He faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503324/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion-sued-doj-sec"&gt;charges of tax evasion&lt;/a&gt; and had also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315494/john-mcafee-fraud-securities-scheme-charges-cryptocurrency"&gt;been charged with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt; relating to an alleged cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme. Spanish courts had approved his extradition this morning with opportunity for appeal, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/spain-high-court-allows-john-mcafees-extradition-us-2021-06-23/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2021/06/23/60d34ebce4d4d8ca7b8b4664.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;El Mundo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5xhC1"&gt;McAfee’s story over the past decade has been headline-grabbing. He’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/19/4444266/john-mcafee-youtube-how-to-uninstall-mcafee-antivirus"&gt;released a drug-fueled video&lt;/a&gt; in which he un-installs McAfee Antivirus, claimed to have made a device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/30/4786008/john-mcafee-d-central-device-avoid-nsa-private-network"&gt;that blocked NSA surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2018/06/04/john-mcafee-president-2020/"&gt;run for president&lt;/a&gt; — twice, in 2016 and 2020. He’s also a noted cryptocurrency promoter, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189880/john-mcafee-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-twitter-ico"&gt;once claimed to charge $105,000&lt;/a&gt; for each promotional tweet, if you wanted McAfee to boost your cryptocurrency or initial coin offering on Twitter’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAP7Jn"&gt;In 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5282618/intel-phases-out-mcafee-brand-name-distancing-itself-from"&gt;Intel rebranded the antivirus software&lt;/a&gt; that bore McAfee’s name, changing it to “Intel Security.” In response, McAfee told the BBC that he was grateful that “the worst software on the planet” was no longer associated with his name. McAfee later sued Intel after it warned him that naming a new cybersecurity company after himself would be trademark infringement. McAfee &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mcafee-settlement/intel-john-mcafee-settle-lawsuits-over-antivirus-pioneers-name-idUSKBN19Q31Y"&gt;later agreed to a settlement with Intel&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he wouldn’t use his name in connection to any cybersecurity products or services he worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7Pm0Z"&gt;McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement. He, his family, and members of his security forces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2998762/john-mcafee-belize-police-wrongful-arrest"&gt;were arrested by the Belize police&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, after drug and firearm charges. He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/5/3734178/mcafee-arrest-murder-investigation"&gt;went on the run later that year&lt;/a&gt;, after the Belize police declared that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3636412/john-mcafee-questioning-murder-investigation-belize"&gt;was wanted for questioning&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the murder of his neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y54PJN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwv3KH"&gt;The story became one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/14/12904402/john-mcafee-rape-murder-accusations-gringo-documentary-tiff-interview"&gt;focuses of a 2016 Showtime documentary&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to prove that McAfee was involved not only in that murder, but other crimes as well. &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/john-mcafee-wont-pay-25m-judgment-in-wrongful-death-case-has-ignored-all-lawsuits-for-11-years/"&gt;As recently as 2019&lt;/a&gt;, McAfee called the case against him “frivolous,” and refused to pay a $25 million judgement against him in a wrongful death suit. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1108191328515571713"&gt;also claimed&lt;/a&gt; that he had over $200 million in judgements against him in other legal cases, but that he could not pay any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uU5bZ"&gt;In recent years, McAfee claimed to be on the run from the CIA, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1152240931015462914"&gt;tweeting a picture of himself&lt;/a&gt; on a boat holding a gun. McAfee has also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1200864283766251521"&gt;tweeted multiple times&lt;/a&gt;, once &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1316801215083225096"&gt;after his October arrest&lt;/a&gt;, that he wouldn’t kill himself, and those tweets are already leading to conspiracy theories about his death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj4Ntd"&gt;The US Department of Justice tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has no comment on the matter, referring us to Spanish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3d5OT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacock is finally coming to Fire TV on June 24th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y8JWDJqnUIqQEaZ327qew25XusU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495410/peacock_channels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Peacock app displayed on a TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFl6Vy"&gt;Nearly a year after Peacock’s launch, NBCUniversal’s marquee streaming app is finally coming to Fire TV and Fire tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06dPGl"&gt;The streaming service will officially arrive on Amazon devices on June 24th, allowing users to access the app without having to sideload it. The companies announced Wednesday that the app would be supported across Fire TV products, including Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV smart TVs. A Peacock spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that second-generation Fire TVs and above will have support for the app, as will all Fire Tablets with Fire OS 5 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Anzodc"&gt;In addition to Peacock, the distribution agreement will see 15 NBCUniversal apps arrive on Amazon devices as well, including various NBC apps and Telemundo. Much of Peacock’s content is available to stream for free, but users can unlock more content and originals with either of the service’s paid tiers. Peacock’s premium ad-supported tier costs $5 per month, while its ad-free experience costs $10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37X3cT"&gt;Support for the app will give streamers access not only to NBCUniversal’s catalog of network programming — including popular series like &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&lt;/em&gt; — but also to coverage of various sporting events. These include Sunday Night Football, the Tokyo Olympics, and, because Peacock has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319438/wwe-network-peacock-features-price-faq-deal"&gt;exclusive rights&lt;/a&gt; to the WWE Network, SummerSlam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdaCbT"&gt;Previously, Fire TV users who’d hoped to access event coverage exclusive to the service would either have to find another way to stream it or sideload it themselves — something Peacock itself &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeacockTVCare/status/1374376982759108608"&gt;previously encouraged&lt;/a&gt; its frustrated users to try as a workaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYUXaZ"&gt;When support arrives tomorrow, Fire TV users will be able to open and search the service’s catalog using voice commands. The companies said that later this year, users will get further Alexa support and the ability to surf Peacock using an Alexa Voice Remote, a Fire TV Cube, or by pairing an Echo device to a Fire TV smart TV or streaming stick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jerry Seinfeld’s Pop-Tarts obsession is turning into a Netflix movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comedians In Cars w. Jerry Seinfeld &amp;amp;amp; Eddie Murphy ‑ LA Tastemaker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8FBCO64F48gR0CWxTDHR_qGxWFw=/0x0:2944x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69495243/1162827726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fzQ9wD"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld is perhaps best known for co-writing and starring in &lt;em&gt;Bee Movie &lt;/em&gt;(fine, also for co-creating one of the most beloved televised sitcoms). But since that daring project, he hasn’t really returned to feature-length films. That’s about to change — &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/06/jerry-seinfeld-netflix-movie-deal-unfrosted-creation-of-pop-tart-directing-starring-cowriter-1234780032/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/jerry-seinfeld-pop-tart-movie-netflix-unfrosted-1235003638/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report that Seinfeld is co-writing, directing, producing, and starring in &lt;em&gt;Unfrosted&lt;/em&gt;, a new film about the origins of Pop-Tarts, for Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t0WvK"&gt;Seinfeld’s fascination with the toaster pastry is well-documented, featuring the breakfast food &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmCTUBEluSE"&gt;in his stand-up&lt;/a&gt; and in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itWxXyCfW5s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;video interview&lt;/a&gt; on joke writing. Seinfeld is penning this film exploration alongside Spike Feresten and Barry Marder — two of &lt;em&gt;Bee Movie&lt;/em&gt;’s co-writers — using the classic stand-up bit as a jumping off point. Will it be a humorous spin on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14322100/founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds-ray-kroc-movie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Founder&lt;/em&gt;-style origin story&lt;/a&gt;? Hard to say, but clearly Seinfeld has thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zFSOZD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmCTUBEluSE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iP0CsB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfrosted&lt;/em&gt; has been shopped around for the last few days according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;, but Seinfeld’s existing relationship with Netflix is what helped seal the deal. Besides featuring the comedian’s modern stand-up specials, Netflix also secured the rights to Seinfeld’s popular interview show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/17/14304790/jerry-seinfeld-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee-netflix-crackle-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&lt;/em&gt; in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and will be the go-to location for anyone looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20868736/seinfeld-netflix-2021-hulu-friends-streaming-wars"&gt;to binge old &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt; episodes later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRYjO3"&gt;This is definitely another example of Netflix reinvesting in the relationships with comedy talent it’s been cultivating for the last several years (see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21116858/adam-sandler-netflix-deal-four-movies-murder-mystery-most-viewed-2019"&gt;Adam Sandler’s Netflix-based streaming empire&lt;/a&gt;), but it also just seems like the kind of goofy film idea that could only get greenlit in the heady excesses of our current streaming era. &lt;/p&gt;
