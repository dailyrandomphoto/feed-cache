    <title>Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s web source code NFT sells for $5.4 million</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iv2I9E"&gt;The latest mega-auction of an NFT tied to a piece of internet history is complete, with Sir Tim Berners-Lee selling a digital item representing source code to the original web browser &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fthis-changed-everything-source-code-for-www-x-tim-berners-lee-an-nft%2Fsource-code-for-the-www&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557765%2Fwww-nft-tim-berners-lee-sothebys-source-code" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $5,434,500&lt;/a&gt;. Berners-Lee is credited as the creator of the world wide web that this site is published on, and the NFT includes a time-stamped signed archive including 10,000 lines of the source code that initially made it possible to display an HTML document, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UANWj"&gt;For comparison, the highest price for an NFT remains the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327594/metakovan-beeple-highest-auction-price-69-million-nft"&gt;$69 million or so MetaKovan paid to own &lt;em&gt;Everydays: the First 5000 Days&lt;/em&gt; by the artist Beeple&lt;/a&gt;, while Jack Dorsey’s digital collectible representing the first tweet on Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter"&gt;sold for a little less than $3 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;div id="wBFnYK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="blJHMO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m selling a picture that I made, with a Python programme that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7OP1iF"&gt;After the auction was announced, there was some backlash to the plan, whether due to general unease over NFTs, environmental concerns, or otherwise. Berners-Lee and his wife say they will use the proceeds to benefit causes they support. In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, Berners-Lee said “This is totally aligned with the values of the web ... I’m selling a picture that I made, with a Python programme that I wrote myself, of what the source code would look like if it was stuck on the wall and signed by me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFuWWz"&gt;According to a condition report &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sothebys.com%2Fen%2Fbuy%2Fauction%2F2021%2Fthis-changed-everything-source-code-for-www-x-tim-berners-lee-an-nft%2Fsource-code-for-the-www&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557765%2Fwww-nft-tim-berners-lee-sothebys-source-code" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;listed along with the NFT&lt;/a&gt; by Sothebys, the data security of this particular item is “very high.” For owners of NFTs worried about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;potentially losing their multimillion dollar purchase due to servers going down or link rot&lt;/a&gt;, the platform they’ve used  says it includes both Arweave and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k42mnj"&gt;The only remaining issue may be the collectible itself, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikko/status/1410191059481673730"&gt;some have noted&lt;/a&gt; that while the archived code is intact, the video included in the purchase renders angle brackets incorrectly. It won’t stop you from compiling an early-’90s web browser of your own (non-millionaires can experience that glory &lt;a href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for free), but it is an unwelcome smudge on such a high-priced item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkcPL2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktub7U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that it is fully compliant with the FCC’s new anti-spoofing protocol, telling the FCC that its now certifying that calls from its network are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;protected against impersonation by scam callers&lt;/a&gt; using the STIR/SHAKEN protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kh04"&gt;Verizon &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s verifying that the number that shows up on your caller ID is actually the number that’s calling you, using the same STIR/SHAKEN protocol. The two major carriers announcing their progress on the same day isn’t a coincidence — Wednesday, June 30th, is the deadline the FCC set for major carriers to implement STIR/SHAKEN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wo2aX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The protocol works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="31Lb2O"&gt;The protocol, with its James Bond-themed name, works to prevent scam and spam callers from spoofing their number and showing up on your caller ID as a local caller. The FCC hopes that carriers implementing it will help stem the tide of robocalls that have made many of us scared of our phones’ actual phone function. &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;In a press release put out on Wednesday (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, the commission stated that over 1,500 voice providers have filed to be included in its Robocall Mitigation Database, with over 200 of those providers being fully certified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4obFxo"&gt;The Wednesday deadline set by the FCC is only for major carriers — smaller carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers will be exempt until June 30th, 2023, though the FCC &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf"&gt;is considering shortening that timespan (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The major carriers that haven’t certified themselves as compliant may face an unspecified “appropriate enforcement action” from the FCC and will run into even more trouble come September. Beginning September 28th, &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/062199369474/DA-21-727A1.pdf"&gt;according to the FCC (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;, carriers will have to stop accepting traffic from providers that aren’t in the robocall database — it’s hard to imagine customers being too happy that they’re not able to reach their friends or family who are on T-Mobile or Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxxocJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;While this may mean a significant drop in spam calls, it’s not bulletproof&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8AMRWw"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T, the third major carrier in the US, doesn’t seem to have explicitly said that it’s filled for certification for STIR/SHAKEN with the FCC yet. Last week, the carrier put out a press release about blocking over a billion robocalls a month, and &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/fcc-deadline-for-stir-shaken-caller-id-authentication-nears"&gt;it told &lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it intends on meeting the deadline. AT&amp;amp;T did not immediately respond to our request for comment about its certification status today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl16xb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fpress%2Ft-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F30%2F22557539%2Ft-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its press release&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile says that its STIR/SHAKEN network covers calls from 98 percent of US wireless customers, including those using carriers like AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, Google Fi, and Comcast. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon says&lt;/a&gt; that its validation network covers 80 percent of the US wireless industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oH7IG"&gt;The STIR/SHAKEN protocol &lt;a href="https://blog.hiya.com/stir/shaken-does-it-reduce-illegal-call-spoofing"&gt;isn’t a total solution&lt;/a&gt; to the robocall problem, and it won’t keep your phone from ringing when a scammer calls you unless your carrier is doing additional blocking using the data from it. &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/fcc-deadline-for-stir-shaken-caller-id-authentication-nears"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fierce Wireless&lt;/em&gt; also points out&lt;/a&gt; that carriers still have to contend with international calls, which is no small task, and legacy phone systems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201140/fcc-stir-shaken-approved-june-2021-deadline-robocalls"&gt;are exempt from the requirements&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the next time you get a phone call, you may be able to see whether the number that’s calling you is actually who it claims to be. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An intrepid YouTuber created a handheld that runs macOS Big Sur</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7EQYUaNMcI552o163fDNHO60rwY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526150/big_sur.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Iketsj/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3hcbhu"&gt;Have you ever been using a recently updated Mac computer and thought, “Man, I would love to use this operating system with a really tiny keyboard and a really tiny screen?” Okay, me neither, but I certainly would love the opportunity to carry a MacBook around in my pocket and whip it out on command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OD6MQ8"&gt;Apparently, YouTuber Ike T. Sanglay Jr., or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS6wGHldCdaA1mtfXWHJ8yA"&gt;Iketsj,”&lt;/a&gt; has had this thought as well. In this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdsdrqA-50"&gt;eight-minute vlog&lt;/a&gt;, the YouTuber builds a tiny handheld PC that can run macOS Big Sur, and it’s very fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s7ETa"&gt;The PC includes a LattePanda Alpha SBC (single board computer) with an Intel Core m3 CPU and 8GB of RAM, as well as an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller board, a 240GB SATA SSD with the operating system preinstalled, and a 3D-printed case (of course). Watch as Sanglay winds cables, cleans screens, cuts screws, and plugs things into ports. The device comes together slowly but surely, to the tune of some serene music that’s much catchier than a YouTube background tune has any business being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibqp2v"&gt;Sanglay eventually boots the thing up, and sure enough, macOS Big Sur is there. The battery indicator doesn’t appear to be working, but the interface otherwise seems fully operational in the limited footage we see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7QsU4"&gt;Now, does this device have a real purpose in the working world? Probably not, and its creator admits as much. “Maybe you’ll say that the handheld macOS is not practical, yada yada yada. Well, sure, you’re right. I just want to make one for myself,” Sanglay notes on camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgsyoK"&gt;The YouTuber is also fully aware that the price of the parts required for this stunt comes out to more than the price of an actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;M1 Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt;. “I know, but where’s the fun in that?” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJDT8v"&gt;Still, as someone who’s long been an advocate of macOS in more creative and portable form factors, I am all in favor. While I can’t imagine actually using macOS on a screen this small, I love the idea of being able to carry its powerful functionality around in such a small package. Plus, it’s just a cute little device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ak606o"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cdsdrqA-50?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=305&amp;amp;start=305" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>SpaceX just launched 88 satellites to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QuWX-AoWqMrTklWUXjh9hy7krco=/281x0:1760x986/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69526138/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_3.53.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UtGCnS"&gt;Dozens of satellites launched to space on Tuesday in SpaceX’s second in-house “ride-share” mission from Florida, bringing the total number of orbital objects carried by Elon Musk’s space company this year to nearly 900. A reused Falcon 9 rocket launched 88 satellites total for the “Transporter-2” mission, including the first five for a new Pentagon agency and dozens more for various companies, countries, and schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbky78"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 3:31PM ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida, marking the company’s 20th launch this year and the eighth flight for the rocket’s first stage booster. That booster returned to Earth about 10 minutes later at SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1, a pad of concrete that hasn’t been used for rocket landings since December; Falcon 9 boosters usually land on sea-faring drone ships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woclbEHTlSLN17OwZaxlo6XD8BY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692173/Jun_30_2021_15_42_40.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rare shot of Falcon 9’s first stage booster as it readies for a vertical landing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SovgDn"&gt;Meanwhile, the carpool of 88 satellites was pushed toward a sun-synchronous, pole-to-pole Earth orbit by Falcon 9’s second-stage booster. Thirty-six tiny satellites were mounted on a new payload adapter built by Spaceflight, a company that books space for small satellites on rockets, alongside other satellites arranged by SpaceX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XpV3w"&gt;This was mission number two for SpaceX’s cost-cutting SmallSat Rideshare Program, which offers tiny satellites rides to space for a starting price of $1 million. Cheaper launch services in the space industry have reinvigorated a market for simple shoebox-sized satellites that have long been forced to hitch rides on larger missions. SpaceX’s ride-share program taps into that growing small satellite market, where companies can offer services ranging from communications to Earth observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUroP1"&gt;The Pentagon’s Space Development Agency (SDA) had five satellites aboard Transporter-2 that will test laser communications between one another in space as well as a separate experiment designed to test in-space data processing (a method that takes time-consuming ground terminals out of the equation). Those two tests support the agency’s goal of eventually communicating with ships and weapons systems faster than ever before. The SDA has two tranches of satellite networks slated to launch in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQ836a"&gt;Other objects on board included a cluster of satellites from geospatial analytics firm HawkEye 360 that will gather radio frequency data and another cluster from radio frequency reconnaissance firm Kleos that will “detect and geolocate maritime radio frequency transmissions” for commercial and government customers. Two nano-satellites from Tyvak, a satellite firm that offers governments optical and remote-sensing services from space, are also on board, though the company declined to say for which agency the satellites will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcfvcBe-kI2NtlZ5mY1K9HZpefE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692109/P6110410.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tyvak’s two nano-satellites sitting in a payload adapter ahead of SpaceX’s Transporter-2 mission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ktyFDn"&gt;The Transporter-2 mission ups the total number of satellites launched by SpaceX since late January to nearly 900 — almost double what the entire world launched in any single year before 2020. The vast majority of those satellites are for SpaceX’s Starlink internet network that’s poised to continue growing throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xMprF"&gt;SpaceX first tried launching Transporter-2 on Tuesday but stopped the countdown clock 11 seconds before liftoff and postponed until Wednesday because a private helicopter entered airspace that was closed off by the Federal Aviation Administration for the mission. Musk called the FAA’s keep-out zone for pilots “unreasonably gigantic” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1409951549988782087?s=20"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; and blasted the agency’s regulations as “broken,” bluntly echoing the same &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/falcon-9-launch-scrub-highlights-airspace-integration-problems/"&gt;long-held grievances&lt;/a&gt; from other space companies and lawmakers who see the FAA’s airspace rules as outdated and inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9kjSy"&gt;The president of the Air Line Pilots Association sided with Musk’s tweet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALPAPresident/status/1409981929181564937?s=20"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;, “We agree that there is a better way and stand ready to work with [SpaceX, FAA], and others to support the safe integration of all national airspace users.” Lawmakers pressed the FAA’s space chief Wayne Monteith on the issue last month during a hearing. He said a new updated system managed by the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization chief operating officer should be ready for operational tests “in the next few months,” following years of development.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation Committee Holds Confirmation Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/921OtduGrYj6pSPoyRHuGFbd2b8=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525849/1232438982.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z3j6q5"&gt;Amazon is pushing back against Lina Khan, the newly confirmed chair of the Federal Trade Commission, by filing a recusal motion against the longtime antitrust advocate, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-lina-khan-in-antitrust-investigations-of-company-11625067962"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The petition asks Khan to restrict herself from any proceedings involving Amazon on the basis of her past statements about the company, including claims that Amazon is a monopoly and should be broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJCMX0"&gt;“[Federal ethics rules] require recusal when a new Commissioner previously has expressed views that go beyond general policy commentary and has made statements about specific factual and legal issues relating to a particular company,” the petition reads. “Chair Khan has made numerous and highly detailed public pronouncements regarding Amazon, including on market definition, specific conduct and theories of harm, and the purpose, effects, and legality of such conduct. Indeed, she has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mSUwsi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Numerous and highly detailed public pronouncements”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AvSyO3"&gt;It’s unlikely that Amazon’s petition will succeed. Recusal petitions against FTC commissioners are rarely successful, and it’s common for an FTC chair to have previously worked for nonprofit groups or as a congressional staffer. The petition highlights an unusually high number of public editorials by Khan, but even those are well within the limits of political commentary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x428oR"&gt;More importantly, Khan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;was confirmed with bipartisan support&lt;/a&gt; specifically because of her influential anti-Amazon views, which are increasingly widely held in Congress. The Senate wants the FTC to push back on Amazon, and Khan’s previous statements about the company are a big part of why she got the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1dS9E"&gt;That doesn’t mean Khan will be able to do everything she wants: the courts are a huge check on the FTC’s power, as the commission just found out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;in its case against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. But with backing from both the White House and Congress, she’s earned the chance to try. The real message of today’s petition is that Amazon will be fighting that agenda every chance they get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uTN7z1"&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s Revvl V Plus 5G offers a huge display and battery with a tiny $199 price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPwSFHkhNKNr8Mf8QgigKb2R2nk=/0x0:1666x1111/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525847/revvl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newest Revvl phone offers 5G, a massive 6.8-inch screen, and a rear-facing triple camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ken1yu"&gt;The year of cheap 5G phones is upon us, and T-Mobile is offering its customers yet another low-cost 5G phone with today’s announcement of the Revvl V Plus 5G. The T-Mobile-branded device will cost $199, with a huge 6.8-inch 1600 x 900 display and 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale first through &lt;a href="https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/revvl-best-budget-smartphones"&gt;Metro by T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; starting on July 12th, with sales through T-Mobile starting on July 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsBwsY"&gt;The Revvl V Plus 5G comes with Android 11 and uses a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor designed with inexpensive 5G phones in mind. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM plus 64GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via microSD. It offers a main 16-megapixel rear-facing camera along with two more unspecified 5-megapixel and 2-megapixel sensors on the back as well as a 16-megapixel selfie camera. There is, of course, 5G connectivity available, and while you won’t get the ultra-fast mmWave flavor (no big loss; it’s hard to find), you do get access to T-Mobile’s more widespread and relatively strong sub-6GHz 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NzrWNz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus Nord N200 5G review: T-Mobile’s best phone under $250","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2PXtdy"&gt;The V Plus 5G undercuts the OnePlus N200 5G — another inexpensive big-screen-big-battery 5G phone — by about $15 to $40, depending on where you buy it. (It’s $216 through T-Mobile and $239 unlocked from OnePlus.) The N200 5G is actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;our current top pick&lt;/a&gt; for T-Mobile customers looking for 5G on the cheap. And while the Revvl offers some similar features at a lower price, it will be hard pressed to match the N200’s very good 1080p 90Hz display. What we can say for sure is that the 5G price of entry continues to drop, and it likely won’t be long before we see 5G devices priced well under $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShcyZS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch’s Watch Parties feature is rolling out to Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PGx-W9wEOMnHE30ccmH7uaW45YU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525666/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9zopfG"&gt;Amazon-owned Twitch is rolling out its Watch Parties feature, which lets streamers host viewing parties for movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime, to Android and iOS, the company announced Wednesday. Watch Parties first launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418599/twitch-watch-party-rollout-global-amazon-prime-video-streaming"&gt;desktop web in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgU6jS"&gt;While Watch Parties are a potentially fun way for Twitch streamers to hang out with their communities, there’s one important catch: only viewers who also have an Amazon Prime or Prime Video subscription &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/watch-parties?language=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Watch_Parties_M4&amp;amp;_branch_match_id=763455050422471806&amp;amp;utm_medium=Help+Page&amp;amp;utm_source=Creator+Updates#join"&gt;can join&lt;/a&gt; the party to watch what’s being shown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEzGAE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Watch Parties are now rolling out on an Android or iOS device near you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To learn more about Watch Parties, including how to host your own, check out the help article at &lt;a href="https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6"&gt;https://t.co/YvqLMCD5c6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5aQC9It02G"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5aQC9It02G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1410285296718028803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRV4aI"&gt;But with the expansion to Android and iOS, Twitch is offering more devices from which streamers can host Watch Parties, meaning you might see more of your favorite creators using the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWnPEr"&gt;Virtual watch parties have become popular due to the pandemic, and other streaming platforms such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Video&lt;/a&gt; have introduced their own watch party features. Apple’s upcoming iOS 15 update will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;add SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, which will let you watch content with other people over FaceTime — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;as long as apps support the feature, that is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood saddled with historic $70 million fine from financial regulators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGDzmfErEDe42eyh9My9T2yo86s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525584/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DtYWLv"&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s fining Robinhood almost $70 million to settle charges over issues it identified with the company’s stock trading service. The authority claims that the financial app company neglected its duty to supervise trades, maintain its own technology, and protect its customers. The fine is the largest in FINRA’s history and Robinhood has agreed to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bF0ubY"&gt;FINRA says since 2016 Robinhood has periodically provided false and misleading information on topics like whether customers were able to place trades on margin (using credit from Robinhood to buy shares), including displaying inaccurate information in its app on how much cash was in customers’ accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pUQ6zZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s lack of customer communication has caused problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J1Get4"&gt;The authority’s announcement doesn’t specifically identify the case, but it does appear to obliquely reference &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273600/robinhood-alex-kearns-wrongful-death-lawsuit-stock-options-trading"&gt;the death of Alex Kearns&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide after finding a negative $730,000 balance in his Robinhood account from unintentional margin trades. Robinhood was sued following Kearns’ death and ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fswlc6"&gt;FINRA also takes issue with Robinhood’s reliance on algorithms to approve customers for options trading and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163048/robinhood-outages-major-2-days-leap-year-investing"&gt;the outages the platform has suffered&lt;/a&gt;, locking customers out of their accounts “during a time of historic market volatility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGmc75"&gt;For those errors and failing to report customer complaints to FINRA, the financial authority is requiring Robinhood to pay a $57 million fine and $12.6 million in restitution to affected customers. Robinhood hasn’t owned up to FINRA’s complaints or denied them, but it did say in a statement that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ji93r2"&gt;We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HRKV8X"&gt;The timing for all of this is pretty poor for Robinhood. While FINRA doesn’t directly take issue with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the company’s role in the rush to buy GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373990/robinhood-ipo-form-regulators-finance"&gt;Robinhood is expected to go public soon&lt;/a&gt;, and a multimillion-dollar fine is kind of a gigantic blemish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igHMqN"&gt;Robinhood is attempting to address some of FINRA’s problems without fully acknowledging them. In &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com"&gt;a company blog post&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday, Robinhood announced it’s expanding its customer support team, planning on offering “enhanced in-app educational resources,” and attempting to address the issues around providing accurate customer information and supervision on trades. Your guess is as good as mine whether that will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNCl5l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wow, there sure are a lot of sports on during the workday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Day Two: The Championships - Wimbledon 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/amO5SgR7v5VcdCDJ_XlFvzvtS-Q=/0x0:3267x2178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525399/1326135110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NfIM2m"&gt;Right now, you could wake up and turn on Wimbledon. By the afternoon, there will be Euro matches. And then, in the evenings, we’ve had some thrillingly chaotic basketball — both men’s and women’s, plus hockey and baseball and the Tour de France. What a time to be alive (and working from home)! Best of all: it’s all streaming, and I think finally, in 2021, we’re in a place where it’s relatively effortless to watch sports without being tethered to the dregs of convoluted cable packages. Is this the golden age of watching sports during the workday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdqC9b"&gt;I mean, I wouldn’t know. Because I, like all staffers at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, am an extremely diligent employee and would never do anything that would distract me throughout the entire workday. Bosses, if you’re reading this, the reason I am not responding to your Slack messages has nothing to do with our secret and very active sports channel. No, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691747/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_12.43.00_PM.png"&gt;I am probably updating Asana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KLEvd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine telling your loved ones “Great news: we now have a trial FuboTV subscription”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="91yi4e"&gt;Besides, though it might be easier than ever, watching sports in 2021 means signing up for a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244771/streaming-services-niche-crunchyroll-ovid-acorn-tv"&gt;confusingly named streaming services&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine telling your loved ones “Great news: we now have a trial FuboTV subscription” and then having to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691784/Screen_Shot_2021_06_30_at_1.03.29_PM.png"&gt;explain what FuboTV is&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bit like Candyman rules. If you say FuboTV three times in your household, your partner leaves you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5n6Qn"&gt;Or it means spending an arm and a leg on YouTube TV, assuming your arm and leg are worth, collectively, $64.99 a month. (Though for the summer, I personally think it would be worth my two remaining limbs given you’ll be able to stream nearly all the sports in one place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="397vFu"&gt;Okay, yes, it’s never been simpler to stream live sports. But this is all moot, because I remain attentive and focused on my work and am absolutely not streaming Euro matches during my Zoom meetings. If you see my eyes drift to the right, know that it is not because the YouTube TV app is open on an iPad propped up beside my laptop. I just have a weird eye thing that happens when a meeting drags on for more than three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Af8i"&gt;And for the co-workers who, earlier this week, heard me mutter “holy shit what the fuck” while I was accidentally unmuted in the middle of a video production call, it had nothing to do with Spain’s keeper whiffing an embarrassingly easy passback and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/06/28/spain-own-goal-euro/"&gt;letting the ball roll into the goal&lt;/a&gt;. No, I was just responding dramatically to, uh, whatever it was that we were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSZIDd"&gt;Since I am explaining myself, let me address a couple other instances: a few weeks back, did I turn in edits to a writer late because I was so enthralled with a Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic French Open semifinal match? The timing may seem coincidental, but those notes came in late because I had a migraine. The migraine just happened to last exactly the amount of time that it took for Nadal and Djokovic to complete what is now considered by many to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ChrissieEvert/status/1403452352091283462"&gt;one of the greatest sets of tennis ever played&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGqXvv"&gt;And during the all-staff meeting, when I was furiously pounding my desk and chanting “COCO! COCO! COCO!” — that had nothing to do with Coco Gauff’s tight first-round Wimbledon victory over Francesca Jones. I merely thought someone had asked me what my favorite Pixar movie was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsgXtP"&gt;Oh, and just a fair warning for later this month. My internet provider has alerted me that they will be doing scheduled maintenance. So my connection might be spotty, and I may be hard to reach, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when+are+the+olympics&amp;amp;oq=when+are+the+olympics&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i131i433l2j0l5j0i131i433j0.2695j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;starting on July 23rd and going through August 8th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VNqnrn"&gt;
&lt;p id="J5fH3r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article called the soccer tournament the EuroCup. It’s the Euros. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maine passes the strongest state facial recognition ban yet</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yCMh9N"&gt;The state of Maine now has the most stringent laws regulating government use of facial recognition in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymjgca"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP1174&amp;amp;item=2&amp;amp;snum=130"&gt;new law&lt;/a&gt; prohibits government use of facial recognition except in specifically outlined situations, with the most broad exception being if police have probable cause that an unidentified person in an image committed a serious crime, or for proactive fraud prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jLTUa"&gt;Since Maine police will not have access to facial recognition, they will be able to ask the FBI and Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) to run these searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHShv9"&gt;Crucially, the law plugs loopholes that police have used in the past to gain access to the technology, like informally &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/secret-emails-reveal-how-washington-state-cops-shared-facial-recognition-tech-db8a799c6de6"&gt;asking other agencies&lt;/a&gt; or third parties to run backchannel searches for them. Logs of all facial recognition searches by the BMV must be created and are designated as public records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtuWAP"&gt;The ACLU trumpeted this new law as a major win for state action to block facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdCcbw"&gt;“Maine is showing the rest of the country what it looks like when we the people are in control of our civil rights and civil liberties, not tech companies that stand to profit from widespread government use of face surveillance technology,” Michael Kebede, a lawyer at the ACLU of Maine, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/maine-enacts-strongest-statewide-facial-recognition-regulations-country"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7nLVC"&gt;The only other state-wide facial recognition law was enacted by Washington in 2020, but many privacy advocates were dissatisfied with the specifics of the law.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The Washington law gives police &lt;a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/story/we-need-face-surveillance-moratorium-not-weak-regulations-concerns-about-sb-6280"&gt;generous carve-outs&lt;/a&gt; to conduct surveillance with the technology and also allows the technology to be used to deny access to services like housing or education enrollment. Notably, it was written by State Senator Joe Nguyen, who is a &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/a-microsoft-employee-literally-wrote-washingtons-facial-recognition-legislation-aab950396927"&gt;current employee of Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sf8cz"&gt;Virginia and Massachusetts legislatures have also banned some police use of facial recognition, but both fall short of regulating the tech in schools and other state agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcsgRp"&gt;Maine’s new law also gives citizens the ability to sue the state if they’ve been unlawfully targeted by facial recognition, which was notably absent from Washington’s regulation. If facial recognition searches are performed illegally, they must be deleted and cannot be used as evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCsKPG"&gt;The law was enacted after passing state legislature and will not require a signature from Maine Governor Janet Mills. It will go into effect on October 1st, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
