    <title>Read the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 developer’s deleted explanation for why you’re getting NFTs</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSC Game World deleted a tweet elaborating why it plans to offer NFTs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GSC Game World&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0SYqpL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; developer GSC Game World posted a now-deleted statement on Twitter elaborating on its widely criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;plans to add NFTs to the game&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the company said it will be using funds earned from the NFTs to help with development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tU5Rsk"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; is truly the biggest and the most complex game we have ever created,” GSC Game World said. “All the funds that we earn during the development process (including the potential income from NFT) will be spent on improving the long-awaited game to make it even better.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXmleqcEh9gVI-BE2T-RBfPtBN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102587/slack_imgs.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GSC Game World&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSC Game World’s now deleted statement addressing its plans to add NFTs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gbYE23"&gt;On Wednesday, the developer revealed it would be partnering with NFT platform DMarket on the virtual items. As part of its NFT plans, GSC Game World said it would be offering NFTs that allowed the owners to become a “metahuman,” or an NPC added to the game in their likeness. In its Thursday update, GSC Game World downplayed the role of those NPCs, saying they “aren’t even involved in the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HonLN"&gt;The company had previously been vague about its other planned NFTs, but GSC Game World shared more information in the deleted statement about what’s to come, acknowledging that after the metahuman, “some of you thought we would go a bit too far from here.” Here’s what’s apparently coming down the pike: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6Za2pb"&gt;We are going to implement (nick)names of the owners on some in-game desks / walls / etc. (please remember it’s a large open world we’re talking about), gloves / tattoos, skins / badges for the multiplayer mode (releasing as a free update after the story campaign) and collectible cards (DMarket platform only, no integration in &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4MvrzB"&gt;The studio ended its Thursday statement by saying, “Please accept our apologies for yesterday’s miscommunication and all the feelings it caused. We know that you wish only the best for our game, and we appreciate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD5dDI"&gt;GSC Game World didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the deleted statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqh4zw"&gt;This month, there has been a wave of video game NFT announcements. Ubisoft launched its own heavily criticized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon: Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt; NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, some of which require &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1469051945490993162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1470107122239262724%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1470107122239262724autosize%3D1"&gt;hundreds of hours of gameplay&lt;/a&gt; be claimed. Peter Molyneux also revealed details about a business simulator where people can buy an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832188/peter-molyneux-22cans-gala-nft-blockchain-business-simulator-game-interview"&gt;actually called “Land.”&lt;/a&gt; The virtual plots have already pulled in more than $54 million in total, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peter-molyneux-nft-game-sells-plot-for-900k"&gt;according to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/peter-molyneux-raises-54m-on-promise-of-play-to-earn-nft-game-legacy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods. In fact, we’ve actually been seeing some deals that are even better than they were during the recent shopping holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UJyTOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Right now, Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods are selling for their lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has discounted the earbuds to $89.99 (with delayed shipping), which is less than what we saw them go for on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In fact, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently selling for less than they were last month. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the $179 earbuds for $139.99, yet, just like their predecessor, with delayed shipping. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeBestAirPodsdeals1222021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is also discounting the third-gen model, but only by $10 or so. You will, however, be able to get the earbuds in time for the holidays, if you intend to use them as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $169 in-store at Staples until December 18th. If you miss out on that deal, they’re also going for $179 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and $179.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still roughly a $70 discount off the cost you’d pay through Apple directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently selling for around $479 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610235-REG%2Fapple_mgyn3am_a_airpods_max_green.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $70.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton rival Echelon’s new connected bike is fit for the club</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Echelon’s EX-8S against a dark background and blue LED flywheels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YuPO_T-aOJ3qgY7DMKW5UwYR4s=/0x197:3676x2648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283671/Echelon_ex_8s_product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, the EX-8S&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Echelon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWVBtB"&gt;While Peloton is the most familiar name in connected fitness, Echelon’s bikes are probably the ones you’ve seen before without noticing. Echelon’s bikes are among the first that pop up when you google “cheaper Peloton alternative,” and it’s also the company behind Walmart’s $497 connected bike. (You might also remember them from last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452145/amazon-prime-bike-500-disavow-echelon-fitness-peleton-competitor"&gt;Amazon Prime Bike debacle&lt;/a&gt;.) Well, now one of Peloton’s biggest rivals is back with a new premium bike — the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fechelonfit.com%2Fpages%2Fechelon-ex-8s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22840197%2Fechelon-ex-8s-bike-peloton-curved-touchscreen-led" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EX-8S&lt;/a&gt;, and it is extremely extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5G2UBL"&gt;For starters, the bike sports a 24-inch 1080p curved touchscreen. Echelon says that’s to create a more immersive experience and that the screen itself also flips open 180-degrees for off-bike workouts. It’s also got not one but two light-up flywheels that can be customized by color and lighting pattern thanks to 15 LED lights — just in case you want to recreate that whole “I’m biking in a club” feeling from SoulCycle and other boutique cycling studios. During a briefing, an Echelon spokesperson confirmed you can see the lighting while you’re on the bike itself and that it’s also possible to sync them to your workout metrics. The company also claims that the two-flywheel design gives the bike better stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1p9VLW"&gt;If it looks like a light-up Peloton, that’s not a coincidence. Echelon says the bike was designed by Eric Villency, who designed the original Peloton bike and the SoulCycle bike. The bike also features 32 levels of motorized magnetic resistance. While most bikes rely on a resistance knob to tweak difficulty levels, the EX-8S also has a patent-pending digital resistance controller built into the handlebar. According to Echelon, this is so riders can easily adjust resistance while in third position (pedaling while standing). The bike itself weighs 125lbs and can support riders up to 300lbs. As for connectivity, the EX-8S also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It’s also compatible with SPD pedals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_xymY9ndJMnMsFg13ztqLtws9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102366/Echelon_ex_8s_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Echelon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Peloton’s Bike Plus, the EX-8S’s screen rotates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CpKtHY"&gt;That said, connected fitness also heavily leans on its content, and Echelon’s content library hasn’t always been as polished as its competitors. On that front, Echelon says it’s adding new fitness programs and challenges in 2022, along with “more immersive multimedia experiences” like music videos, performances, and artist spotlights. That apparently includes former NFL athletes joining rides, spotlights from artists like Lady Gaga and Norah Jones, as well as Broadway shows like &lt;em&gt;Phantom of the Opera &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXhiG2"&gt;Is the bike itself a tad ridiculous? Yes. It’s unclear who exactly sits in the Venn diagram of LED bike lovers and &lt;em&gt;Dear Evan Hansen&lt;/em&gt;. However, Peloton’s had a rocky quarter, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;competition in connected fitness is amping up&lt;/a&gt;. Echelon releasing a premium bike just ahead of CES 2022 also hints the company might be hoping to make a big splash at the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo1Psa"&gt;The EX-8S isn’t &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fechelonfit.com%2Fpages%2Fechelon-ex-8s&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F16%2F22840197%2Fechelon-ex-8s-bike-peloton-curved-touchscreen-led" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available just yet&lt;/a&gt; but will retail at $2,399 along with a $34.99 monthly subscription to Echelon’s digital content. That’s a good deal more expensive than Echelon’s other bikes, especially its $497 &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FEchelon-Connect-Sport-Indoor-Cycling-Exercise-Bike-with-90-Day-Free-Premier-Membership-105-Value%2F533034706&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart-exclusive bike&lt;/a&gt; — though that only has a tablet holder. Echelon’s other connected bikes cost between $899.99 and $1,599.99. The company says pre-sales through January 15 will get a discounted price of $1,999.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxQ5az"&gt;There used to be a joke that every game was turning into a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style battle royale, and here to make that bit a reality is &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale,&lt;/em&gt; a new Scrabble-style competitive online multiplayer game from designer Frank Lantz’s Everybody House Games (best known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/10/11/16457742/ai-paperclips-thought-experiment-game-frank-lantz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universal Paperclips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203463/hey-robot-smart-speaker-alexa-siri-google-assistant-web-free-quarantine"&gt;Hey Robot&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtZHVU"&gt;Despite the fact that it feels like a joke meant to clown on Fortnite, PUGB, and other last-person-standing games in the genre, &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale &lt;/em&gt;is very much a real game, currently available on Steam in early access for both PC and Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1dJpyJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Babble Royale is now live in early access! I think it's the funnest game I've ever worked on. Come see for yourself.&lt;a href="https://t.co/5vxJDAlYXD"&gt;https://t.co/5vxJDAlYXD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/N6WGBpB8AM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N6WGBpB8AM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Frank Lantz (@flantz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flantz/status/1471192145453215745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="emrTSK"&gt;Players parachute their beginning tile down into a grid (yes, actually), claiming a spot for themselves to start building words (as you would in Scrabble or Bananagrams) to expand outwards and eliminate other players. As you explore the map, you can spell your way onto tiles to pick up powerups or purchase additional upgrades using money gained by spelling bigger words. As time goes on, a “hot zone” will slowly creep in from the corner of the map, damaging or eliminating players from contention until only one speller reigns supreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdHXa0"&gt;And of course, there are optional cosmetics available to purchase to customize your character (i.e., the letter you parachute in with) with different patterns or hats. Yes, seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54GFvBDRrn4AtjvPwExAJlBGRww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23102448/ss_79f91b9d34922f7511aa1c7c0987ab9d1014a003.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the world we live in now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sHO4nX"&gt;I tried playing a few rounds of &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt;, but while the concept is fun as a high-brow joke on the genre, I bounced off pretty hard on the actual gameplay. You can only play new letters off the last word that you spelled, which means that longtime Scrabble players will have to seriously think about how they play. There were also times where I just was plain stuck, walled in by existing words but unable to play any real ones of my own, leaving me to sit around until the game cleared out some of the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYqH54"&gt;But for those who like competitive word games and don’t mind taking the time to adjust to &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale’s&lt;/em&gt; new strategies and idiosyncrasies, the new title is certainly one of the cleverest spins on the concept so far. The initial launch of &lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt; is also still in “Season Zero” as an early access launch, with more features and content planned for the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cln7VP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1759440/Babble_Royale/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Babble Royale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is available to download for free now on Steam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for kids</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts that will cultivate curiosity, creativity, and so much more &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="j0Yebj"&gt;Kids can be tricky giftees. They want toys, of course, but the sheer abundance of available options can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know where to start. And while you could make life easier by asking your kids what they want, they’ll likely bombard you with a laundry list of items, some of which might not be realistic. Besides, there are other factors to consider, including your budget and whether a gift is age-appropriate or safe for your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rG96i"&gt;With little time left before the holidays and shipping deadlines hanging overhead, we’ve decided to do the hard work for you. Below, we’ve compiled a list of gifts suitable for kids of all ages, ranging from tried-and-true classics like the Lite-Brite ($13) to newer additions, such as the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids ($120), Wekapo’s Inflatable Lounger ($38), and Wing’s second-gen electric bike ($910). There are also a number of STEM toys and educational gifts for younger children, as well as a few designed to spur their creativity on paper and get them moving outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwExzX"&gt;Take a look, and see what kind of fun stuff you can gift the kids in your life this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 console bundles in-store on December 17th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNavx3OJfdavVFpChqU7EzA-Ad0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70282982/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;GameStop has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a special in-store sales event&lt;/a&gt; for the hard-to-get Sony PlayStation 5 console, taking place on December 17th. The restock event requires &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergegamestopinstoreps5&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt; — which normally runs $14.99 per year but is currently discounted to $9.99 once added to your cart. GameStop &lt;a href="https://gamestop.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/12-17_PS5Event_StoreList"&gt;lists all its participating retail locations&lt;/a&gt; on its site, which spans over 700 stores across the US. While this event is being hosted at many locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkZMTo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/exclusive-ps5-restock-at-gamestop"&gt;According to Matt Swider’s &lt;em&gt;The Shortcut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop will have around 60 disc-based PS5 bundles at participating stores. The bundles will supposedly consist of a PS5 console, &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, a third-party DualSense charging station, and an additional Sony DualSense controller. Some stores may also include a $50 GameStop gift card. Additionally, Swider claims a similar in-store event for the Xbox Series X is expected next week on Thursday, December 23rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36Dqxf"&gt;Despite launching over one year ago, Sony’s PlayStation 5 is still very difficult to buy. If you have been struggling to luck out on recent online console restocks from GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, or other vendors, this may be one of the few remaining chances to score a PS5 in time for the Christmas holiday. GameStop sells its new consoles in bundle form only, so while you should not be paying more than MSRP, you can expect to potentially pay upwards of $700 or $800 depending on what accessories are being bundled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVbhtx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5:02PM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about expected quantities, bundle contents, and an upcoming Xbox Series X restock, as detailed in &lt;/em&gt;The Shortcut&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta alerts 50,000 users to targeting by ‘surveillance-for-hire’ companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4mG9WX89EGCFALMf6_zLv2iw220=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283496/acastro_211101_1777_meta_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWV9vd"&gt;Facebook’s parent company Meta has alerted 50,000 users of Facebook and Instagram that their accounts were spied on by commercial “surveillance-for-hire” schemes around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEjhSd"&gt;The users were targeted by seven entities and located in more than 100 countries, according to an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/taking-action-against-surveillance-for-hire/"&gt;update posted on Meta’s news page&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1ug8q"&gt;Targets included journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes, families of opposition, and human rights activists, the post said. The surveillance was uncovered in a monthslong investigation in which Meta identified spying groups and removed them from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psQWhT"&gt;“These companies are part of a sprawling industry that provides intrusive software tools and surveillance services indiscriminately to any customer — regardless of who they target or the human rights abuses they might enable,” wrote Meta’s director of threat disruption, David Agranovich, and head of cyber espionage investigations, Mike Dvilyanski. “This industry ‘democratizes’ these threats, making them available to government and non-government groups that otherwise wouldn’t have these capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6mdpR"&gt;A more detailed &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Threat-Report-on-the-Surveillance-for-Hire-Industry.pdf"&gt;threat report&lt;/a&gt; released by Meta named six out of the seven companies, and listed one of the entities as unknown. Four of the seven — Cobwebs Technologies, Cognyte, Black Cube, and Bluehawk CI — are based in Israel, with the other three in China, India, and North Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0NZD"&gt;In a statement provided to NPR, Black Cube &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/16/1064628654/facebook-bans-surveillance-firms-that-spied-on-50000-people"&gt;described itself as a “litigation support firm”&lt;/a&gt; that used investigation methods compliant with local laws in every jurisdiction in which it operated. Black Cube was previously employed by Harvey Weinstein to try to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/harvey-weinstein-black-cube-new-york-times"&gt;block publication of a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that sparked the #MeToo movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKDhXi"&gt;“The disclosure by Facebook of actions it has taken to disrupt and remove seven private firms selling surveillance services to regimes that abuse human rights, makes it abundantly clear that more must be done to stop this mercenary marketplace,” said Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) in a statement. “By enabling indiscriminate surveillance against journalists and political dissidents, among others, these companies pose a clear threat to human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pdhsap"&gt;Meta’s report also referenced the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which last month was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798917/apple-nso-group-spyware-pegasus-cybersecurity-research"&gt;sued by both Apple and Meta&lt;/a&gt; for selling spyware used to compromise iPhone and WhatsApp messages. Yesterday, Google researchers &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html"&gt;published details of a “zero click” exploit&lt;/a&gt; developed by NSO Group to hack targets’ phones just by sending a message — a level of offensive capability described by the researchers as comparable to that possessed by nation state actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgeJvD"&gt;The company has already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;blacklisted by the US government&lt;/a&gt; for selling software used to spy on journalists around the world. A group of lawmakers including Adam Schiff recently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-lawmakers-call-sanctions-against-israels-nso-other-spyware-firms-2021-12-15/"&gt;called for the imposition of stricter sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on a group of surveillance companies, including NSO Group, that would freeze company bank accounts and bar employees from traveling to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM announces Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is stepping down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GM’s Cruise Reveals First Vehicle Made To Run Without Driver" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O_3fYM2AXHLvpbL6EwxrWpHNgYI=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283484/1195279039.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T4teru"&gt;Dan Ammann, the CEO of Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, is stepping down, &lt;a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/leadership-changes-cruise"&gt;the automaker announced late Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Kyle Vogt, the co-founder of Cruise and its chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TH4phn"&gt;Ammann is the latest CEO of an AV company to step aside as the industry struggles to meet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;its own over-inflated expectations&lt;/a&gt; about the future of driverless cars. Earlier this year, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x7RK2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM didn’t provide a reason for Ammann’s departure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGdknG"&gt;GM didn’t provide a reason for Ammann’s departure except to say he was leaving to “pursue other opportunities.” A spokesperson for Cruise declined to provide any additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckW2Np"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/11/11195808/gm-cruise-automation-self-driving-acquisition"&gt;GM acquired Cruise in 2016&lt;/a&gt; to speed up its self-driving car development program. Ammann, who was then the president of GM, oversaw the acquisition and later assumed the role of CEO of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVvUbo"&gt;In 2020, he presided over the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;the Origin&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first purpose-built autonomous vehicle. Under his leadership, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331794/cruise-acquires-voyage-self-driving-car-merger"&gt;acquired rival AV startup Voyage&lt;/a&gt; and raised enough investment to bring its valuation up to $19 billion. And earlier this year, he outlined a plan to scale up Cruise’s fleet to 1 million vehicles by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma0ODq"&gt;But Ammann also oversaw some setbacks, most noticeably the decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;delay a planned launch of a robotaxi service&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco in 2019. The company has yet to commit to a new date but has implied it will be in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o87ylB"&gt;“GM is deeply committed to its vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion, and AV technology will play a critical role in realizing it,” GM said in a statement. “Under GM’s ownership to date, Cruise has seized the leadership position in commercial autonomous ridesharing and has created significant value for both GM shareholders and Cruise’s minority shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This Echo Show on the wall is the fairest of them all, but it’s not that smart  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fkjUWo"&gt;The original idea for Amazon’s Echo Show was a large, screen-based device that would offer up relevant, glanceable information for the modern family, replacing outdated devices like bulletin boards, paper calendars, and sticky notes on the fridge. In 2017, Amazon couldn’t quite achieve that vision for a price that a modern family would be willing to pay. So, instead, it released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15865292/amazon-echo-show-alexa-review"&gt;small, squat seven-inch touchscreen smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; that, frankly, did little more than Amazon’s screen-less Echos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08tjb1"&gt;But it was a start. And as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;Echo Show has evolved over the ensuing four years&lt;/a&gt;, the company finally has a device that it thinks fits that original vision: the Echo Show 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CaGBMJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10927033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnGwZr"&gt;The $249.99 Echo Show 15 is billed as a shared hub for families to see things like upcoming calendar appointments, to-dos, digital sticky note reminders, and shopping lists. It’s also an excellent kitchen TV (not a high bar, to be fair). Of course, it does everything other Echo displays and speakers do, thanks to the presence of Amazon’s smart voice assistant, Alexa. This includes playing music, showing weather reports, streaming video, controlling smart home gadgets, telling fart jokes, all the stuff you’ve come to rely on Alexa for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiQzbX"&gt;A very solid piece of hardware, the Echo Show 15 is a stunning device. It looks impressive on your wall when called into action, and otherwise blends into the background as a digital photo frame displaying art or family photos. It fills a niche that no device has reliably conquered to date: a wall-mounted tablet to replace the plethora of analog paper tools busy households traditionally rely on to communicate with each other. You can use it on your countertop with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an optional stand&lt;/a&gt; if you can find the room — at 15.8 x 9.9 x 1.4 inches, this thing is huge — but the wall is the better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPagWr"&gt;The concept is good. But the execution is underwhelming. As is a theme with Amazon devices, on day one there is plenty of room for improvement on the software front. There’s a lot crammed onto this admittedly large screen, but ultimately while the Echo Show 15 tries to be something for everyone, it ends up struggling to be particularly useful for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MF2A_rhwtifc1hZKLtpphgu2sno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086571/dseifert_211208_4924_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 can be mounted on the wall or on a counter (with an additional stand) in either portrait or landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nh8WoI"&gt;In terms of specs, the Echo Show 15 is a 15.6-inch screen with a 1080p touch display, with the processing power of the new Amazon AZ2 neural edge processor behind it — the first Show to use Amazon’s latest chip. It has a new homescreen layout that divides its time between the standard rotating Echo Show content (which you can customize) and a new feature: widgets. You can also have it just display art or photos (stored in Amazon Photos or Facebook, nowhere else, sadly), fulfilling its picture frame ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9qkkL"&gt;Aesthetically, the Echo Show has a black frame with a white mat, resembling a standard picture frame. Tech-wise it looks like the Samsung Frame TV and the Facebook Portal had a baby. It comes in one color, and you can’t change the familiar Alexa blue background behind the widgets — I’d like to see some customization options all around. Two 1.6 speakers on either side (or top and bottom in portrait) provide decent if slightly tinny sound, and a small row of buttons on the top or side (depending on orientation) offer volume up / down, mute, and camera shutter controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IemQc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Show 15, like Goldilocks’ proverbial porridge, is just the right size. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVSlRy"&gt;The widget concept is a nice addition, and the potential is huge — especially as Amazon has released an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586033/amazon-alexa-widgets-featured-skill-api-developers-echo-show-screen"&gt;API that developers can use&lt;/a&gt; to add widgets to their Alexa Skills. Currently, however, you’re stuck with a dozen or so Amazon widgets that are limited in their usefulness. They include calendar and reminders (you can import calendars from Google, Apple, and Microsoft), shopping list, sticky notes, smart home controls, a to-do list (Alexa only), weather, your commute, photos, maps, music and audio, reorder suggestions, Alexa suggestions, and your Amazon deliveries. A new What to Eat option offers up recipes and nearby delivery suggestions from partners such as Domino’s and Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQXLDZ"&gt;In our app-driven world, you likely already have favorite tools that do most of these things, and frustratingly, you can’t port any of them to the Show. It’s all Amazon, for now. There’s also limited customization, and while you can rearrange and resize some widgets, if you have any enabled they take up almost half the screen. While the Show 15 is noticeably snappier than others in the family, it’s not super responsive and takes two or three seconds to respond to taps and swipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixMTZl"&gt;Interestingly, the widgets take the Show from being a voice-first device (which is something I’ve always struggled with) to one with a lot more touch functionality. It’s the most tactile Show to date, and the widgets invite you to come on in and stay awhile as you check your calendar, browse shows to watch on the expanded Video Home screen, and attempt to control your smart home from the (limited) Smart Home widget (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 is best suited for wall mounting and can be set to just display photos until someone approaches it when it switches to the widget format.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wnwvA0"&gt;While the Show 15 is designed as a hub for family organization, it is not a communication device. My biggest disappointment here is its 5-megapixel camera that produced pixelated, blown-out images during my Alexa calling and Drop-In testing. (Zoom is not yet supported, but Amazon says it will be coming next year.) Despite the souped-up processor, video constantly freezes and lags, making it unusable for an actual conversation. It also doesn’t have the auto-framing of its Echo Show 8 and Show 10 counterparts, both of which have a more robust 13-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYEELh"&gt;It seems Amazon was looking for a differentiator from the Show 10, which Amazon tells me is its “communication device.” The rotating 10 can follow you around a room while you talk, keeping you in the frame as you chop veggies or unload the dishwasher. But who really is going to have a Show 10 and a Show 15 in their kitchen? Two $250 devices in one room seems like legitimate overkill. If they had bumped up the camera in the 15 to make video calling better, this would be a much more useful device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tMWfWH5Of2w9mWGgnCUTYm4_mcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086566/jtuohy_211209_4924_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slimline design allows room for speakers without a super bulky form factor when mounted on the wall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JdP4cW"&gt;The best feature of the Show 15 is its size. To date, screens for the kitchen have either been too large (see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18170285/ge-google-netflix-spotify-exhaust-vent-smart-display-kitchen-hub-ces-2019"&gt;GE Appliances’ monstrous screen&lt;/a&gt; built into an over-the-range hood) or too inflexible (Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/4/11591780/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-hands-on-price-release-date"&gt;Family Hub fridge&lt;/a&gt; with a portrait tablet built in). The Show 15, like Goldilocks’ proverbial porridge, is just the right size. The 15.6-inch screen’s housing is just shy of 10 inches tall and 16 inches wide and is designed to fit under standard kitchen cabinets or between two doorways in an open plan house, Chris Green, VP of industrial design at Amazon Lab126, tells me. It’s also very flexible. You can mount it on the wall in either a portrait or landscape orientation, and thanks to the included, cleverly designed mount, it’s easy to swap it from one to the other when your use case changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9xrNQ"&gt;A compelling reason to buy this is for a good-quality, compact screen for watching TV while in the kitchen. It’s the first Echo Show to support full HD resolution streaming from Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, but it’s missing key players such as Disney Plus and HBO Max. Sling TV support is coming soon, which will bring another option for watching live TV (Hulu Live being the other).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUy1Pd"&gt;One downside, however, is the 16:9 ratio of the screen means you get two black bars when watching widescreen movies. The white picture frame design also doesn’t lend itself to immersive viewing — but for a kitchen TV, it’s a nice device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A52ML6"&gt;A new feature that makes this more useful is picture-in-picture. This allows you to view a security camera feed or video doorbell while also looking at other content. So, you can have a baby monitor running while you’re following a recipe. The Show can stream video from any Alexa-compatible camera and if you have a Ring video doorbell, it will pop up a live feed on the screen when someone rings the bell and you can talk to them through the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume, mute, and camera cover buttons are on the top or side of the device, depending on how it’s mounted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogzfXFtrv833Pn71YwgIFCnkxKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086556/jtuohy_211207_4924_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mounting system works with a wall mount or stand (pictured) as well as other mounting accessories made by Sanus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frPXIA"&gt;In my testing, I initially assumed I’d want it in the landscape orientation — and for TV viewing, that was the best option. But for the family hub features — shopping lists, calendars, and even widget use — it was more helpful in portrait as you see more information on the screen. This was especially true for smart home control. And while you can’t pin a full-screen widget (it always reverts to the home screen), the full-sized portrait smart home widget shows 12 separate tiles for your devices, compared to just six or seven in the landscape. Frustratingly, you only get individual devices to control in the widget (no groups) but in the full-screen mode, you do get the option to use groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qSOoK"&gt;Setting up the Show is an easy process; once powered on, you walk through a series of screens to connect to Wi-Fi and accept Amazon’s litany of terms and agreements. New here is the option to add Visual ID (Voice ID and enabling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448926/amazon-sidewalk-ring-echo-tile-wifi-mesh-ble-location-tracking"&gt;Amazon Sidewalk&lt;/a&gt; may also be new to you if you haven’t set up a Show in a while). These are all optional, but the Visual ID — a new feature that leverages that AZ2 processor — uses the camera to serve up relevant content such as calendar appointments, commute times, and notes from family members, depending on who is standing in front of it. It can even be used to gate content to kid-safe things if you set it up to recognize a child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tl9Ffc"&gt;This is great in theory, but in my testing, it repeatedly failed to identify who was there and sometimes couldn’t see anyone at all. The Show can also recognize your voice, but that regularly failed in my testing, too. Amazon says the processing for the Visual ID happens locally, and the identifying information is stored on the Echo Show 15 itself, not in the cloud. The facial profiles aren’t shared across devices, so you need to set it up with each Echo Show 15. This feature is also coming to Show 8 and Show 10, according to Amazon’s press materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuKQkd"&gt;I ran into several issues setting up Visual ID and Voice ID for my family members, specifically my children. If you have Amazon Kids profiles set up already, you just tap on those in your account settings and walk through the process. I had no problems setting up my daughter’s Voice and Visual ID, but when it came to my 13-year-old son, the Show kept thinking he was my daughter. He was not amused. After the third time Alexa recognized him as a 10 year-old-girl, he was done with the whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="UVPGxP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10927032"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkuwd9"&gt;Visual ID was also buggy in everyday use — it seemed to like my daughter the best, often mistaking me and my husband for her. But occasionally, it just wouldn’t work at all, stubbornly refusing to see me as I stood in front of it. When it did work, the only real personalization features were recently played music. It can offer up different calendars based on who is viewing, but in the time I had to review the device, I wasn’t able to reconfigure all my family’s individual Apple and Google calendars to sync with Alexa. Instead, I ported in a shared Google calendar we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UieyI"&gt;I’d advise setting up the device first and trying it out in a couple of locations before committing to a wall mount, although that was my preference after spending a week testing it. The wall mount option is nowhere near as daunting as I’d anticipated. Amazon provides a paper template, and you’ll want to break out a level and a drill, but it’s mostly painless and not much more work than hanging a large picture or artwork on the wall. Drill holes for four screws, attach the wall mount, and you’re done. The Show slides onto the mount thanks to four grooves in the back and you can switch between portrait and landscape at will without having to re-drill anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO6Lyb"&gt;A tabletop stand sold separately &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $30&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t offer as much flexibility (you need a screwdriver to reconfigure the orientation). For &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LFLKMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40&lt;/a&gt; there’s an option that will let you change from portrait to landscape without having to break out a screwdriver. An &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LCK96Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;under-cabinet mount for $50&lt;/a&gt; lets you tilt and swivel. I tested the $30 stand, and it’s solid and well-made but very large. The footprint this thing takes up on a countertop (289 square inches in our test setting) is too big for a lot of kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYHPYI"&gt;The biggest issue with wall mounting is going to be cable management. If you’re okay with a cord going down your wall and you have a nearby outlet, you’re all set. But if you’re like me, you are going to want to route this through the wall or devise another way to hide the cable. Amazon’s Chris Green tells me that snaking the cable through the wall as you might with a TV is perfectly fine, but you know — at your own risk and endeavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WE51ru"&gt;The Show 15 comes with a five-foot cable, potentially making placement tricky (a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LK8V8G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six-foot extension cord is available for $13&lt;/a&gt;). I had nowhere in my kitchen to wall mount this, as all my walls are tiled, except for one corner of the room that would have made the perfect spot, but there’s no outlet anywhere nearby. I ended up placing it in portrait mode in a main hallway that we use to come in and out of the house. While we sacrifice the TV aspect this way, it’s actually a more useful place for some of those visual reminders, and I have the lights for the three closest rooms set up on the smart home widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UoIDdJ2917DmPN_k4Mdnvq4UOPA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23086559/jtuohy_211207_4924_0008.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 15 is the largest smart display available today, here you can see it dwarfs the 10-inch Nest Hub Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CCcONQ"&gt;Speaking of the smart home side, it’s a big disappointment. There’s no Zigbee radio built in for connecting devices and the three or four individual devices you can access from the smart home widget limit its usefulness for managing your connected home. You can’t pin the full-screen smart home control to the display; it will always revert to the homepage. You also can’t tap the widget to get to it, you have to swipe down and tap the Smart Home button from the menu. I couldn’t even get a voice command to bring it up. It was not designed with the smart home front of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TInvot"&gt;However, if that’s not your primary use case, this can be a handy tool for household organization. That is once some software updates roll out to fix those Visual ID bugs and a few non-Alexa widgets start appearing. As of today, it’s only helpful if you are all-in on Amazon for organization of your shopping, reminders, and to-do lists. If you’ve been wanting a wall-mounted smart display, this is really your only ready-to-use option and will be a great addition to your kitchen if you’re happy with the limited ecosystem. But if you like using other services, I’d advise waiting to see what widgets third-party developers come up with before picking one up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOZJaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 4:55PM ET, December 16th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated that it wasn’t possible to use the Echo Show 15’s camera as a motion sensor for Alexa Routines. That is incorrect, you are able to trigger routines using the camera as a motion sensor. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French regulator tells Clearview AI to delete its facial recognition data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7XzDRkhNuEGpavF93LZLPqN11U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70283387/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y92EHK"&gt;France’s foremost privacy regulator has ordered Clearview AI to delete all its data relating to French citizens, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/clearview-gdpr-breaches-france/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9okCes"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reconnaissance-faciale-la-cnil-met-en-demeure-clearview-ai-de-cesser-la-reutilisation-de"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the French agency CNIL argued that Clearview had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;violated the GDPR&lt;/a&gt; in collecting the data and violated various other data access rights in its processing and storage. As a result, CNIL is calling on Clearview to purge the data from its systems or face escalating fines as laid out by European privacy law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17t1MP"&gt;Clearview rose to prominence in 2020 after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the company’s massive data collection efforts. In particular, the company offered the unique ability to identify subjects by name, drawing on data scraped from public-facing social networks. Subsequent reporting showed the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-trump-investors-friend-facial-recognition"&gt;deep ties to right-wing political activism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table"&gt;widespread use within US law enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85rDny"&gt;CNIL’s motion is similar to a recently issued order in Australia, and it likely won’t be the last such order to come out of the EU. (Clearview has contested the order.) While CNIL only has jurisdiction over infringements on the rights of French citizens, other European regulators are sure to follow suit if the case is successful. Similar complaints have already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455446/clearview-ai-legal-privacy-complaint-privacy-international-facial-recognition-eu"&gt;filed by Privacy International&lt;/a&gt; in Greece, Italy, and Austria. Last year, the ACLU launched a similar case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;in US federal court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHt20q"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, CEO Hoan Ton-That insisted the company’s data was collected legally. “We only collect public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law,” Ton-That wrote. “My intentions and those of my company have always been to help communities and their people to live better, safer lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
