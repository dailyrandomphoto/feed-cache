    <title>Bungie addresses major Destiny 2 player complaints with massive changes on the horizon</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eH-NEu8RMLlYFIGUSvABBVKrCsU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876272/media_wallaper_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Y5G0i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, Bungie’s long-running online sci-fi shooter, has a year of substantial changes ahead of it, according to a new roadmap the studio &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50124"&gt;detailed in an extensive blog post published on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. While the game’s next major expansion, &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, has been delayed to early 2022, Bungie says it has major overhauls planned for nearly every aspect of the game — from the competitive multiplayer Crucible mode to how players progress and become more powerful across the game’s seasonal expansion model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miQTtB"&gt;One of the biggest changes slated for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is a major crossplay implementation that will, for the first time, allow players on PC and players on consoles to join one another for activities. In its blog post, Bungie said crossplay is coming later this year in season 15, and most importantly, the studio confirms it will not mandate crossplay for competitive activities as many fans feared. “Don’t worry, we won’t be matching console and PC players together in the Crucible unless PC players specifically invite their console friends to play with them in the PC Crucible pools,” the blog post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXUmbX"&gt;There are a ton of other major changes planned, many of which address long-standing player complaints. Here’s a rundown of some of the more significant ones: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCDa4q"&gt;Bungie will no longer “sunset” weapons and armor by making older items obsolete. The studio says “any weapon or armor that can currently be infused to max power will continue to be able to reach max power permanently.” That’s a huge relief for players who’ve been frustrated at the sunsetting experiment over the last year leaving behind fan-favorite gear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCExZc"&gt;The Vault of Glass, &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;’s very first raid, is coming back as part of the &lt;em&gt;Destiny Content Vault&lt;/em&gt; in season 14 this summer. Bungie now says it will eventually launch a “master” difficult version to align the raid with the game’s hardest player versus environment (PvE) activities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Js0dns"&gt;Bungie is planning an “overhaul” of the ultra-competitive Trials of Osiris game mode to improve matchmaking, rebuild the incentivize structure to encourage less skilled players to compete, and to figure out ways to allow solo players to participate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XHBcTO"&gt;Bungie has outlined major changes to how its Darkness-based Stasis subclass functions in both PvE and PvP activities to tone down its dominance against human opponents and bring the older subclasses up to par. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HP34vT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;will no longer force players to grind out 50 power level points every season and will instead introduce minor season expansions with just a 10 power level jump. That should make it easier for players to sink back into the game at the start of new seasons and not feel pressured to level up. (This is my personal favorite announcement of the day.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s5RUgj"&gt;Many of these changes represent Bungie’s renewed effort to listen to its diehard fans, many of whom have been playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;and its predecessor since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrkxmc"&gt;Common complaints include exhausting grinds to reach max power level and enjoy the game’s most rewarding activities, a lack of attention and focus on the competitive Crucible game mode, and inconsistencies in the depth and richness of certain expansions versus others that can result in long content draughts and little incentive to keep playing. Bungie appears to be tackling all of this with its 2021 plans, all leading up to the eventual release of &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GUTG7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Destiny universe looks more promising than ever &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRpOCi"&gt;The studio has weathered countless storms before, including a near-constant ebb and flow between extreme player satisfaction and frenzied outrage. With last year’s &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light,&lt;/em&gt; Bungie signaled it was ready to push the &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;universe toward a longer-term scope with a more service-oriented model and a more cohesive vision for the game’s story and structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq80Lj"&gt;Effectively, this meant no &lt;em&gt;Destiny 3&lt;/em&gt;; the series would move forward in its current state and evolve over time, like a proper MMO or live service game. And last week, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50109"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a major shuffle of its executive leadership and a studio expansion that includes an expansion of the &lt;em&gt;Destiny &lt;/em&gt;universe into “additional media,” opening the door to film and TV and other formats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuwlaA"&gt;Bungie has proven that it’s more than capable of listening to feedback and focusing its attention and resources where they matter most, and this most recent roadmap is making &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; look more promising than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook now wants to make ‘Hey Facebook’ a thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-vgok5emL8SSqOENL5lQc_ITvU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876191/dseifert_191009_3728_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SJQry"&gt;Facebook has introduced a new “Hey Facebook” wake word for its family of Portal smart displays and the Oculus Quest platform. The company only &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fsay-hey-facebook-to-stay-hands-free-with-oculus-quest-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301697%2Foculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;formally announced it&lt;/a&gt; was gradually rolling out to Quest headsets, but its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F743419682779926%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301697%2Foculus-portal-smart-display-hey-facebook-wake-word-quest-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Portal support page now lists&lt;/a&gt; “Hey Facebook” as an alternative to “Hey Portal.” A look through the Wayback Machine shows it used to only list “Hey Portal” as &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210205040527/https://portal.facebook.com/help/2149102838698668/"&gt;recently as February 5th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARaIyB"&gt;Oculus owners can fret a little less knowing that it’s launching as an opt-in feature, buried in the Experimental Features panel within the headset’s settings. Oculus says it will remain that way, too, which was smart to mention, knowing that some users might fear it’ll become mandatory. You can also still use the Voice Commands app to issue commands by double-tapping the Oculus button without opting in to use the “Hey Facebook” wake word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uhXXLV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an opt-in feature&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RB6tFN"&gt;This seems like a natural progression for the Portal devices, but it’s more confusing for Oculus headsets, where saying “Hey Oculus” would make more sense. The intent of having it on the headset is to let you do things with your voice so that you don’t need to interrupt the VR action as much. The reasoning is sound, but it might still infuriate some users who oppose Facebook’s ever-growing presence in virtual reality. This just marks the next step.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ealwFI"&gt;We haven’t been able to verify if “Hey Facebook” works with Portal devices yet. But this feature is gradually rolling out to Quest 2 users first starting today and later to all Quest headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Live is down with users unable to sign in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujv09mufEcPrCzsu9-Jnu7YfLQQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68876185/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5usoKn"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Live service is down, preventing users from signing in to the service. The Xbox Live problems started at around 3:15PM ET today, and Microsoft has confirmed it’s investigating the outage. “We are aware that users may not be able to sign-in to Xbox Live at this time,” says Xbox support. “Our teams are currently investigating to fix this issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iuq74B"&gt;If you’re not already signed in to your Xbox, the sign-in process will fail with an error, preventing access to certain services like Xbox Party chat. Some apps may also fail to launch without the core Xbox Live services being online, and a number of games will also not launch correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIuAGN"&gt;Microsoft has marked the Xbox Live issues as a “major outage” over at the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status"&gt;Xbox status page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L9qd0r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are aware that users may not be able to sign-in to Xbox Live at this time. Our teams are currently investigating to fix this issue. We will update here and on &lt;a href="https://t.co/PzAdjUFMJj"&gt;https://t.co/PzAdjUFMJj&lt;/a&gt; when we have more information to share!&lt;/p&gt;— Xbox Support (@XboxSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1365043994552455168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7SUcrK"&gt;This is the first big Xbox Live outage since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559320/xbox-live-login-problems-xbox-series-s-series-x"&gt;issues occurred&lt;/a&gt; during the Xbox Series X and Series S launch in November last year. Xbox Live also went down a few times throughout 2020, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic when the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188972/microsoft-xbox-live-outage-down-second-time-multiplayer-service-disruption"&gt;faced issues twice in a week&lt;/a&gt; as millions started social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fisker quietly settled trade secret spat with VW-backed battery company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VlTpGBVQUHyh6emXwFXVyMzI9qM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875933/jbareham_180108_2235_0095.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYGNKQ"&gt;Fisker Inc. quietly settled a previously unreported trade secret lawsuit with Volkswagen-backed solid-state battery company QuantumScape last July, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The suit, filed in April 2019 in Santa Clara Superior Court, was centered on a former QuantumScape employee who brought thousands of confidential documents with her to a new job at Fisker Inc. in late 2018 and early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61jx8k"&gt;While the lawsuit played out, Fisker Inc. locked away those documents and the work done by the employee, and even “quarantined” battery cells made while she worked there, though it ultimately argued the information was public domain. As part of the settlement, Fisker Inc. ultimately agreed to delete or destroy the documents the employee brought with her. Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000119312520313931/d92481d424b3.htm"&gt;recently disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; that it agreed to pay $750,000 in cash to settle claims of trade secret misappropriation in July 2020, though it did not name QuantumScape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vqhdJe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fisker paid $750,000 as part of the settlement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9hH7cB"&gt;The suit was settled at the same time that Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322573/fisker-vw-meb-modular-platform-architecture-ocean-suv-apollo"&gt;was trying to strike a deal with Volkswagen to power its first SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the Ocean, with the German automaker’s new modular electric vehicle platform. Those talks have fallen apart, though, as the two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;blew past their deadline to strike a deal&lt;/a&gt;. Fisker Inc. has since contracted automotive supplier Magna to build the Ocean SUV and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;an agreement with iPhone-maker Foxconn&lt;/a&gt; to build a second vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3C7ru"&gt;Volkswagen made a $100 million investment in QuantumScape in 2018 and &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-increases-stake-in-quantumscape-6136"&gt;added another $200 million to the joint venture last June&lt;/a&gt;. But the German automaker has been collaborating with the battery company since 2012. A Stanford spinout, QuantumScape is one of many companies working on solid-state batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte found in lithium-ion batteries with a solid material that could help increase energy density, allow faster charging, and reduce the risk of fire. Like Fisker Inc, QuantumScape merged with a special purpose acquisition company last year and is now publicly traded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDGSLg"&gt;In 2019, Fisker Inc. delayed a luxury sports car that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18270350/henrik-fisker-electric-suv-karma-emotion-delayed"&gt;was supposed to use the solid-state battery it was developing&lt;/a&gt; because the tech wasn’t ready. QuantumScape argued in the lawsuit that the employee, battery researcher Anna Choi, and Fisker Inc. tried to use the information to “redirect Fisker’s development of the thin film ceramic electrolyte for its lithium-based battery to emulate QuantumScape’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PmsdAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric cars could use another big battery breakthrough — this CEO says he’s got it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTDzmY"&gt;QuantumScape described in the suit how Choi brought confidential material to Fisker Inc. before and after taking a job with the EV startup, and she admitted to doing so as part of the settlement. QuantumScape also tried to argue Choi was directed by Fisker Inc. executives to bring over the confidential material, including co-founder Geeta Gupta Fisker and then-head of battery development Fabio Albano. Gupta Fisker and Albano separately denied this, and Fisker Inc. claimed Choi acted of her own volition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjPtfU"&gt;Choi and QuantumScape did not respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Albano and a spokesperson for Volkswagen declined to comment. Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker declined to comment on the lawsuit in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TQe43I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Choi gave Fisker a 52-slide PowerPoint “playbook” of QuantumScape’s innovations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5C7L8"&gt;According to the lawsuit, the trouble started when Choi gave Fisker Inc. a 52-slide PowerPoint — described in the heavily redacted lawsuit as a “virtual playbook” to key QuantumScape innovations and trade secrets, with “detailed recipes, processes, [and] ingredients” — in an interview with the EV startup on November 20th, 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEsQ4t"&gt;“Immediately after her interview, [Fisker Inc.] began peppering Choi with requests for her ‘recommendations’ regarding equipment to be used, vendors, and pricing,” lawyers for QuantumScape wrote in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QV4xxM"&gt;QuantumScape further claimed Choi “emailed highly confidential QuantumScape materials to her personal Yahoo email account” on December 11th and 12th in 2018. On December 14th, again met with Fisker Inc. at the EV startup’s Torrance, California headquarters to attend its holiday party, according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bbQyF"&gt;That same day, QuantumScape said Choi logged in to the company’s secure intranet system from an IP address “publicly associated with Fisker” and “reviewed and downloaded several dozen highly confidential technical documents to which she had been granted restricted access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WhiuNY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fisker said it had no use for the information, and argued it was public anyway&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="An619d"&gt;Fisker Inc.’s legal team pushed back on this, arguing that QuantumScape was broadly using the term “trade secrets” to refer to public information about its battery tech, and “because QuantumScape utterly failed to reasonably protect the secrecy of its ‘trade secrets’ by allowing Choi ‘unfettered and unmonitored access to its networks,’ according to a filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8d8bp"&gt;“It was only by chance (because Choi referenced a QuantumScape item number on a call with a third-party supplier) did QuantumScape learn of Choi’s activity,” lawyers for Fisker Inc. wrote. “[D]espite Choi’s unilateral actions, Fisker never wanted any QuantumScape confidential information, and it has not used any QuantumScape non-public information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tavrv"&gt;Fisker Inc. fired Choi in April 2019 just a few weeks after the lawsuit was filed. Albano, a highly touted battery expert, left Fisker Inc. in May 2019, though Fisker Inc. contends he was fired in court filings. Albano has since filed a previously unreported breach of contract suit against Fisker Inc. in Los Angeles County Superior Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KxYnS"&gt;Since settling the trade secret lawsuit, both Fisker Inc. and QuantumScape have gone public and raised eye-popping amounts of money. Fisker Inc. went public in October 2020 &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/02/electric-vehicle-stocks-come-unplugged/"&gt;and raised $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s now planning to use more conventional lithium-ion batteries in its vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TvJDGW"&gt;QuantumScape went public in November 2020 and raised around $700 million in the process. In December, it published test results that showed its battery clearing key hurdles. QuantumScape’s CEO claimed to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; that he thinks it is “the first to solve solid-state.” Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/volkswagen-sinks-another-200-million-into-solid-state-battery-company-quantumscape/"&gt;has said it hopes to put QuantumScape’s battery into production by 2025&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A court is forcing Valve to tell Apple how much money 436 different PC games made</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bpkXCPEO1w3CLMq6sjASc7udQeE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875727/acastro_180509_1777_steam_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqMUYh"&gt;Valve has been compelled by a California court to provide sales data on more than 400 Steam games to Apple and possibly reveal its yearly sales, revenue, and profits to Apple as well. The iPhone maker subpoenaed Valve for the data as part of its ongoing dispute with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COCXIQ"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.356.0.pdf"&gt;to a Wednesday order by Judge Thomas Hixson&lt;/a&gt;, Valve will have to provide yearly sales and pricing data on 436 games that are available on both its PC game distribution platform, Steam, and the Epic Games Store. Apple has requested the data so it can define the video game market in its case against Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBOEl4"&gt;In a filing published on February 18th, Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291297/apple-valve-data-steam-sales-epic-games-dispute"&gt;had argued&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s demands were overly broad. Apple had asked for even more data in its subpoena, including annual revenues from Steam, the name of every app on Steam, and the date range for when those apps had been available. Valve argued that the demands would “impose an extraordinary burden” on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMvvZH"&gt;Valve has also been compelled to share “aggregated data” about how much it makes from Steam, though it’s not clear exactly what that will entail. Apple had asked for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ksuk20"&gt;RFP 2 asks for documents sufficient to show since 2008 Valve’s (a) total yearly sales from apps and in-app purchases from Steam, (b) annual advertising revenue attributable to Steam, (c) annual sales of external products attributable to Steam, (d) annual revenues from Steam, and (e) annual earnings, income or profits from Steam. Apple asks for this information by app if that is available. During meet and confer Apple limited the relevant time period to 2015 to the present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eMV74O"&gt;In his ruling, Judge Hixson largely sided with Apple. “In the letter brief, Valve said this would be an overwhelming amount of work, but other than using adjectives, it did not substantiate or quantify the burden in any way,” Hixson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y8vCx"&gt;“Apple has shown that it has a substantial need for this information to obtain evidence in support of its arguments concerning market definition and the effects of competition, and it cannot obtain this information elsewhere without undue burden,” he added. “Valve offers several reasons why Apple has not satisfied this standard, but none is persuasive.” Valve is the biggest PC game store in existence and generally doesn’t provide any sales data whatsoever, though you can find &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110?"&gt;simple unordered lists of the bestselling games&lt;/a&gt; each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9dLK4"&gt;Hixson did narrow the amount of information Valve has to provide. While Apple requested data dating back to 2015, Hixson ruled that Valve only needs to produce data from 2017 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTzUWa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;Epic sued Apple in August&lt;/a&gt; after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;removed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; for introducing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that it says violated App Store rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use your Oculus Quest 2 to play any PC VR game wirelessly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Sb_6aZYKAVgUN-Mu726FoGJrQ=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68643020/hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh hey, it’s all of my PC games available to play on the Quest 2, wire-free, from within a virtual room. This is getting weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vDDDh3"&gt;One of the best features of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn’t otherwise run natively on the headset. That’s great if you want a way to play games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; but the obvious downside is that you’re now physically tethered to a PC — so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTupji"&gt;Thankfully, the developers at Virtual Desktop have already figured out the seemingly impossible: how to run system-intensive titles on your PC and stream the visual feed to your VR device while syncing all of your movements over Wi-Fi. It gives you the best of both worlds: letting you play the games you want without being attached by a cable to your computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3KFeB"&gt;Doing this is now as simple as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying and installing a $20 app through the Oculus store&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t always so easy. There used to be several steps involved, but Virtual Desktop’s developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301151/oculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2"&gt;recently pushed an update&lt;/a&gt; that makes it considerably easier to stream your PC VR games via Wi-Fi. In short, the app can handle it natively instead of requiring a patch as a workaround. And with the latest update to this article, its length has been cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E0oS4h"&gt;Buy the Virtual Desktop app for Quest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qYkSF8"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app lets you access your PC through the lens of a VR headset. You can use it for games, like we’ll be doing, but you can also watch movies you have stored on your PC in a variety of different virtual environments. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22218827%2Foculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;There’s a Quest-specific version of the app that you can purchase here for $20&lt;/a&gt;. (Make sure it says that it’s compatible with Quest underneath the purchase button.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsBT4k"&gt;After you purchase it, install it on the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVvcJViGCifzUvXoqbandzJ1-6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220864/vd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop running on the Quest 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7F3xXK"&gt;Download Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zwiEFT"&gt;There’s yet one more application to download: &lt;a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/"&gt;Virtual Desktop Streamer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free, and made by the same folks who made the Virtual Desktop app you purchased on the Quest 2. This app simply streams PC content to your headset via Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LRXQqT"&gt;Once this app is downloaded and installed, you’ll need to input your Oculus username in the Streamer window &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ovpydi"&gt;If you don’t know it off the top of your head, you can find it by opening the Oculus app on mobile, navigating to “Settings,” and then tapping on the area that shows your name and email address. The name that will display next to your avatar is your username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-J0UPjJSbyMOlAcOy2iyZNZhBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220804/oculusname.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having a hard time finding your Oculus username? Tap on your full name in the Settings menu to see this view pictured above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dCc3Bu"&gt;After that’s entered, hit “Save”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RXWg5x"&gt;That’s the last step! But remember that it’s crucial to have the Virtual Desktop Streamer app open in order for your headset to communicate with your PC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop Streamer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uFCk8sazQ5CJ39c4U4ARWJVRwXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220811/streamer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what the Virtual Desktop Streamer app looks like. It’s very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FylPqj"&gt;Open Virtual Desktop on your Quest 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFxMTY"&gt;You should see your PC pop up in the list of available devices to connect to from within the Virtual Desktop app on your Quest 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWDSZP"&gt;Once you’ve connected, the Options button (the left Touch controller’s equivalent of the Oculus button) is mapped to open up the top-level menu for Virtual Desktop, as shown in the image below. From there, clicking “Games” will reveal every game that’s installed on your PC. You can simply boot each one from there, and your PC will handle all of the hard work. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Virtual Desktop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RetcNAlbbLJZGLVlASVqciHC1_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220812/virtudaldesktopgames.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the VR-ready games installed on your PC will show up within Virtual Desktop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E4ucp4"&gt;If you aren’t happy with the visual fidelity within each game, you’re free to customize some settings that affect latency, refresh rate, and more. Note that you’ll likely get a clearer, more fluid image if your PC is powerful. Your wireless router plays a huge role in delivering a smooth experience, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNzjSC"&gt;Streaming VR over Wi-Fi certainly isn’t a perfect solution. I play just a few feet away from a Wi-Fi 6-ready router that’s wired directly to my PC via an ethernet switch, yet I still experience the occasional spot of lag and slightly fuzzy image. Though with enough tweaking on the Virtual Desktop app (turning Wi-Fi off on seldom-used tech items never hurts), I think you’ll have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zU1OZb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook is turning VR into a platform — but some indie devs fear its power","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ot7NCR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original article erroneously suggested that internet speed played a role in your ability to use this wireless solution to play your VR games. It’s all handled locally. Also, due to a malfunctioning USB-C port on the author’s PC, they erroneously stated that the USB-C cable included with each Quest 2 couldn’t be used to complete this how-to. A reader pointed out that it will work, and the author confirmed it by using the cable with an OTG adapter. We regret these errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch, owned by Amazon, pulls Amazon’s anti-union ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fkl2h5YThPKwhZbXStIkKlp8S48=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875431/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="90e0WO"&gt;Twitch is removing the anti-union ads that its parent company, Amazon, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1364318690271969285?s=20"&gt;was running on the platform&lt;/a&gt;. The ads showed Amazon employees talking about why they want to vote no on unionization and directed viewers to Amazon’s “DoItWithoutDues” website. A Twitch spokesperson said the ads “should never have been allowed to run on [the] service,” as they violate its political advertising policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhGp1D"&gt;Twitch also says that it is “evaluating [its] review processes to ensure that similar content does not run in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcC1Vz"&gt;The ads were reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1364328210771681293?s=20"&gt;More Perfect Union&lt;/a&gt;; their removal was first reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1365007592754466825?s=20"&gt;Rod Breslau&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTaiST"&gt;The ads were the latest entry in a long campaign aimed at disrupting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;organization efforts at an Amazon warehouse outside of Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Those efforts involve pulling employees into mandatory meetings, near-daily texts to employees, relentless anti-union posters in the workplace, and even reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287191/amazon-alabama-warehouse-union-traffic-light-change-bessemer"&gt;changing the timing of traffic lights to disrupt a union drive&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon running the ads on a streaming platform it owns, however, was a very public move. It’s unclear if the company was targeting certain streams or viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiOUkB"&gt;Reached for comment, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) president Stuart Appelbaum denounced the ad. “Amazon feels that it has to go to extremes like this in order to gaslight its workers about the dreadful working conditions at its Bessemer warehouse,” Appelbaum said, “Amazon is leaving no stone unturned - including ads on Twitch - in its efforts to deceive and intimidate their employees into voting against the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbkzhN"&gt;Amazon was not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vE19Pj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon is running a second ad on Twitch in Alabama urging its workers in Bessemer to vote no on the union. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q3wTc0o7Im"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q3wTc0o7Im&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— More Perfect Union (@MorePerfectUS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1364328210771681293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xfhlPP"&gt;The union has also been having its own media push, with &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/02/danny-glover-bessemer-amazon-union-effort-a-strategic-moment-for-labor.html"&gt;actor Danny Glover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1363282664384520193"&gt;Georgia politician Stacey Abrams&lt;/a&gt; encouraging workers to vote “yes.” Both talked about their connection with the South and how their upbringings and parents gave them respect for unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpDr4s"&gt;The unionization fight comes after a string of troubling news for Amazon workers: the company allegedly forced its warehouse workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers"&gt;to work 10-hour overnight shifts&lt;/a&gt;, made plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;install always-on surveillance cameras in its delivery vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;being sued by the state of New York&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to keep its frontline workers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpowZT"&gt;The Alabama unionization vote began on February 8th and is scheduled to conclude on March 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7RPYC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2:46PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added response from the RWDSU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="bRf0fR"&gt;If you missed Target’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295791/xbox-series-x-s-restock-gamestop"&gt;early morning&lt;/a&gt; Xbox Series X restocks today, you have another chance today to secure Microsoft’s next-gen console. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; available for purchase today, February 25th, at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfM933"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; you will have two options to pay for both consoles — with a one-time payment or pay with &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fxbox-all-access%2F8571041&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox All Access&lt;/a&gt;, which requires a monthly payment for 24 months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935894/microsoft-xbox-all-access-bundle-offer-project-scarlett-upgrade-deal"&gt;Xbox All Access is a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that splits the cost of an Xbox console; Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes both versions of the video game streaming service; access to xCloud; and Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AfBWYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ASjwVc"&gt;If you are buying either an Xbox Series X or Series S, there are a few additional items outside of video games you may want to consider purchasing, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive to store your games&lt;/a&gt;, but any games stored through it will not take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zhFeF"&gt;If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2021 12:36PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart plans to restock both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;today. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22065347"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    <title>A $329 Nvidia RTX 3060 was impossible to find, but you could give Newegg’s raffle a try</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3-PwdazZRscIXFarS_Pr3zZt3yM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875373/shollister_200224_4441_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCqybd"&gt;Nvidia &lt;em&gt;supposedly&lt;/em&gt; launched a $329 graphics card today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;the GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve yet to see much proof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDbKA7"&gt;Orders began today at 9AM PT / 12PM ET for a card whose listed prices ranged from $329.99 &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-floods-us-retailers-starting-from-329-to-629"&gt;all the way up to $629.99&lt;/a&gt;, averaging $471. Those aren’t scalper prices, mind you. They’re the retail prices set by Nvidia’s partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lTz8Q"&gt;As far as I can tell, the only places that actually claimed to stock a card for $329.99 were Newegg and EVGA’s own website, and neither simply put the card on sale: Newegg is only raffling off chances to buy the cards, and EVGA has a queue where you hit a “notify me” button. In both cases, you wait for the company to hopefully email you back with good news.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3_3NgODyeeBdicylvMKe2l_grWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328790/newegg_3060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newegg listings pointed you straight to the Newegg Shuffle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eqZqkM"&gt;The raffle and queue are good things, in my opinion! It means you might maybe possibly have a chance to actually get one. You have until 12PM PT / 3PM ET today to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301391%2Fnvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;enter the Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;, which features a PS5 bundle as well, and you’ll know by 2PM PT / 5PM ET if you luck out. But it also means we’ll have little evidence that $329 is the actual price of this GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQCoPd"&gt;There’s also a question of whether Nvidia initially managed to ship many 3060s. Queues and raffles aside, today seemed to have some of the most sparse GPU availability yet, with some accusing Nvidia of a “paper launch” &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-6800-cards-sell-out-instantly-sparking-cries-of-paper-launch"&gt;much like AMD’s RX 6800 series in November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;PCGamer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/news/live/where-to-buy-nvidia-rtx-3060-graphics-card/"&gt;gave up live-blogging the launch&lt;/a&gt; after an hour of failure. Best Buy barely had them. At some other retailers, they never showed up. I saw listings for some versions straight-up pulled off the web. Micro Center only had them in store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kBB1h"&gt;One bright spot (for US gamers anyhow): Best Buy wound up restocking a variety of &lt;em&gt;other &lt;/em&gt;Nvidia GPUs today, with the 3060 Ti, 3070, and even the hardest-to-find 3080 popping up from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RO1N3D"&gt;In fact, it may have shown just how rough the RTX 3060 launch is: I was sitting &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/falcodrin"&gt;Falcodrin’s Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, a popular hangout where people try to track down the cards and share their success, and Falcodrin ran a poll where &lt;em&gt;only two people &lt;/em&gt;admitted to nabbing a 3060 at all:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kE7FT3E2zy5M7r_NWUbtjbTZu4Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328803/falcodrin_poll_600.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcodrin’s poll.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jaNeOp"&gt;It’s also worth noting that at least two of the four supposedly $329.99 graphics cards look suspiciously like token offerings to meet that price. EVGA has a second near-identical version of the 3060 with a very slightly higher boost clock that retails for $390.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NYoPw_FT5gqiSdOjT__oRWh1wmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328825/evga_cards.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll let you guess which one’s the less expensive “Black” model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nNA5JU"&gt;And while Newegg might be listing Zotac’s 3060 Twin Edge for $329.99, Zotac itself lists it and briefly sold &lt;a href="https://www.zotacstore.com/us/zotac-gaming-geforce-rtx-3060-twin-edge-zt-a30600e-10m"&gt;the exact same card&lt;/a&gt; this morning for $479.99. (I saw the add to cart button on one refresh, but Zotac’s website crapped out, and it was out of stock as soon as I returned.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqI2jk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;The RTX 3060 is a good card&lt;/a&gt;, but even at $330, I think you might want to wait and see what’s next since the 3060 Ti is so much better. At $400 and up, that goes double. But maybe you didn’t have a choice to begin with. We’re asking Nvidia if it has more thoughts, and we’ll let you know what we hear. EVGA would only confirm that it’s shipping a $329.99 GPU, and that “we have more supply on the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
