    <title>Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KsLXHf"&gt;It’s been almost a year since Apple first debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;the iPhone 12 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and introduced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21509659/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-charging-magnetic-charger-return"&gt;MagSafe accessory system&lt;/a&gt;. So where are all the MagSafe chargers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDOKq4"&gt;Don’t get me wrong. There are plenty of accessory developers making cases, wallets, car mounts, desk stands, and even magnetic Qi chargers and battery packs that &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; with MagSafe — but almost no actual MagSafe accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bp2oo1"&gt;And that’s a big difference because of how Apple has designed the MagSafe standard. Anyone can wirelessly charge an iPhone 12 device using a Qi charger at Apple’s standard rate of 7.5W. Magnets, being a physical phenomenon, are even more universal, meaning that device manufacturers can easily stick an iPhone 12 and a Qi charger together. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215639/anker-magsafe-qi-charger-apple-alternative-giant-usb-c-plug-explained"&gt;Many already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bevw0"&gt;But those two things alone don’t make a wireless charger a MagSafe charger; actual, Apple-approved MagSafe chargers offer a charging speed that’s twice as fast, up to 15W. And that’s only available on a paltry handful of accessories: Apple’s official charging cable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;Apple’s official MagSafe battery pack&lt;/a&gt; (even then, only when it’s plugged in), and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;pair of pricey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219529/belkin-magsafe-dock-charging-wireless-ces-2021-earbuds"&gt;Belkin stands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KS3fDO"&gt;Theoretically, there’s no reason that Apple &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to restrict 15W charging to official MagSafe chargers. Any number of Qi chargers are available that offer 15W charging speeds and work with a plethora of devices. Some of them are even made by Apple’s MagSafe-approved partners, leading to awkward product lineups where some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fmagsafe-magnetic-accessories%2Fmagsafe%2Fboost-charge-pro-2-in-1-wireless-charger-stand-with-magsafe-15w%2Fp%2Fp-wiz010%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-capable 15W chargers&lt;/a&gt; sit side by side on a website with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fchargers%2Fwireless%2Fcharging-stands-docks%2Fboost-charge-magnetic-wireless-charger-stand-7-5w%2Fp%2Fp-wib003%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;identical-looking 7.5W, MagSafe-compatible wireless chargers&lt;/a&gt; that won’t charge your phone as fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_18Q9UHe7v_NvLYlHc2hVQdvL54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788687/webdam.web.1000.1000.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Belkin charger has MagSafe, costs $99, and charges an iPhone 12 at 15W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GIDwlhonrFGCRfdMXc42emXLDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788689/webdam.web.1000.1000__1_.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Belkin charger has magnets, costs $35, and charges an iPhone 12 at 7.5W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fB2GVg"&gt;The reason appears to be simple: &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;Apple hasn’t actually let anyone else&lt;/a&gt; make MagSafe chargers yet. &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;ChargerLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a wireless-charging-focused site that’s obtained details and a unit for Apple’s MagSafe modules — Apple is only allowing MagSafe chargers to be built using &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/teardown-of-apple-official-15w-magsafe-module/"&gt;an MFi-approved module&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ooeeb"&gt;Much like the Apple Watch charger (and to some extent, Lighting cables), Apple works with factories to provide the basic parts here, which developers can then integrate into a charging station or mount. Technically, there’s not a huge difference between offering a slot for a MagSafe cable versus the integrated module; the advantage is largely in size and cost, allowing for accessories that are smaller, cheaper, and nicer to use than the awkward, kludged-together options we have today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnqAn7VxyxBOup03H8QBLPG85ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788701/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_5.56.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/dont-let-third-parties-confuse-you-about-apples-magsafe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ChargerLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of Apple’s MagSafe module for device makers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2KTD7A"&gt;But crucially, the company only announced that it would be offering the modules &lt;a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/apple-starts-15w-magsafe-wireless-charging-certification/"&gt;on June 22nd&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the iPhone 12 launched. Hardware developers were only then able to apply to get their hands on samples and apply to get true MagSafe products approved (which will presumably take even more time), followed by actually manufacturing and shipping those accessories, which could take months by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gR8Sx1"&gt;It’s a similar timetable that we’ve seen with other proprietary Apple chargers. Apple didn’t offer developers the option to build their own integrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/23/9023443/apple-watch-charging-stands-mfi-program"&gt;until July 2015&lt;/a&gt;, four months after the Watch hit the market, and it took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/26/12271108/diskus-apple-watch-cable-third-party-charger"&gt;almost a year after that&lt;/a&gt; until the first third-party products arrived with the proprietary charger built in. Those products have proven to be excellent options for consumers, offering functionality that Apple didn’t, like integration with other wireless charging pads, removable cables, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/zens-apple-watch-power-bank/"&gt;or a built-in power bank&lt;/a&gt;. But because of how Apple’s system works, it took months for them to arrive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07iaLL"&gt;Or take USB-C to Lightning cables, where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13524272/apple-cutting-usb-c-adaptor-prices-macbook-pro"&gt;first started selling&lt;/a&gt; its own models in fall of 2016 — but only opened the gates to developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/04/mfi-lightning-to-usb-c-cables-early-2019/"&gt;in December 2018&lt;/a&gt;, with the first cables showing up a few months later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/15/18183251/anker-usb-c-to-lightning-cables-release-date"&gt;in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1m8ul"&gt;Each time, that slow start has had direct consequences: a lack of diversity and competition in the products you can buy. Apple’s virtual monopoly on accessories in the first months or years means customers have fewer — and worse — options for their brand-new iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSNFXr"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231718/magsafe-car-chargers-apple-iphone-certification-process"&gt;still no MagSafe car mounts&lt;/a&gt; that will charge your iPhone 12 at full speed, even a year after launch — perhaps the most blindingly obvious use of MagSafe. The closest Apple-sanctioned accessory is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"&gt;magnetic car mount&lt;/a&gt; that just holds up (but doesn’t charge) your phone. And if you want a MagSafe charger for your desk or nightstand that can prop your iPhone up, you’re limited to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2F3-in-1-wireless-charging-stand-magsafe-apple-exclusive%3Fcpn%3D12608711214%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw3_KIBhA2EiwAaAAlimkyPkeNamF7rAVdkW8eCMAHyfvjyAeo2y9m2RW2yf7UOV3mIn4WHxoCJbQQAvD_BwE%26kw%3D%26mkwid%3D_dc%26pcrid%3D509075182700%26pkw%3D%26pmt%3D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bulkier workarounds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twelvesouth.com%2Fproducts%2Fforte-for-iphone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22629703%2Fapple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that require&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://nomadgoods.com/products/magsafe-mount-silver" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;threading through&lt;/a&gt; an existing Apple-bought cable (or Belkin’s two options, which are usually even pricier). Apple spent the better part of the year without giving access to developers to build their own products, while also not working to build anything on its own to fill those niches, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B1PBRs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six months later, there still isn’t a MagSafe car charger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22387722/apple-magsafe-belkin-car-vent-mount-pro-review-no-charger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iML5YK"&gt;And while developers can try to keep up with Apple, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297307/anker-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack-apple-iphone"&gt;Anker’s MagSafe-compatible battery pack&lt;/a&gt;, they’re not playing on a level field without access to the MagSafe modules that Apple is rationing out. Forget Apple’s software additions that make its MagSafe battery pack more useful than a third-party option: right now, Apple’s pack is the only one that can even charge an iPhone at full speed, and even then, only while it’s plugged in with specific adapters and capable cords. It’s the sort of area where competition could lead to better products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyr6PY"&gt;Maybe a third-party can figure out a way to provide full-speed charging from a battery pack that Apple didn’t, or simply offer things at a lower price point or with a larger battery than Apple’s pack offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DNzDx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proprietary Apple chargers are nothing new&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VyjqMY"&gt;That, of course, assumes that Apple even lets competitors make officially approved MagSafe battery packs. The company’s MFi program means that developers have to get their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;hardware approved by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and be built using Apple-approved parts from Apple-approved factories. (Apple also gets a fee from each product, of course.) And if the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;company doesn’t like a design&lt;/a&gt;, it can simply &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;withhold its seal of approval&lt;/a&gt; and the necessary parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWrz29"&gt;Of course, proprietary Apple chargers are nothing new, and while today’s MagSafe licensing feels slow, it’s better than things used to be. The original iteration of MagSafe on laptops wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/185781/magsafe.html"&gt;licensed out to third party companies&lt;/a&gt; at all: if you wanted a spare charger or to charge your Mac from an external battery pack, you were pretty much out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAlVX5"&gt;The most famous example of this is accessory maker Sanho, which famously bought $79 MagSafe chargers, disassembled them, and used the original cable to allow Mac owners to charge their computers with its &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/202098/hypermacbatteries.html"&gt;HyperMac batteries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/09/apples-magsafe-lawsuit-tests-limits-of-first-sale-doctrine/"&gt;Apple then sued Sanho&lt;/a&gt;, which was forced to come up with a workaround that instructed customers to buy their own chargers and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/hypermac-sidesteps-apple-patent-headache-with-diy-solutions/?comments=1"&gt;modify the cables themselves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EH87fY"&gt;But a year out, it’s hard to feel like MagSafe isn’t a missed opportunity for Apple. When the iPhone 12 first came out, MagSafe looked like a way for the company to build an ecosystem of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;snap-on modular accessories&lt;/a&gt;, the sort of thing that Motorola had tried and failed to accomplish with its Moto Mods system. There were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515789/apple-portless-iphone-magsafe-wireless-charging"&gt;visions of port-less iPhones&lt;/a&gt; that could rely on MagSafe exclusively for charging and connecting to external devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnO5e8"&gt;But instead of that thriving new accessory ecosystem, Apple has effectively left us with a handful of Apple-designed cables. It makes Apple’s magnetic standard look less like a stepping stone to the portless future, and more like another brick in Apple’s walled garden. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the minds behind Rez and Death Stranding turned virtual worlds into physical spaces</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;At Virtual Realms: Videogames Transformed, game designers tackle a new realm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rQorJN"&gt;When you build a procedural tree of life, there are going to be branches. This was a learning process for the Irish artist David OReilly, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5857458/mountain-game"&gt;existential simulation games&lt;/a&gt; started making their way into galleries around the world. &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;, which was long-listed for an Academy Award, was launched in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The game allows players to control, bond, and shift between objects at various scales, from subatomic particles to land animals and planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc1pfC"&gt;“To make &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt;, it involved making this incredibly detailed library of objects,” OReilly says. “And so all the interaction was done by having a really big catalog of things, along with information about their relationship with other objects: their color variation, their size, their sound effects, how they move, and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MpevV"&gt;This came in handy when OReilly was asked to translate his virtual worlds into physical art installations. &lt;a href="http://www.davidoreilly.com/eye-of-the-dream"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eye of the Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an adaptation of this remarkable library of metadata, an audio-reactive Kaleidoscopic film for 360 domes and planetaria. OReilly calls it an &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; branch because of how it grew out of the game’s development repository. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Kj7h"&gt;Initially, &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Dream&lt;/em&gt; was engineered to be more interactive, with the simulation parameters controlled by a website on participant’s smartphones. “But once it was put in practice, it was total chaos,” OReilly says. “You have this very harmonious simulation experience with all of this beautiful music, but when you have 100 people with controllers on their phones in the darkness, you get a lot of people going back and forth from zero to 100 over and over again to figure out what their level of control is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54dvWp"&gt;As a result, &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Dream&lt;/em&gt; toured Europe and America as a recording of this algorithm, a “&lt;a href="http://www.davidoreilly.com/eye-of-the-dream"&gt;ballet choreographed by math&lt;/a&gt;” to which observers could surrender. The interactive infrastructure was left behind, but it wasn’t long before another branch sprouted from the &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; tree. &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt;, a collaboration between OReilly and media designers onedotzero, is currently on display at Singapore’s ArtScience Museum as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/museum/exhibitions/virtual-realms.html"&gt;Virtual Realms: Videogames Transformed&lt;/a&gt; exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PclDlh"&gt;Virtual Realms is a bold opportunity for video game developers to transpose their virtual worlds into physical space, confronting new challenges and exploring the medium’s boundaries. As well as gazing into OReilly’s &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt;, attendees will be able to experience installations from Kojima Productions (&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;), Enhance (&lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;/em&gt;), thatgamecompany (&lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;), Media Molecule (&lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet&lt;/em&gt;), and Tequila Works (&lt;em&gt;Rime&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3B1vcW"&gt;Instead of 100 people fighting the algorithm from their phone screens, OReilly’s &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt; offers three oversized discs that participants can spin to scale and warp a mandala of assets like flowers, shells, and cars. Music from the London Symphony Orchestra reacts to the simulation, with non-interactive participants lounging on spongey seats, basking in its infinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdO9Od"&gt;OReilly has long been inspired by the abstract animator Oskar Fischinger, who synchronized films to jazz and classical music in the early 20th century. “This is very much taking the game engine and the codebase but interacting with it more like you’d interact with a musical instrument,” OReilly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZZYt8h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The game is spinning out from the digital world.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YFX4Bw"&gt;Virtual Realms was curated by Enhance’s Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who OReilly calls “the master of audiovisual interactive experiences.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"&gt;Mizuguchi has pushed the medium forward throughout his career by attempting to summon feelings of synesthesia in players&lt;/a&gt;. In his 2001 rail shooter &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt;, Mizuguchi managed this by combining abstract visuals, eclectic dance music, and strong haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57pjhE"&gt;Mizuguchi’s pedigree meant that reaching out to potential collaborators was an easy process. Working with London performing arts center The Barbican, he made a list of designers and artists with ambitions beyond the broad strokes of video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXCb4T"&gt;The response was immediate; as soon as they heard the concept, developers were attracted to the unique challenge of turning their virtual visions into something that people could experience in meatspace. “The game is spinning out from the digital world,” Mizuguchi says. “This is a very deep architecture, one that is unlimited, and we are growing as technology evolves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="awfMrD"&gt;Enhance’s contribution to Virtual Realms is a collaboration with media artists Rhizomatiks called &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt;, which Mizuguchi describes as “an experiment to crystallize the game mechanism of &lt;em&gt;Rez&lt;/em&gt; into a real spatial experience.” Four participants enter a dark room and wield haptic spheres. When they move around the space and interact with others, music and visuals react in real time, building a unique synesthetic performance. “It’s the same mechanism as a game, but with much more freedom,” Mizuguchi says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSc055"&gt;For Enhance, it was about stimulating as many senses as possible. “We are trying to make a new kind of emotional chemistry that is not only emotional but emotional and physical,” Mizuguchi says. “It’s a new kind of storytelling, a synesthetic experiential narrative … where the visuals and sound become borderless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiZlAO"&gt;Ayahiko Sato of Rhizomatiks said that it took countless adjustments to get the audio and visuals in tune with each other to create “sounds which can be seen and visuals that can be heard and felt.” Mizuguchi hopes that &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt; will move people in a way that they can’t explain, inviting them into the world of video games by showing them what the medium is truly capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6u5nH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are trying to make a new kind of emotional chemistry.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6qUjVZ"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; is about a 90-minute to three-hour experience in general, or maybe five or six hours if you want to unlock everything,” OReilly says. But when designing physical adaptations, the conventional rules of video games have to change. “In a gallery, you don’t know when people will enter and leave, so you adapt the systems for that and unlock more things, as there’s no start or endpoint. You let go of control,” OReilly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNJAWB"&gt;Anyone who visits Virtual Realms during its proposed world tour will experience their own version of &lt;em&gt;Eye&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt; due to how the installations have been designed. “I think that ephemeral quality makes each moment unique to what you’re able to see of it,” OReilly says. “It’s not something you can do with other forms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYXJdJ"&gt;Without the comfort of conventional controllers, installations present a challenge for exhibitors, but the breathing room and immersion that physical space provides can be liberating. “I had spent, you know, the better part of 15 years, releasing everything online, with things being part of people’s internet experience,” OReilly says. “But I felt like that hit a certain limit, a saturation point, where there’s just too many things going on, and it’s very difficult to create this kind of experience I want when it might be one tab away from social media or the news or whatever, so I really love the idea of doing it in a physical space.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="w7tOF9"&gt;“I completely took the entire roof off, but if it had rained, my house would be ruined.” John Beech is tilting his webcam to show me the makeshift ceiling above his head. A former construction worker turned lead designer at Media Molecule, his past experience was a boon when developing the studio’s Virtual Realms installation, &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAjRFr"&gt;“The knowledge of what I knew as a builder actually really helped, especially with the early development of &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; when we hooked up with Marshmallow Laser Feast, who are very much in that physical realm,” Beech explains. “I could be that bridge between them and the artists and audio people from Media Molecule, both with my sense of physicality and my experience making stuff in &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnNbHL"&gt;Marshmallow Laser Feast is an experimental design collective based in London known for crafting exhibits that blend cutting-edge technology with physical space. Accordingly, &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a dark room and has participants donning helmets and waving giant soft play shapes in front of an interactive screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0gcSLa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nothing was right, and nothing was wrong.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8QA3c"&gt;Robin McNicholas of Marshmallow Laser Feast called it “exploding the game controller and distributing it in space.” The combined vision for &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; was one of regression. Beech says Media Molecule wanted to break down the structural barriers that form with age and inhibit the childlike wonder of play. “You would go into a soft play amusement area, and nothing was right, and nothing was wrong,” Beech says. “You picked up some shapes; you fiddled around here; there was no sort of structure to it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJWWwI"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; props are embedded with trackers which interface with a virtual environment that Media Molecule built entirely in &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, the studio’s latest commercial release, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21136244/dreams-ps4-game-creation-tool-exposure-problem-curation-media-molecule"&gt;PlayStation-based game creation engine&lt;/a&gt;. “It really does just run off a PS4; there isn’t any sort of cheating in that sense,” Beech says. All of the development took place using DualShock 4s and PlayStation Move controllers. The only external tweak was allowing &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; to interpret the tracking coordinates on the soft play props, but even then, the data was fed to an in-game gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TWcDh"&gt;The development of &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; raises an interesting discussion about the democratization of interactive art. Beech says that &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; users and indie game developers could easily make their own art installations out of the box, pointing to how others have interpreted the engine for their own means. “One of our audio coders, Bogdan [Vera], he took &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihF5WQdtyaM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; to something called Algorave&lt;/a&gt;, which is like a cool generative rave synth party scene,” Beech says. “And he did it with the music tools in &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rel753"&gt;Media Molecule’s intake of motion capture data for &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; is something that isn’t possible in the public version of &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;, but Beech says the studio is always looking for ways to expand the engine’s digital toolset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFjssN"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; is definitely not a finished project,” Beech says. “We will keep adding cool features that will hopefully facilitate ways to use &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; in more and more ways that people don’t expect … we’re hoping people won’t have to necessarily hack it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqOT4G4f_Fy0PzU3tZlkOZPXJAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787496/Dream_Shaping_2021_in_PLAY__Photo_credit_to_Marina_Bay_Sands_.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="x3PFoK"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic also caused serious problems for the Virtual Realms exhibit. Mizuguchi mentioned that after initial meetings in Tokyo to discuss the idea, he couldn’t regroup with local collaborators like Hideo Kojima due to the impact of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZ48to"&gt;Testing ambitious installations in quarantine also demanded creative solutions. Enhance and Rhizomatiks simulated the &lt;em&gt;Rezonance&lt;/em&gt; installation space in virtual reality, all the way down to the position of its many speakers. The two teams used Oculus Quest 2 headsets to walk through the virtual venue and fine-tune audio spatiality and visuals, though they naturally had to compromise when it came to testing high-end haptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGA2um"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m excited to have something that will bring people physically together.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KawWny"&gt;Media Molecule’s work on &lt;em&gt;Dream Shaping&lt;/em&gt; started before the pandemic, but the project faced its own challenges due to remote collaboration. “We were doing it pre-COVID, but it may as well have been because we were in two separate offices,” says Media Molecule’s John Beech. “Marshmallow Laser Feast ran around with the shapes doing random stuff, but not knowing what they were interacting with, and they sent back that recorded data which we could then play as like a replay that informed &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt; what to do,” Beech explains. “So you would see if it was technically working, but you wouldn’t be able to see if, in the game scenario, people would respond to the interaction,” Beech added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6wmNN"&gt;Unable to attend in person, many developers will have to wait for restrictions to lift or until the exhibition tours their part of the world. Meanwhile, they just have to trust that visitors, game-savvy or not, will respond to their unique installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEwKBS"&gt;OReilly’s former work in glitch art has steeled him for any potential errors. “In general, with my work, you acknowledge that it has a digital origin, so you know parts of these errors are part of the experience. But at the same time, you want the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; errors; you want the right kind of accidents,” OReilly says. “We go and see musicians live because on some level, there’s a potential that an accident will happen and that it won’t be exactly like the album you’ve been listening to, and it’s the same here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otX3Xb"&gt;As the world starts to tentatively open up, social experiences like Virtual Realms provide a way for people to reconnect after spending so much time in lockdown, which can be profound for creators, too. “A lot of this comes out of concentrated periods of time between me and the computer,” OReilly says. “And even though this project was set back by all of this, I’m excited to have something that will bring people physically together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RLQpeG"&gt;“This is a young medium that’s totally undeniable and an absolutely natural evolution of all artistic forms that have come before it,” said OReilly. “And it can produce emotional effects that nothing else can do. I don’t particularly care how the intellectuals parse these things, but I know that people will come away from [Virtual Realms] with a feeling that they’ve never had from any other kind of art form before, and that’s its power. “&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to turn off unwanted ‘memories’ in Apple Photos, Google Photos, and Facebook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gsmAx8Ipp_Y86f-eylq2xg2n1o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742560/akrales_191007_3710_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbCiHm"&gt;The memory machines that Apple, Facebook, and Google have built to remind us of our favorite moments can, like any algorithmic creation, serve up subpar output. Instead of evoking recollections of those times we felt like we were living our best lives, they can invoke the low points of our existence — a miserable job, a rotten commute, a bad breakup, or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7iGuo"&gt;Apple Photos, Facebook, and Google Photos provide tools to manage what their “memories” features can push out to you. But these settings to control what pictures and posts get algorithmically bubbled up to your screen aren’t always easy to find — even, in some situations, after these apps have presented a gut-punch of a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdElfi"&gt;Here’s how to control, at least in part, what memories you will see in each of these apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9nb5kG"&gt;Apple Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="smUYpj"&gt;If you’re using iOS 14, Apple’s implementation of its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207023"&gt;Memories feature&lt;/a&gt; provides less control compared to those offered by the other two companies here. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;once you move to iOS 15 later this year&lt;/a&gt;, that should change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oYB2YS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an iOS 14 device:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THgyn0"&gt;If Photos presents you with a memory you’d rather avoid, long-press the video or photo and then tap on the “Suggest Fewer Memories Like This” button below the photo… and hope for the best, as iOS 14 does not provide options to exclude certain people or dates from its Memories feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OjTPK9"&gt;You can also go to the “For You” section of Photos (found at the bottom of your screen), find the photo or video you want to avoid, and long-press it to get the same menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uC9kvj"&gt;To stop Photos from notifying you of new Memories, open the Settings app, select “Notifications” &amp;gt; “Photos” &amp;gt; “Memories” and toggle off “Allow Notifications.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6Nv1wW"&gt;If you’ve added the Photos widget to your iPhone’s homescreen, pictures from your Featured Photos memory collection can also show up there. To remove one from that list, tap and hold it until a menu appears, then scroll down and tap on “Remove from Featured Photos.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DP18bP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On an iOS 15 device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBNBRm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;upcoming iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; operating system adds an option to feature a particular person less often in Memories, or delete that person entirely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OWywTa"&gt;In the Photos app, tap on the Albums icon at the bottom of the screen, and then tap on People (under “People &amp;amp; Places”). Select the person whose Memories you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="spWHT5"&gt;Tap on the three dots at the top right. You’ll get a pop-up menu that lets you, among other things, feature that person less or remove them from the “People” list entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rLADi6"&gt;If you tap on “Feature This Person Less,” you’ll get two choices: to feature that person less in Memories or never feature them at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ciZr9H"&gt;If you tap on “Remove This Person from People,” you’ll be invited to reset the people album, which will clear it of all names and favorites from all your iCloud-connected devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iOS 15 will offer more say over your Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WodsTmSXw1SSvm6I7SFfdY-C6pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788062/IMG_A114459CB882_1.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3F0tcN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a Mac &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="McA7an"&gt;Right-click on the photo and select “Suggest Fewer Memories Like This” to get fewer such reminders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ICByer"&gt;To stop the operating system from notifying you of new Memories, go to the Photos menu at the top left-hand corner of the screen, select “Preferences…” and under the “General” tab, uncheck the box next to “Show Memories Notification.” You can also uncheck “Show Holiday Events” if holiday photos are a special irritation for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right-click on a photo to suggest that it no longer appear in your Memories." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4FK3lw6I7Pr_XmWBZUFXceuiAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788111/Screen_Shot_2021_08_17_at_2.16.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right-click on a photo to suggest that it no longer appear in your Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tjsxcc"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e9jrsn"&gt;The social network took a few months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8284703/facebook-on-this-day-nostalgia-recap"&gt;launching its nostalgia inducer as “On This Day” in 2015&lt;/a&gt; to add the ability to filter out people or dates. The tool has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/25/16202094/facebook-on-this-day-update-seasonal-monthly-recap-memories"&gt;built out since then&lt;/a&gt; and is now called Memories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krRmIt"&gt;You can use either the web app or the mobile app to change your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Hsehnl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The web app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wIJEta"&gt;Select “Memories” in the left-hand column (you may have to click on “See More” to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lAcQfV"&gt;Click on “Hide People” or “Hide Dates” on the left. &lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Besides hiding people or dates, you can choose how often to be notified about Memories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="762bAN"&gt;Whether you’re on a mobile device or a desktop, you can now type in the names of any people you don’t want in your Memories, or any dates you want to exclude. Note when you type in a name, you may sometimes get public pages or profiles of random strangers before you get the names of friends — at least, that was my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrGLNs"&gt;One item you can’t exclude from Memories: posts from other people who tagged you in them. (Consider this paragraph a feature request, Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4nPVW"&gt;The Memories settings screens also let you regulate how often Facebook notifies you of new Memories: a maximum of once a day, algorithmically chosen highlights, or never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orhdTM"&gt;Google Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ve1m6c"&gt;The Memories feature Google added to Google Photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20860938/google-photos-memories-prints-cvs-walmart-canvas"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; also offers options to hide people (and pets) or dates from your notifications of past events that bubble up in its mobile apps. The Photos web app doesn’t offer those settings because it doesn’t push notifications to your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g51Klu"&gt;On the mobile Google Photos app, tap the account-profile picture at the top right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="07qt64"&gt;Tap “Photos settings” (in Android) or “Google Photos Settings” (on Apple devices). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7fSqQk"&gt;Tap “Memories.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E08zPw"&gt;Tap “Hide people &amp;amp; pets” to remove one from these flashbacks. This will be easier if you’ve already added names to the faces that Google Photos automatically recognizes and classifies. And if Google Photos misses a picture of somebody — say, if it was taken at a strange angle or in poor light — it can still resurface in Memories. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oI8skK"&gt;The “Hide dates” tool (also on the “Memories” page) is far simpler. Tap “Hide Dates,” and select the day or days you want gone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aRqYt5"&gt;To have Google Photos stop notifying you about some or all Memories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Hk1L0h"&gt;Tap the “Notifications” link on the Memories page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vcwueM"&gt;On the next page, look for the “Memories” section. Here, you can opt out of having Google Photos nudge you about on-this-day memories from previous years or “Themed memories” (like the “They grow up so fast” compilations of pictures of my daughter that it somehow knows to push when a work trip has me away from my family).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Waymo is building a hub for its autonomous trucks in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VuxP7ZjFLiEF8dqiiqJ83Elp98o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742176/vpavic_191202_3827_0042.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3nXuIa"&gt;Waymo announced plans to build a hub for its autonomous semi-trailer trucks on a nine-acre site near Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. The Alphabet-owned company also said it is partnering with rental truck company Ryder on fleet management as it looks to grow the delivery and logistics portion of its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Pgsjd"&gt;The hub in South Dallas will be Waymo’s “primary operations center” in the state for its fleet of autonomous trucks. The hub will be built to accommodate “hundreds of trucks and personnel” as the company gets closer to launching a full-scale freight-hauling operation using its fully autonomous vehicles — though Waymo has yet to say exactly when that will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wjcnqg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“primary operations center”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8ljza"&gt;Currently, Waymo is testing the fifth generation of its “Driver,” which is the term used to describe its combination of hardware, sensors, and AI software, on its fleet of Class 8 trucks. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527430/waymo-jb-hunt-autonomous-truck-freight-test-texas"&gt;working with JB Hunt Transport Services&lt;/a&gt; to haul freight along several interstates in Texas. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;Waymo is continuing its work with Daimler&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, on a fully autonomous, Level 4 system for trucks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJ_rU_F0unAiNBvFPmnAiEKiCs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787793/Waymo_Via_facility.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syWFP0"&gt;While much of the public’s focus has been on Waymo’s autonomous minivans that operate in Arizona as part of a limited ride-hailing service, less attention has been paid to the company’s stated plans to eventually launch a commercial freight hauling business. Waymo has a modest fleet of Peterbilt trucks that have been retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors and software, and it is currently testing them in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078438/waymo-self-driving-minivans-trucks-texas-new-mexico"&gt;Arizona, California, and Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79DABw"&gt;The trucks operate autonomously during tests and commercial deliveries but include two Waymo employees, a commercially licensed driver, and a software engineer, who sit in the cab and monitor the driving. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e9FGOGT_fYnw5XEkPbnWh1M84SM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787794/Ryder_Waymo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7uskpr"&gt;Waymo also said it would be teaming up with Ryder, one of the nation’s largest rental truck operators, for help with fleet management services. This will include fleet maintenance, inspections, and roadside assistance — though both companies see opportunities for future services. Waymo has similar deals for its robotaxi fleet in Arizona and California &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17762326/waymo-self-driving-ride-hail-fleet-management"&gt;with Avis and AutoNation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wKBFU"&gt;Waymo has been working on autonomous trucks since 2017 and plans to eventually launch a full-scale freight hauling and delivery service called Waymo Via. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-17/waymo-s-self-driving-cars-are-99-of-the-way-there-the-last-1-is-the-hardest?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; detailed many of the company’s struggles to grow beyond the experimental phase into a commercially viable business. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve Minutes is a strange interactive thriller that’s better with friends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTZNe0riZ1sNuV9hzW0BzWTDJQ0=/60x0:1860x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742105/TwelveMinutes_Screenshot_03__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e2sjbN"&gt;I’m not sure I could’ve solved the intricate mystery of &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; on my own. The interactive thriller — which boasts a star-studded cast including James McAvoy, Daisy Ridley, and Willem Dafoe — forces players to relive the same short span of time repeatedly. Over that time you’ll die repeatedly at the hands of Dafoe, but during each loop you’ll also pick up some tiny new breadcrumb of information to help explain what’s happening. It can be frustrating, with fiddly controls and an ending that goes completely off the rails. But as a group experience, it’s a lot of fun; even though it’s technically a single-player game, I found myself sharing ideas and theories with my partner, and it was helpful having an extra pair of eyes to spot clues I might’ve missed. &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; can be tedious and repetitive — but like most games, it’s much better with a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlhrtc"&gt;The game starts out simple enough. &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; opens with an unnamed man, played by McAvoy, arriving at his apartment in the early evening. He’s greeted by his wife, voiced by Ridley, who has a special night planned. She’s made his favorite dessert and is going to break some big news while they eat. The romantic evening is quickly interrupted by a man claiming to be a cop (Dafoe) breaking in and arresting the woman for murdering her father. He then demands to see a pocket watch, and when the wife refuses, the cop starts to choke her husband to death. Upon dying, McAvoy’s character returns to his front door, 12 minutes earlier, as if nothing happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OG8BHA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uob80LBVgzA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="22W8OJ"&gt;As the title implies, that brief loop is the core of &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes. &lt;/em&gt;The entirety of the game takes place during that window of time and inside of the couple’s small apartment. If you try to leave through the front door, it resets. If the cop kills you — which he will, repeatedly, with his bare hands and with weapons — it restarts. You can’t change that, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use that time to search for information. And you do this by experimenting, using the limited options at your disposal to find ways to live those 12 minutes differently. At times, &lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; can almost feel like a really ominous toy, where you’re constantly changing the variables to see what happens, often with grisly results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="kLcFeQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10707224"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3upOpN"&gt;You view the world from an overhead perspective, and the game plays out a bit like an old-school point-and-click adventure. You have the ability to talk to people, pick up certain objects, and interact with a few parts of the apartment. The world is small — there’s just a living room, bathroom, bedroom, and a tiny closet — and you’re relatively limited in terms of what you can do. You can’t, for instance, search through every object in a dresser drawer or dig through the fridge. But those things you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; interact with are usually important and can be combined in different, usually intuitive ways. If you pick up a mug, for instance, you can drag it over to the sink to fill it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIoEPE"&gt;As you play and learn more, your options start to open up. Initially, I had no idea what to do. I tried explaining to the wife that I was in a time loop, but of course she didn’t understand. The small space and limited options felt restrictive. But then I started to experiment. I decided to see what would happen if she got mad, or if she fell asleep, or if I used that big knife as a weapon. Usually I just died, but sometimes I would find something interesting — a hidden item or a phone number — that I knew could be used during the next loop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twelve Minutes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUr18P0MI1REqLL3GS2XtjMAwLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789723/TwelveMinutes_Screenshot_05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Je2LEQ"&gt;The problem is this structure means a lot of repetition. It’s not so bad early on, when everything still feels new, but the further you progress the more the repetition sets in. You’ll hear the same lines of dialogue many times, and often play through near-identical scenarios. Toward the end, as the complexity ratcheted up, I found myself writing a to-do list of everything that needed to happen in the next loop, lest I forget something. It’s really annoying to end up with Willem Dafoe’s hands around your neck because you forgot to lock the door. On consoles these issues are exacerbated by the controls. I played the game on the Xbox Series X, but the interface is clearly designed for a mouse, as you have to drag a cursor around the screen to do just about everything. With a gamepad it’s slow, which is extra frustrating in a game where time is constantly working against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7OUev"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; can be fiddly at times, but it does nail that incredible feeling of slowly unraveling a mystery. Each new breadcrumb is a victory. The game rarely gives you overt clues or hints, so that sense of accomplishment is only more pronounced. This is also what makes it a good game to have someone watch along with you; missing even the tiniest detail can mean getting stuck. And since the game is essentially about experimenting with each loop, it’s a lot of fun to toss around wild ideas with someone else, in hopes of finding a new route. Unfortunately, while the world and story initially feel very grounded — aside from all the time travel — things get a bit too outlandish toward the end. I’ve been thinking about it for two days, and the game’s ending still doesn’t make much sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfknXq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twelve Minutes&lt;/em&gt; tries to do something very specific, and in many ways it succeeds. There are few games where solving a mystery feels so playful and organic, and the game does a great job at creating tension. My heart always started racing when I heard the elevator open in the hallway, knowing the cop was about to barge in. But those good parts are muddied by the often tedious structure and an ending that is more unbelievable than shocking. Your enjoyment will depend mostly on your tolerance for repetition — and if you have any mystery-loving friends to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9YshP"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Twelve Minutes &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches August 19th on Xbox and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s attempt at podcast subscriptions is off to a messy start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIGttswlXfR_80Vgi4KPGb_bWMA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69742072/acastro_210817_4721_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Bugs and design flaws&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HH7MKN"&gt;In April, Apple Podcasts was poised to revolutionize the industry. It announced in-app subscriptions, as well as an entirely new backend, representing one of the most monumental changes to the app since its launch. The hype was easy to understand: the biggest name in podcast apps legitimizing subscriptions could usher in a new podcasting era, one in which ad revenue plays a less essential role and more people could potentially support themselves off their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIttFg"&gt;But in the months since Apple Podcasts’ announcement, podcasters say the platform has failed them in various ways. For a company that prides itself on functionality, design, and ease of use, the new backend’s bungled launch is a mess. Podcasters say Apple Podcasts Connect, which they’re required to use in order to take advantage of subscriptions, has a confusing interface that often leads to user error scenarios that have them pinging Apple at all hours of the day in a panic — one podcaster’s entire show was seemingly archived until Apple stepped in to help and explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXR3se"&gt;The updated app’s been buggy since launch. Earlier this summer, an &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/1418-a-notice-about-download-reports"&gt;auto-download bug&lt;/a&gt; caused a reported 31 percent drop in downloads, according to &lt;a href="https://analytics.podtrac.com/blog/2021/8/9/monthly-podcast-traffic-update-for-july-2021"&gt;Podtrac&lt;/a&gt;. People who relied on Apple to download new episodes for them might have missed them entirely. (The company &lt;a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/1488-whats-new-for-apple-podcasts-with-ios-147"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an update last month that reportedly fixed it, but that solution hinges on people actually updating their app.) Listeners &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/users-despair-at-apple-podcasts-app-after-update/"&gt;also complained&lt;/a&gt; about problems with the app update in April — some say podcasts they had already heard flooded their libraries, and they also had problems syncing their podcasts across devices. It culminated in a slightly delayed launch of the subscription product, pushing it from May to June, some updates, and no public word from Apple on why everything went so wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="99J7qQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple hasn’t offered an explanation for the bugs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JzjELQ"&gt;Worse than bugs, however, podcasters say the subscription push comes with a new labor cost that not all of them can afford to address. The promise of RSS was a centralized place to publish to all podcasting platforms; however, with this new subscription product, as well as other platforms, podcasters now have to publish in a variety of places and manage various backends — a particularly arduous task for small teams. One podcaster says they upload to Patreon, Apple, and their hosting provider right now, and they could end up also uploading to Spotify and other services, too. None of these separate feeds play nicely with each other, so the Patreon private RSS feed can’t be used to automatically upload paid content to Apple — every paid episode has to be uploaded manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwQDnc"&gt;“Apple is coming at it from the lens of a big corporation,” says a podcast manager of an independent show, who prefers to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of their relationship with Apple. “I think it’s harder for them to think about smaller independent shows that have so few people on staff. It’s such a foreign concept to them; they’re Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfQir8"&gt;This manager says they’ve spent days troubleshooting the platform, and at one point, waited a full night for an episode to process on the backend, at which point it was already dated content. On another recent evening, they say they uploaded their exclusive content to Patreon within five minutes, but then waited hours for it to process on Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzDaVw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Small teams are publishing and managing various platforms with few people to help&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3ECjCU"&gt;“That’s one of the consequences of us having a tiny team is like, it’s just me sitting around waiting for it to finish processing, so that I can publish the episode,” they say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY0DYN"&gt;Bigger companies have a better chance of managing the subscription work uptick. They can hire producers to make bonus content, focus on multiple shows at once, and have the monetary resources to make a new project successful. NPR, for example — both an initial Apple subscriptions and Spotify subscriptions launch partner — hired two new people to handle the publishing of its six ad-free subscription shows, says Joel Sucherman, VP of new platform partnerships. They also help with quality checks, like making sure the subscriber feed content doesn’t accidentally have ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxqPT8"&gt;“The beauty of RSS was just publish it [and] it goes everywhere —  it’s just there, and it’s available,” Sucherman says. “And so these additional steps have introduced potential for user error or machine error and sometimes you play a little bit of whack-a-mole trying to figure out which is which, but I would characterize it as growing pains and things that will clearly get better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRCrFj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bigger companies can afford to staff up to handle subscriptions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDtAhA"&gt;Apple’s main podcasting competitor, Spotify, has announced a solution to solve this labor problem in the form of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595013/spotify-open-access-podcasts-paid-access"&gt;Open Access technology&lt;/a&gt;. It says the technology will pair with existing subscription platforms, like Supporting Cast and Memberful, in order to make publishing in one place possible, even for premium content. However, both Apple and Patreon aren’t yet collaborating on the project, and Spotify is only making it available to invited partners right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMwkNo"&gt;“At the point that they do come up with a more automated solution for sending the files, that’ll be awesome,” says Tracy Leeds Kaplan, director of partnerships and operations at Tenderfoot TV, of Apple’s new system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fl1BSa"&gt;Even now, after the subscriptions launch, when one would hope the worst of the platform’s issues had subsided, podcasters say they’re still experiencing other technical glitches, namely, major delays in new episodes publishing. One executive, who prefers to remain anonymous, says one popular show, which is time-sensitive, experienced 72-hour publishing delays on multiple occasions. Another executive, who also prefers to remain anonymous, tells me their show listeners emailed them asking where the new episodes were, all because of Apple’s delay. (In a couple of these cases, the episodes in question weren’t even behind a paywall and relied on the typical RSS system.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1P0dY"&gt;“People get in their routine, and if an episode doesn’t come out when they expected, it’s really easy to move on to a new show,” one of these executives says. “We’ve had fans asking us what was up, and I think that’s a real bad look and really impactful on our numbers which translates to ad sales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ntCZ8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Episode delays means possibly losing listeners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BxU01m"&gt;They also say the subscription product, at least for podcasters themselves, doesn’t feel complete and easy, especially compared to its competitors. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/10/15774936/apple-podcast-analytics-wwdc"&gt;In 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Apple began providing podcasters analytics about their show and episodes, like audience retention, for example, and one would presume those analytics would transfer over to the subscription product. Right now, though, podcasters say they have to download a txt.gz file, or spreadsheet, to view their subscription data. The indie podcast manager says they’re having trouble opening the file and still have no idea how many people are paying for their show, months after the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoJ6e0"&gt;“It’s frustrating because on Patreon, we can just go to a web browser interface and see our numbers — we can do that with anything,” they say. “It just seems overly complicated; why can’t you just put it on the internet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9q8zG0"&gt;One of the podcast executives, who has been able to open this file, still says the existence of a spreadsheet, rather than an accessible, legible backend interface is “not very Apple-like” and “just not really easy to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Jvp01"&gt;This is also a case where bigger networks might have an advantage — their employees, or at least their hires, might be familiar with spreadsheets and pivot tables. Smaller companies, however, likely lack the resources and capabilities, meaning the gap between those who have big budgets and those who don’t widens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EaM05F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The downloaded spreadsheet has been hard for podcasters to parse &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7MxKh"&gt;Other, smaller concerns exist, too, like the fact that podcasters can’t view the number of “followers” a show has or people who follow the show but don’t pay for it. This number is critical for podcasters who want to monitor conversion, like whether they’re turning followers into paying listeners, and can serve as an indicator of a show’s success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xh280i"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCG9v0"&gt;Although Apple didn’t issue a response to these podcasters’ complaints, it’s easy to imagine the company saying that these folks aren’t forced to use the platform. Apple Podcasts has, and still does, support private RSS feeds, meaning people can publish on Patreon, Supporting Cast, or wherever else, and their listeners can enjoy the content within Apple’s world. But that choice comes at a cost: a lack of an in-app button. They’d miss out on the possible key to unlocking a new market of subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TOGMCG"&gt;But the platform’s ongoing problems, and its vocal critics, speak to the industry’s power dynamics. If Apple Podcasts doesn’t publish an episode for a day or two, a podcaster’s month could be ruined, both infuriating their paying subscribers and advertisers. Outsized influence in the industry means outsized scrutiny, and podcasters want answers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest is adding search filters for different hair textures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a Pinterest search for “summer hairstyles” showing filter options for protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight, and shave/ bald. Protective is selected, showing various pins of people with braids and twists. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhctYSvXiaor1l41pZ5CgEO_-oQ=/5x0:4289x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741089/Hair_Pattern_Desktop_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pinterest’s new hair pattern search feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pinterest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rqWv7P"&gt;Pinterest is launching a search tool to help people narrow their hair inspiration searches by hair pattern. When users search for hairstyles, new filter options — for coily, curly, wavy, and straight textures, as well as shaved / bald and protective styles — will appear under the search bar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkFGFb"&gt;The filters should be particularly useful for people of color looking for styles tailored to their hair textures, and Pinterest says they were created with Black, brown, and Latinx people in mind. “Just the simple idea that I don’t have to work twice as hard to find a hairstyle because of my hair type is a game changer,” says Naeemah LaFond, an editorial hair stylist and global artistic director of the Amika hair care brand, who advised Pinterest during the feature’s development. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif showing “summer hairstyles” being typed into Pinterest search and bringing up different pins under the protective and coily filters." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NWjlvJ-5kDSkIVoUtHrXmiD2IxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22787824/Hair_Pattern_Search_Mobile_GIF.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I1wF90"&gt;The new feature builds on Pinterest’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17286898/pinterest-skin-tone-search-filter-results-feature-update"&gt;skin tone search filters&lt;/a&gt;, which were introduced in 2018. To make those filters, Pinterest engineers started with data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131260/loreal-modiface-acquire-makeup-ar-try-on"&gt;ModiFace’s&lt;/a&gt; AI library, adjusting the algorithm from there to improve things like its ability to properly categorize skin tones in low light. Pinterest has made improvements to its in-house tech since then, saying it’s now “three times as likely to detect multiple skin tone ranges in top search results, compared to previous technology.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PPAQp"&gt;Pinterest says the hair pattern feature uses “computer vision-powered object detection” to determine which hair types are shown in hairstyle pins.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We built hair pattern search with in-house AI on top of our foundational computer vision technology that is used in visual search and shopping,” says a Pinterest spokesperson. The company says its algorithm has detected hair patterns in over 500 million images on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1zrR9"&gt;Hair pattern search will be rolling out across desktop, iOS, and Android apps over the coming weeks, says Pinterest. The filters will be available in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand first, before expanding to other countries in the coming months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZrEkU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 18th, 11:02 AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added details about Pinterest’s in-house skin tone and hair pattern detection tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Water shortages loom over future semiconductor fabs in Arizona </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Southwest Faces Worsening Drought Conditions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K5faOSmwGsZzZYe4pYwEKiq4nss=/2x0:4999x3331/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741646/1233861592.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;In an aerial view. an empty water trough in the desert that has been recently visited by wild burros is seen on July 7, 2021 near Yucca, Arizona. Large portions of the West are now classified as being in exceptional drought, the most extreme drought category.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by David McNew/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZLAKw"&gt;Major semiconductor manufacturers looking to expand in Arizona will likely be spared from water cuts induced by an unprecedented water shortage in the Southwest, at least for now.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As part of the scramble to end a shortage of another kind — the global dearth in semiconductor chips — both Intel and TSMC plan to open new facilities in Arizona. But they’re setting up shop just as one of the worst droughts in decades grows worse across the Western US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k33XbY"&gt;Federal authorities officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;declared a shortage&lt;/a&gt; on the Colorado River for the first time ever this week, which will trigger water cuts in several states and Mexico starting January 1st, 2022. The shortage is at the Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the US and a huge source of water for Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5GdcRX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A factory or “fab” for making semiconductors needs a lot of water&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XzQCq8"&gt;How the planned water cuts shake out depends on who is given top priority under a complex set of water-sharing agreements. Arizona, with more junior rights to the water than other states it shares it with, will suffer the biggest cuts, losing about &lt;a href="https://www.cap-az.com/water/cap-water/planning-and-processes/shortage-impacts/"&gt;8 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the total water it receives a year. But for now, those cuts will primarily affect agriculture, which used more than 70 percent of the state’s water &lt;a href="http://www.arizonawaterfacts.com/water-your-facts"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Water for tribes, municipal use, and industry are given higher &lt;a href="https://www.cap-az.com/water/cap-water/planning-and-processes/shortage-impacts/"&gt;priority&lt;/a&gt; in the state, shielding residents and companies unless a more severe water shortage is eventually declared at Lake Mead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWIreR"&gt;A factory or “fab” for making semiconductors needs a lot of water to operate. It’ll guzzle between 2 to 4 million gallons of water a day by some &lt;a href="https://engineeredenvironment.tumblr.com/post/30464844411/water-use-in-the-semiconductor-manufacturing"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;, using the water to cool down equipment and clean silicon wafers. That’s about as much water as 13,698 to 27,397 Arizona residents might use &lt;a href="https://new.azwater.gov/conservation/public-resources"&gt;in a day&lt;/a&gt;. Fabs are also pretty picky when it comes to water quality, they need to use “ultra-pure” water to prevent any impurities from damaging the chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyAmjB"&gt;Industries in the state used up 6 percent of Arizona’s water in 2019, but that could grow as chipmakers and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-southwest-is-americas-new-factory-hub-cranes-everywhere-11622554044"&gt;other manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; move in. In &lt;a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1452/intel-announces-major-expansion-in-arizona"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, Intel announced that it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Chandler, Arizona, an expansion of its existing campus there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jso4S8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arizona has been “vital” to Intel’s operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsUtK"&gt;Last year, the company pledged that by 2030 it will restore and return more freshwater than it uses. It’s nearing that benchmark in Arizona, where Intel says it cleaned up and returned 95 percent of the freshwater it used in 2020. It has its own water treatment plant at its Ocotillo campus in Chandler that’s similar to a municipal plant. There’s also a “brine reduction facility,” a public-private partnership with the city of Chandler, that brings 2.5 million gallons of Intel’s wastewater a day back to drinking standard. Intel uses some of the treated water again, and the rest is sent to replenish groundwater sources or be used by surrounding communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrygKe"&gt;While Intel recycles much of its water, more fabs will mean it will need to send even more water through its systems. The company says that Arizona has been “&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-arizona.html"&gt;vital&lt;/a&gt;” to Intel’s operations for more than four decades. The state is already home to its first “mega-factory network” and its newest semiconductor fab. Intel used more than 5.2 billion gallons of water in Arizona in 2020 — roughly 20 percent of which was reclaimed water, according to its most recent &lt;a href="http://csrreportbuilder.intel.com/pdfbuilder/pdfs/CSR-2020-21-Full-Report.pdf"&gt;corporate responsibility report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFvtnn"&gt;“We continually look for opportunities to minimize our water footprint and will continue to make investments in water conservation and restoration, even as we continue to grow,” Intel said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ocMLY7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464280/skydio-2-x2-3d-scan-photogrammetry"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3D model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcv16-lLsA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a water treatment plant for a new semiconductor facility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in Chandler, Arizona. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hY7ncH"&gt;Chip manufacturing giant TSMC also has its eye on Arizona. In May 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/2033"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to build a $12 billion new fab near Phoenix, which would be its first in Arizona and its second in the US (its first is in Washington state). TSMC could be planning to build up to six new fabs in Arizona over the next 10 to 15 years, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Opu9Pm"&gt;TSMC said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that for now it doesn’t expect the water shortage to have “any impact” on its plan to build a new fab in Arizona, although it says it will “continue to monitor the water supply situation closely.” &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTeLQW"&gt;Most of TSMC’s fabs are in Taiwan, where earlier this year the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/podcasts/story/2021-07-30/the-times-podcast-drought-taiwan-mexico-china"&gt;worst drought&lt;/a&gt; in more than 50 years &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chip-shortage-is-bad-taiwans-drought-threatens-to-make-it-worse-11618565400"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; the already stressed supply chain for chips. TSMC plans to finish construction this year of a new water treatment plant in Taiwan&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that could eventually recycle enough water to supply half of the company’s daily needs, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-tackles-Taiwan-drought-with-plant-to-reuse-water-for-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jS710Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The state is expected to face some tough choices in the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rWKEOv"&gt;While Taiwan still dominates semiconductor manufacturing, Arizona is emerging as a new hub. The Biden administration has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;prioritized&lt;/a&gt; building up a domestic supply of semiconductor chips as the current shortage affects everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602104/chip-shortage-tech-quarterly-earnings-intel-apple-microsoft-amd-samsung-tesla"&gt;phones and game consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Two other companies, NXP and Microchip Inc., have fabs in the state also. NXP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;and Microchip declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbA24Q"&gt;Arizona is notoriously dry, which leaves it dependent on water-sharing agreements with other states. Arizona gets a hefty 38 percent of its water from the Colorado River, and with water from the river running low, the state is expected to face some tough choices in the future.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The state has been in a drought &lt;a href="https://new.azwater.gov/drought/faq#:~:text=A%3A%20Arizona%20has%20been%20in,according%20to%20statewide%20precipitation%20patterns.&amp;amp;text=Unlike%20hurricanes%20and%20tornadoes%2C%20drought,and%20long%2Dterm%20drought%20conditions."&gt;since 1994&lt;/a&gt;, and climate change is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;making things worse&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the vast majority of Arizona faces a “severe” drought, according to the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataTables.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAovEg"&gt;Everyone in the United States who got a COVID-19 vaccine will need a booster shot to keep protection from fading, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccinated Americans will be offered boosters eight months after their initial shots. Plans are that the first round will be offered in September and will go to nursing home residents, healthcare workers, and others vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzKxdh"&gt;“Current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout,” federal health officials said &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html"&gt;in a joint statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MrS1i"&gt;The current proposal only includes the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Officials say they’re expecting additional data to guide decision-making around boosters for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpsIff"&gt;It’s a reversal from early July, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/08/1014438902/despite-new-covid-variants-cdc-says-you-dont-need-any-booster-doses-right-now"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that most people do not need booster shots. It’s also likely to be controversial from a global equity perspective — the majority of people in low-income countries haven’t received first doses yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjP0DL"&gt;The fast-spreading delta variant changed the equation. The administration is concerned that protection against the coronavirus could fade, either because of the passage of time or the variant, officials &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/16/booster-shot-coronavirus/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Preliminary data out of Israel, published as &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.21261317v1.full.pdf"&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; that have not undergone peer review and through &lt;a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/05072021-03"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Health, suggests the vaccine became less effective at preventing COVID-19 infections and symptomatic cases in the face of the country’s delta surge. &lt;a href="https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/vpb-12082021/he/files_publications_corona_vpb-12082021-01.pdf"&gt;Data released&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Health also suggested efficacy against severe cases of COVID-19 may be eroding for older adults. Israel is offering booster doses to people 60 years of age and older.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYAgcw"&gt;Data from the United States also shows vaccine effectiveness against coronavirus infections declining over time, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing. The shots are also less effective against infections from the delta variant, CDC data shows: effectiveness declined from 92 percent before the delta variant to 64 percent with the delta variant in one US group, Walensky said. Protection against severe cases of COVID-19, hospitalization, and death remain high. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CLfitGBRaDxRjkdopwUC84z70-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790147/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_11.33.24_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data presented in a press briefing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0vOLEk"&gt;Still, there’s no data yet showing if the booster would offer additional protection against delta. A third dose generates &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-third-shot-booster-11623421703"&gt;higher levels of antibodies&lt;/a&gt; against the virus, but it’s not clear if or how much that would translate to additional protection against COVID-19. Pfizer has a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04955626?term=BNT162b2&amp;amp;draw=2&amp;amp;rank=8"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; testing that question underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMMyPN"&gt;Even if boosters can improve protection for fully vaccinated people, that wouldn’t do as much to blunt COVID-19 surges as would vaccinating more people in the US, Boston University epidemiologists Eleanor Murray and Ruby Barnard-Mayers &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/coronavirus-vaccine-booster-shots/2021/08/11/aefec5dc-fae0-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Only 62 percent of US adults are fully vaccinated. There are still no COVID-19 vaccines authorized for kids under 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3BKJM"&gt;Although the Biden administration announced the plan today, booster shots can’t roll out without clearance from the FDA and recommendation from the CDC. There are no booster shots currently authorized by the FDA, though once the agency fully approves the vaccines (which it’s expected to do by early September), physicians would have more flexibility to distribute additional doses. Pfizer submitted initial data on booster doses to the FDA this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i0h1R"&gt;The CDC recommended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623600/cdc-covid-third-vaccine-immunocompromised"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that people with compromised immune systems get third doses of either the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, as many don’t produce enough antibodies after the regular series. That third dose isn’t considered a booster — it’s an expanded initial vaccine regimen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rb1Pn"&gt;Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-calls-moratorium-covid-19-vaccine-booster-doses-until-september-end-2021-08-04/"&gt;called for a moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on COVID-19 vaccine boosters until the end of September so that more vaccine supply could make it to low-income countries. There are huge gaps in vaccine access between high and low-income countries — only around 1 percent of people in low-income countries have received even one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4bxie"&gt;“This is a global pandemic and we need to think about global solutions,” Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID-19 technical lead at the WHO, told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;. “All of the world’s most vulnerable, and those who are most at-risk — health workers — need to receive their first and second doses before a large proportion of the population or all of the population in some countries receive that third dose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVoVl5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ latest trailer shows off big changes for battles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legendary Pokemon Arceus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kxh_F08EeuFORJ2YLrmad8ULcSc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69741591/Switch_PokemonLegendsArceus_Screenshot__17_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdG7YW"&gt;Nintendo announced a ton of new information for the hotly anticipated &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; during today’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kdja9m4YlT4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;Presents&lt;/a&gt; showcase. In addition to covering a new battle system, new regional pokémon, and the new skills trainers will need to catch ‘em all, Nintendo also released a brand-new, beautiful trailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7dZAX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legend: Arceus &lt;/em&gt;takes place in the Hisui region — a natural paradise filled with different ecosystems and stuffed all kinds of regional pokémon. Your goal is to help the Galaxy Expedition Team study and catalog the pokémon of the region by compiling the very first Pokédex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ze49yD"&gt;Nintendo offered a glimpse into &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;battle system, which combines classic pokémon gameplay with a couple of new twists. One new feature is the Action Order bar that displays which pokémon’s turn is next. You can influence turn order and frequency by using attacks that fall into either the strong style or the agile style category. Strong style moves hit harder but are slower and increase the amount of time between your next attack. Agile style moves are weaker but faster and using them will give you multiple opportunities to attack in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHPZge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; also showcased the different kinds of pokémon inhabiting the Hisui region. Like &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sword&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends&lt;/em&gt; will feature regional variants of pokémon who have specially adapted to life in the Hisui region. Some of these local variants, like the Hisuian braviary or the spirit possessed basculegion, will let you ride them to cross the vast and varied landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsGI9A"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; is a bold new direction for the beloved monster-catching franchise. The game’s emphasis on freely roaming through swaying grass as little bidoofs jump about has already drawn comparisons to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. It seems that Nintendo wants to break the familiar format of previous &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games by giving players a gorgeous pokémon-stuffed world and the leisure to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czd6KW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus &lt;/em&gt;comes to the Nintendo Switch on January 28th, 2022.  &lt;/p&gt;
