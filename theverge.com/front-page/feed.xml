    <title>Turtle Beach is making dedicated flight sim hardware for PC and Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach VelocityFlight One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B3qi0f5R1SWbSJIM4OnzRZWQMgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451518/tb_velocityone_flight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, it costs nearly as much as a Series X, but look at it!&lt;/em&gt; | Turtle Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VQuya2"&gt;Gaming peripheral company Turtle Beach announced at E3 2021 that it’s getting into a new product category: flight sim hardware. The company is launching the VelocityOne Flight system for $350, and it’s compatible with PC and Xbox consoles via USB. And, for a first effort in this competitive space, it seems like a very comprehensive offering and a decent value if you’re into playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV2eqt"&gt;The VelocityOne Flight was made in collaboration with aeronautical engineers and pilots to provide a realistic flight experience. It has a 180-degree yoke handle with rear rudder controls for easy access. To its right, there’s a modular throttle quadrant with an integrated trim wheel, as well as both vernier-style and lever controls (with swappable tops for prop and jet planes). All in all, Turtle Beach says the VelocityOne Flight features 12 analog axes, two POV switches, two four-way HAT switches, and 18 extra buttons that can be mapped to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach VelocityFlight One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oj2u8CxqZwCsPi8Gzl2KadW7q9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657812/velocityflightone_screen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BRmCZz"&gt;In addition to controls, this hardware includes a 3.5mm jack on its left side for private listening. To deepen immersion (and to avoid having to push multiple buttons when you just want to fly and chill) the yoke has a display that can show stats like flight time, time at destination, and more. There’s a panel that can show other indicators, like real-time alerts, landing lights, landing gear, and more (though Turtle Beach says some of these features will be added later by software and firmware updates). This hardware doesn’t feature force feedback or rumble.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8U8944UrW87x8KiQjhaVnAKBIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657814/pov_hat_switches.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A zoomed-in look at the POV and HAT switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J58Hp7"&gt;CEO Juergen Stark said in a press release that this hardware “provides everything a new flier needs, along with the capability and features that hardcore flight simmers want.” In case you were curious, Turtle Beach says this hardware will work with other flight simulators — not just Microsoft’s latest one that’s available now on PC and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;coming later to console on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;. This hardware has a release window targeted for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach Recon controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz5RkceKzLXhDPe0_pO9Un7ChiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657785/tb_recon_controller.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dvfphu"&gt;The company is also releasing its first traditional controller for the Xbox Series X / S called the Recon Controller. It’s an intimidating-looking $60 wired model, and what makes it special is its audio chops. If you plug any set of headphones into its 3.5mm jack, you can turn on mic monitoring and swap through audio presets to modify how your game sounds. You’ll also have the option to use Turtle Beach’s Superhuman Hearing feature usually found in its own headsets, which amplifies easy-to-miss sounds that might give you the edge in a game. There are also buttons to adjust the game and chat audio mixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKcfYX"&gt;In addition, the sensitivity of the analog sticks can be tweaked and different profiles can be saved to one of the controller’s mappable quick-action buttons located on the rear. Its directional pad supports eight-way input, and its 10-foot braided cable is attached via USB-C to the controller. It’s also coming out sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After saving Tuca &amp; Bertie, Adult Swim has posted the first episode of season 2 on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym4e_UyC3fj0-yq9zOPLWMPLCqI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451428/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_12.48.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adult Swim&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gm76j9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie &lt;/em&gt;is back on the air thanks to Adult Swim, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIhZ0R2H7M"&gt;watch the entire first episode of season 2 for free&lt;/a&gt; on Adult Swim’s YouTube channel right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd86Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie&lt;/em&gt; is an animated show from &lt;em&gt;BoJack Horseman &lt;/em&gt;producer and artist Lisa Hanawalt starring Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong as two best friends navigating their adult lives. The show first premiered on Netflix in 2019 and debuted to rave reviews, but the streaming service canceled it after just one season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLomgV"&gt;In 2020, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267667/tuca-and-bertie-season-two-adult-swim-netflix-renewed-saved-bojack-horseman-lisa-hanawalt"&gt;Adult Swim picked up a 10-episode order of the show&lt;/a&gt;. The first episode of that new season premiered Sunday night, and if you missed the debut or just want to check out the show for yourself, you can catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X04lZa"&gt;If you watch this first episode and want to catch up on the series, you’ll have to subscribe to Netflix, as the first season is only available on the streaming service. New episodes air on Adult Swim on Sundays at 11:30PM ET / PT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUcFuu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is banning alcohol, gambling, and politics from its ‘most prominent’ ad slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16VGS100QPvwsHwyHyNlRgnX-Cg=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451248/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.36.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the YouTube masthead ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oaWGXa"&gt;YouTube will &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10249050"&gt;no longer be accepting ads&lt;/a&gt; relating to alcohol, gambling, politics, or “prescription drug terms” for its masthead ad slot, which appears at the top of the website and app, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-masthead-advertising-ban-9b8d3f1c-f0e4-4520-bcad-fa2e1e46b1a5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the limitations on what kind of ads can appear in this slot will help “lead to a better experience for users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1drIW"&gt;The masthead slot is one of the first things users see when they open YouTube, so it’s understandable that keeping ads about drugs, alcohol, or gambling out of it would make YouTube more inclusive for everyone. As for politics, it could help the platform avoid controversies, like the one that arose when then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/youtube-will-end-full-day-masthead-reservations-like-trump-used.html"&gt;purchased the slot for three days&lt;/a&gt; during the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8W94yqS__A90P9oIPb3wH_UVeGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658293/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_11.23.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new masthead requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RDZJbV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9709826"&gt;YouTube’s ad support page&lt;/a&gt;, ads in the masthead slot can “drive massive reach or awareness,” but now that megaphone will no longer be available to people wanting to advertise in certain spaces. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;already provides a way&lt;/a&gt; for users to limit the number of alcohol and gambling-related ads they see on YouTube, and in theory the setting would’ve applied to the masthead ad — according to Google, last year the company changed the slot to show targeted ads, rather than ones that had been reserved for an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2fQYZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/12/01/google-to-limit-some-drug-ads/070b7462-815d-47e1-9600-7af29ee871da/"&gt;For years&lt;/a&gt; Google has tried to balance its policies to determine what it does and doesn’t show in ads — recently, it’s reined in ads that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375702/google-updates-youtube-ad-targeting-hate-speech"&gt;used hate speech as keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21456323/google-election-ad-ban-donald-trump-early-victory"&gt;political misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328526/google-coronavirus-conspiracy-page-ad-ban-new-rule"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; around COVID-19. As it’s worked to clean up what ads it puts in front of users, Google’s ads business has also increasingly come under scrutiny from lawmakers who believe it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ripe for antitrust enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At $299, DJI’s leaked Mini SE might be its most affordable drone yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHbYUXc2ks17n0PqqfNgqzz5GeQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450874/dji_mini_se_upscale.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z7ffSb"&gt;We called the DJI Mini 2 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the best drone you can buy under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but what if you don’t have $449 to spend? Walmart has leaked a new entry in DJI’s Mavic Mini line that might start at just $299, which should make it the company’s most affordable drone ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBM3ZV"&gt;Not only did we just find that price &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDJI-Mini-SE%2F550297208&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s apparently migrated to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GAtamer/status/1403392256770445321"&gt;at least one set&lt;/a&gt; of Walmart store shelves already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qulh2J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/agxlPAF1Pb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/agxlPAF1Pb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Güçlü Atamer (@GAtamer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GAtamer/status/1403392256770445321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h7uihJ"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: as far as we can tell, this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; actually a less-expensive DJI Mini 2 — it appears to be a less-expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack"&gt;first-gen DJI Mavic Mini&lt;/a&gt;, a drone from 2019. As &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/06/03/dji-mini-se-shows-up-on-wal-mart-but-is-it-really-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, all the specs seem to line up with the original Mavic Mini, including its lower-res 2.7K-resolution camera (compare to 4K) and its inferior 2.5-mile wireless range, which strongly suggests the Mini SE doesn’t have Ocusync. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agXzeg"&gt;As Vjeran discusses in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our Mini 2 review&lt;/a&gt;, the Ocusync wireless link is perhaps the biggest reason to pick it over the Mavic Mini. It’s not just range: Ocusync is far more reliable and responsive, too. And though Walmart’s online images &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to suggest the DJI Mini SE might come with the Mini 2’s new-and-improved controller, the back of Walmart’s in-store reservation card makes it look like you’re still getting the original folding pad:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8iFakTe01wt8lbuYAH0Oak-Dsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658224/mini_se_back_card_reddit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/ns235y/what_the_link_in_first_comment/" target="_blank"&gt;u/Mr_DMoody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can make out a tiny image of the old folding controller at lower left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHZH2A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/ns235y/what_the_link_in_first_comment/h0mc6tp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;As internet sleuths are pointing out&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like the primary differences here are simply a $100 lower price and a slightly improved plastic chassis, which may or may not make it compatible with the Mini 2’s batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GltUl"&gt;Bargain hunters will know that $299 isn’t completely unheard of for a DJI drone — I’ve seen refurbished and closeout Phantom 3 Standard kits for $299, and I believe there was a one-time $299 deal on the Mavic Mini. But if the DJI Mini SE actually retails for $299, that’d be a deal right out of the gate. It’d be extremely tempting to would-be drone buyers looking for something they can easily stuff in a bag and (at sub-249g) one they won’t need to register with the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhVsu9"&gt;It’s not clear when the Mini SE might go on sale. DJI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything we know about Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iD1UgiaImJ8gb9ulk_fXtCx5p-I=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450387/HaloInfinite_613_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bnoYCU"&gt;343 Industries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531861/halo-infinite-e3-2021-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;gave us a first glimpse at Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode yesterday, and now we’re getting even more information on how the weapons, armor, and sandbox experience will work. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is launching on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC later this year, allowing friends to play the free multiplayer mode across multiple platforms using crossplay and cross-progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VTOIE"&gt;The free multiplayer mode will also include a battle pass that never expires after you’ve purchased it. We don’t know how much the battle pass will cost yet, but &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;players will be able to purchase old season passes and choose which battle pass to focus progression toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXAAVP"&gt;343 Industries is leaning heavily into armor, weapon, and vehicle customizations, without random loot or loot boxes. The battle pass will provide armor and presumably more, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; players will also be able to play to earn customizations that even include customizing a character’s voice or adding prosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gc2DyfEH7q65-PnWN5EQEtjHAiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657838/yN0PNvJ.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armor customizations in Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="80Ozhi"&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YNg1vk"&gt;“There will be millions of customization combinations for Spartans on the battlefield,” explains Ryan Paradis, a live design director at 343 Industries. Armor customizations will include different coatings, emblems, effects, and all the typical armor pieces like your shoulders, gloves, kneepads, helmet, and visor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVE7E0"&gt;Weapons will also include a variety of customizations, and even vehicles will get customization options, too. Players will be able to customize each item in-game or through the Halo Waypoint website and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBb8t"&gt;A lot of customizations are unlocked through playing the game, and only through playing. All of the customizations are purely cosmetic, and each season will introduce new looks that players can collect. 343 Industries hasn’t revealed whether different sets of armor will have different sets of power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0vW4xBEfm9HT4RXp2xmuKHnvFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657860/grapplehook.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s grappling hook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hQBidm"&gt;Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kKuCsY"&gt;Classic &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;weapons are returning, including an assault rifle, battle rifle, gravity hammer, needler, plasma pistol, and even sticky plasma grenades. There will be a variety of heavy weapons, with one demonstrated in the trailer that can take out vehicles. Dual-wielding won’t be supported at launch, but 343 Industries &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/halo-infinite-wont-have-dual-wielding-at-launch/"&gt;isn’t ruling it out entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJBIcX"&gt;343 Industries revealed how combat works in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Equipment is returning with &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and you can use the new grappling hook for tactical play and combine it with other equipment to complete objectives. The grappling hook can also be used for mobility to move quickly around a map or to grab weapons and throwable objects. Other players can also pick up items like your overshield during play, and even choose when to use them instead of instant activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y3JRdu"&gt;Vehicles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Mvwi"&gt;Vehicles are a big part of the battle arena in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. A new Razorback vehicle can carry additional weapons at the rear, and it’s designed to be a cousin of the classic Warthog. The Warthog will be available in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s part of a number of vehicles that will be delivered by Pelicans instead of spawning at bases. Weapon pods, like the &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt; days, will also drop during combat for resupplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIKS6a"&gt;Using a vehicle will come at a risk, though. A Warthog’s wheels can be blown off from damage, and vehicles catch fire after a certain damage threshold. That means you have to choose when to ditch a vehicle wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puxfN6YOW6243iWtMWLW0AYRqYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657855/vehicleshaloinfinite.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vehicles in Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RVnyLT"&gt;Academy and training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QjwFua"&gt;If you’re new to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, there’s even an academy mode to let people get used to the look, feel, and terminology of the game. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is using bots in a separate training and tutorial area, with a variety of difficulty levels so they can also be used as training partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkVxDr"&gt;This area is a separate map to the environments we’ve seen in the trailers. It’s not clear how many maps will be available in Halo Infinite yet, but we’ve seen both outdoor and indoor maps that offer the variety of close combat or distance and vehicle usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxB6Z"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is launching simultaneously on PC and Xbox, crossplay and cross-progression will be included at launch. On Xbox Series X, the arena mode will support up to 120fps, and on the PC side there will be support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1e6Vj"&gt;343 Industries hasn’t provided a deep dive on how it plans to balance crossplay controller vs. mouse and keyboard, but there will be input-based matchmaking for the ranked parts of the game. The studio has also &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-april-2021"&gt;committed to a server-side anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt;, which includes spotting hackers based on their behavior in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxTBgh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launches in the fall on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC. A “technical preview” will be available later this summer, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/halo-insider"&gt;sign up at the Halo Waypoint site&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to get access.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reality Winner has been released from prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Press conference of Reality Leigh Winner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqI02tkFUfHrtqPvSsNNlhkCzEc=/0x283:4611x3357/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450327/694744988.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHXrra"&gt;Reality Winner, a former intelligence contractor jailed for leaking classified information, has been released from prison to serve her remaining sentence in a halfway house program. Winner’s attorney Alison Grinter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alisongrinter/status/1404457754962636804"&gt;tweeted the news&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ website lists Winner in custody of San Antonio’s Residential Reentry Management field office, which oversees community-based programs for incarcerated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KPSRQ"&gt;“I am thrilled to announce that Reality Winner has been released from prison. She is still in custody in the residential reentry process, but we are relieved and hopeful,” Grinter tweeted in a statement. “Reality and her family have asked for privacy during the transition process as they work to heal the trauma of incarceration and build back the years lost. Her release is not a product of the pardon or compassionate release process, but rather the time earned from exemplary behavior while incarcerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdfpge"&gt;Grinter said Winner is still barred from public statements or appearances, and the BOP’s website still lists her release date as November 23rd, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SSvotD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some very exciting news for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RealityWinner?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RealityWinner&lt;/a&gt; and her family!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/yjZf7xiitk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yjZf7xiitk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alison Grinter Allen (@alisongrinter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alisongrinter/status/1404457754962636804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jrvibF"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Grinter wrote that Winner would continue to seek a pardon. “The Residential Reentry center is in charge right now and will manage her transition, but we are definitely still seeking commutation and pardon,” she said. “The fight continues and I’ll still be taking meetings in Washington to press forward the case for commutation and pardon, but the family will be stepping back to concentrate on Reality and her health and healing. She became an aunt while she was behind bars, and she is going to spend as much time as she can bonding and tickling little feet as she adjusts to life in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VP2v7c"&gt;Winner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17503656/reality-winner-guilty-plea-agreement-prison-time"&gt;pleaded guilty to espionage&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, one year &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-contractor-georgia-charged-removing-and-mailing-classified-materials-news"&gt;after being arrested&lt;/a&gt; for leaking a National Security Agency report on US election security. The report &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/"&gt;detailed Russian attempts&lt;/a&gt; to hack US voting systems before the 2016 election, an issue then-President Donald Trump had downplayed in the following months. (It did not indicate whether the cyberattack had any concrete effect on the election.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMonjW"&gt;Federal law enforcement determined that Winner had printed the report and mailed it to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and her plea deal included a five-year prison sentence under the Espionage Act — a law that’s difficult to mount a defense against, since defendants effectively can’t argue that they disclosed information in the public interest. Both the Trump and Obama administrations have leveraged the Espionage Act against whistleblowers, including Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison before &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/17/528731790/after-serving-7-years-of-a-35-year-sentence-chelsea-manning-to-walk-free"&gt;having her sentence commuted&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys39rc"&gt;Winner unsuccessfully sought a release from prison during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, and she tested positive for COVID-19 in July 2020. A &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/united-states-vs-reality-winner-review-1234932409/"&gt;documentary about her case&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;United States vs. Reality Winner&lt;/em&gt;, premiered at the SXSW film festival this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus launches $499.99 Chromebook Flip CM5 with AMD Ryzen 5 processors </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXCU8DiBe2p8JNXPZrhuPwXfRSs=/0x71:813x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450240/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHNaXA"&gt;Asus has released its latest Ryzen-powered Chromebook, the Chromebook Flip CM5. The CM5 has a 15.6-inch screen, and Asus is pushing it as a device for cloud-based gaming. It’s available now at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abt.com%2FAsus-Chromebook-Mineral-Gray-15.6-AMD-xA0-Ryzen-xA0-3-xA0-3250U-xA0-Processor-4GB-RAM-64GB-eMMC-AMD-Radeon-Graphics-CM5500FDADS344T%2Fp%2F162596.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22533361%2Fasus-chromebook-flip-cm5-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeAsusChromebookFlipCM5061421&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-cm5500fda-ds344t%2Fp%2FN82E16834235776" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt; starting at $499.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNFG9B"&gt;The most exciting thing is that the CM5 supports both Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now. Of course, it only has a 60Hz screen and Radeon integrated graphics, so it’s far from a “gaming laptop” of any sort. Still, Asus has made a few design tweaks to better evoke the aesthetic. Namely, the WASD keys are outlined in orange, which Asus says “lets users stand out while enjoying quick, intuitive gameplay in cloud-based games.” Some Windows laptops have done bold things with their WASD keys, but this is the first Chromebook we’ve seen with that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBhpnP"&gt;Asus also emphasized the Harmon Kardon-certified audio system and Wi-Fi stabilizer technology, which should likely help create a more immersive gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzdDM1tmb6oEGmtD37ghuqGWCyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657876/34_235_776_V22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Newegg&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="czLXPg"&gt;The CM5 has a 57Wh battery, which Asus claims offers up to 10 hours of battery life. You can configure the device with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as well. You can choose a Ryzen 5 3500C or a Ryzen 3 3250C, both of which come with AMD Radeon integrated graphics. The chassis itself is made of an aluminum alloy, which Asus describes as “mineral gray” with an “obsidian velvet” texture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcXrOD"&gt;I’ll keep you posted on how this device performs once I’ve gotten my hands on a unit. In the meantime, I recently reviewed its sibling, the Chromebook Detachable CM3, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell XPS 13 OLED review: more pixels, more money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED open on a table. The screen displays a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsiB3M7WzHEs8SHxacpdDnxP8uc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449719/mchin_20190905_4631_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Dell XPS 13 OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CN1B9P"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a 13-inch laptop with the best display technology out there, Dell now has an option for you. Dell has finally released an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDellXPS13OLEDReview061121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto235h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OLED version of its XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m typing this review on it right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7d1kN"&gt;The test unit I was sent has a Core i7-1185G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. The OLED configuration costs exactly the same as an identically specced non-OLED 4K model ($1,699.99), and $300 more than an identically specced FHD touchscreen model. Nothing else about this XPS is new: it has the same thin and light build, the same tiny bezels and webcam, the same glass-fiber palm rests, and the same 16:10 aspect ratio as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;past couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13s&lt;/a&gt; I’ve reviewed. So the considerations here really come down to how much you need an OLED screen and what you’re willing to sacrifice for it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="m94km9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dell XPS 13 (late-2020) review: greatness, refined","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"},{"title":"Best laptop 2021: 15 best laptops you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4OcF4ImdiKj6q7kChY6-3Kif2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653795/mchin_20190905_4631_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks just like the previous XPS 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RVuPNN"&gt;The display itself is great. It’s a 3.5K (3456 x 2160) panel with a claimed 100,000:1 contrast ratio. It maxed out our colorimeter, covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It’s not as bright as the FHD model but is still plenty bright, maxing out at 369 nits. I had no problem using the device outside and was usually using it below 30 percent brightness while indoors. Numbers aside, it delivers a really gorgeous picture with bright and vibrant colors and sharp details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I03TfK"&gt;The downside, of course, is that there is some battery life impact. I haven’t reviewed the 4K Dell XPS 13, so I can’t speak to that unit’s longevity. But compared to the FHD model I reviewed, the OLED model struggles on the battery life front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED closed seen from the left side on a wooden table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NU9n_cQXEdnfVi_xRWOvCtjGnHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653796/mchin_20190905_4631_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not too many ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="imSQve"&gt;Battery life, for context, has been a huge selling point of other XPS 13 models. I averaged nine hours and 15 minutes using the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDellXPS13OLEDReview061121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-touch-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto230h%3Fconfigurationid%3D7d01f270-b71e-4488-a6e9-56ab3a967927" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FHD model&lt;/a&gt; as my primary work driver around 200 nits of brightness. With the OLED model, I was getting about five hours from the same workload at the same brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vJCWF"&gt;That’s... well, that’s a big gap. And it should be a serious consideration if you’re thinking of purchasing this device. After all, the FHD display is still pretty darn good. The blacks on my review unit weren’t as deep as they were on this OLED panel, but the picture it delivered was still fantastic and not something my un-artistic eyes had any problems with. (On the other hand, the non-OLED 4K display also doesn’t seem to have great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2020"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-model-9310-4k"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-XPS-13-9300-4K-UHD-Laptop-Review-16-10-is-the-New-16-9.464337.0.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. So the OLED is more competitive with that model, especially since it’s the same price.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Intel Evo sticker on the bottom right corner of the Dell XPS 13 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pV_lRH5nBqf-s_oJRzfriPIvb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653797/mchin_20190905_4631_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Evo-certified, despite the battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cXIOBO"&gt;For that reason, I would still recommend that most people go for the FHD XPS 13 over the OLED model. Five hours is not great battery life, but it’s especially not great for an ultraportable laptop this close to the $2,000 mark. It’s certainly a dealbreaker for me, even if everything else about a laptop is perfect. It means I’d have to have this thing plugged in multiple times a day, even though one of its primary benefits is supposed to be that it’s light enough to carry around wherever. I want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpazZ4"&gt;Meanwhile, as nice as the OLED screen is, I can’t imagine it’ll make a huge quality-of-life difference to all but the most discerning of viewers. It certainly shouldn’t be a big enough difference to outweigh a $300 premium and a four-hour hit to battery life. If you’re someone for whom the OLED is worth the price, you probably know who you are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED lid on a wooden table seen from the top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dURjdBErq8wET1b1gVuT4iDFsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653798/mchin_20190905_4631_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy it for $1,699.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="NPjFM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606062"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mu6IjI"&gt;Beats today announced its second pair of true wireless earbuds, the new Beats Studio Buds.  Priced at $149.99 and available in red, black, or white, the Studio Buds have a much different, more compact design than the previous Powerbeats Pro. There are no ear hooks on these, nor any stems, and that results in a very lightweight, comfortable fit. Preorders start today in the US and Canada from Apple and other retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earphones-beats-red%2F4900921.p%3FskuId%3D4900921&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and the earbuds will be available in stores on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7Lt2e"&gt;The Studio Buds include active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and can last for up to five hours on a charge. (If you leave noise cancellation off, they can eke out eight hours of continuous playback. They also use USB-C for charging — there’s no wireless charging, unfortunately — and either earbud can be used independently.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds have a sleek, lightweight design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8qH2S"&gt;Interestingly, Beats is supporting both iOS and Android features with the Studio Buds. On iPhone, you get the familiar, easy AirPods-like setup and Control Center integration. They can also do hands-free “Hey Siri” commands. On Android, Beats now works with Fast Pair and Google’s Find My Device features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HlBrz"&gt;Beats came up with an all-new acoustic architecture design for the Studio Buds, which have  8.2-millimeter drivers, and the company claims you can expect “outstanding stereo separation and low harmonic distortion across the frequency curve so you hear every note.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loR4Kw"&gt;If you’re wondering how the Studio Buds might stack up to the AirPods Pro or other competitors, I’ve been spending some time testing the just-announced earbuds, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22297011"&gt;read my full review of the Beats Studio Buds here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beats Studio Buds review: big ambition, imperfect execution</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Beats tried to do a lot at once — probably too much — with its new earbuds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YY8TLa"&gt;The new Studio Buds are Beats’ second pair of true wireless earbuds and follow the Powerbeats Pro, which remain my pick for the best all-around earbuds for fitness purposes like running or hitting the gym. With its latest pair, Beats is hoping to attract a much wider audience. That starts with the price, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $149.99&lt;/a&gt; — a full $100 less than the AirPods Pro. For the first time in Beats earbuds, they include active noise cancellation. And with other new features, Beats is extending an olive branch to Android users, which might come as a surprise for a brand that’s owned by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSlAkF"&gt;Beats says it has put an incredible amount of work into how the Studio Buds sound. That’s where they’re supposed to exceed expectations for the price. But you don’t get everything under the sun for $150; the most obvious missing piece is wireless charging. And their noise cancellation and transparency modes don’t keep pace with some pricier earbuds, including the AirPods Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="170UiG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10605844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YCRpFH"&gt;The Studio Buds have a small, light stem-less design that loses the ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro. They look downright miniature in comparison. And the weight difference is also substantial: each of the Studio Buds is 5.1 grams, which is far more comfortable on your ears than the 20-gram Powerbeats Pro. They’re also slightly lighter than the AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro, Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro, Jabra’s Elite 85t/75t, and many others on the market. There’s a tiny micro-venting hole meant to reduce that clogged-up pressure feeling in your ear, and Beats includes the standard three sizes of silicone ear tips. Fit is a big plus; the Studio Buds feel extremely comfortable and never fatigued my ears at any point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pxu9b74Hlrtv0mppsw60BH15a4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657483/DSCF4186_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Studio Buds are much smaller than the previous Powerbeats Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BRCiyN"&gt;Beats leaned on learnings from its prior earbuds (and those from Apple) as it worked on this design; it also went through some prototyping with consumers to land on the final form factor. The outward-facing side is contoured around a diagonal pill-shaped “b” button. It’s tactile and actually presses in instead of relying on capacitive touch sensors. I greatly prefer this approach since you won’t have to deal with accidental presses as often when adjusting the earbuds. The button only requires a light press, so you’re not constantly jamming the buds deeper into your ears. Controls work identically on both sides: press once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, three to go back, and long-press to toggle between ANC on / transparency / off. You can customize the long-press to activate a voice assistant instead, but that’s as far as Beats lets you switch things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gma9wU"&gt;The oval charging case is mercifully way smaller than the giant one that holds the Powerbeats Pro, and the red color of my review unit is quite eye-catching. There’s also something reassuring about how strongly the Studio Buds are magnetically pulled into their slots. I’m hopeful these will avoid the occasional only-one-earbud-actually-charged failures of the Powerbeats Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGvBfVOHAlKqpDIQbDEl_g4wlUk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657689/DSCF4150_Edited_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging case is also much more pocketable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MnIpuA"&gt;I’d say the most curious thing about the Studio Buds hardware is what’s been left out: there’s no Apple-made chip inside these. The Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats, and even the $50 Beats Flex neckband earbuds all have one of Apple’s branded chips inside — either the H1 or W1 — for features like instant setup, automatic pairing across all Apple devices that are signed in to your iCloud account, and audio sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GV5m4y"&gt;Despite the lack of Apple silicon, Beats has managed to replicate some of those conveniences through software. The Studio Buds support hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands. When you pop open the case near an iPhone for the first time, you’ll see the familiar setup screen (or at least something close) slide up from the bottom, just like with AirPods or other Beats products. The Studio Buds even have special integration in Control Center: you can switch between noise-canceling and transparency modes from here just as you can with the AirPods Pro. They’ll also automatically play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple Music’s new Dolby Atmos spatial audio tracks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zc0YdryhvbS2pdaO2u1oOJp3-DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657522/beatsios.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite having no Apple chip inside, the Studio Buds replicate some AirPods features through software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6SJFtd"&gt;But the illusion only stretches so far. If you go looking for them, you’ll notice MIA features that would’ve been present if the Studio Buds contained a proper Apple chip. Pairing them with your iPhone does&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;sync them across your other iCloud devices. Audio sharing is nowhere to be found. And the Studio Buds lack the ability to automatically hop between an iPhone, iPad, and Mac based on whichever one you’re actively using. (They don’t have multipoint either, so losing those seamless handoffs is all the more apparent.) These are minor sacrifices, but they do put the Studio Buds behind Apple’s headphones or even other Beats models in terms of supporting Apple’s ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQGZobYriTob3jes0osz-_O1RaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657477/DSCF4104_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a tactile “b” button on each earbud for controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J_1tGg-5HbFirbYaxZHFLpsu19E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657476/DSCF4102_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case has enough juice for two extra top-offs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOp5tN"&gt;My hunch is that Beats likely had to leave out Apple silicon in order to include Android-specific features. The Studio Buds go farther than any of the company’s recent products in accommodating Android listeners. First of all, they charge via USB-C. They also support Fast Pair, so they’ll automatically be linked to your Google account after initial setup. Both the earbuds and case now natively appear in Android’s Bluetooth settings, where you can see their battery status or see the location where they were last paired to your phone. (This means the earbuds support both Apple’s Find My network and Google’s equivalent.) But you don’t get hands-free Google Assistant, which was probably a bridge too far for an Apple-owned company to make happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPqk0BPZKcrl6ez-IRTBqyo1LhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657533/android.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beats now supports native Android features like Fast Pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aVfFdp"&gt;Now onto the sound. The Beats Studio Buds feature a new driver architecture, so while the company aimed for its signature “powerful” sound, there’s a noticeable difference when you compare these to the Powerbeats Pro. Each has its own strengths. If you care most about driving bass to keep you motivated during exercise, the older earbuds still edge these out. The Powerbeats Pro sound still comes through as punchier to me. But the Studio Buds are better balanced with increased clarity and separation across the frequency range. Whereas the Powerbeats Pro tend to deemphasize the mids, they’re not as lost in the shuffle here. The EQ has improved refinement, though it’s still the usual curve that lifts the bass and treble, and highs can sometimes give off more sibilance than I’d prefer. Overall, the Studio Buds sound plenty good, but for all of the talk about proprietary acoustic diaphragms and custom-built drivers, Beats isn’t flipping the script on what to expect for this amount of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLQeRO"&gt;And it needs to do better elsewhere. Passive noise isolation on the Studio Buds still leaves something to be desired. Even with a good seal, you’re not going to feel especially blocked off from the outside world. And unfortunately, Beats’ noise cancellation system is one of the weaker showings you’ll find in this price range. Beats says it dynamically adapts the strength of noise cancellation based on ambient noise, but I was underwhelmed in most scenarios where I tested it. The Studio Buds do a poor job at eliminating basic traffic street noise, which makes me wary of how they’d manage on a plane. The transparency mode also lacks the natural feeling of the AirPods Pro and other premium buds like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. You don’t have to spend a hundred dollars more to get better results: to my ears, Amazon’s second-generation Echo Buds surpass the Studio Buds in both noise cancellation and transparency mode for less money than the Beats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="fEy0XW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10605857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPNF3r"&gt;Battery life is rated at around five hours with noise cancellation active or eight without, and the case can provide two additional top-offs. The Studio Buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, making them workout-ready and splash-proof. And you can use either earbud independently if you want to keep one of your ears free. Voice call performance was pretty rough outdoors in busy environments, and callers found it difficult to make out my voice from the background noise. Things improved some indoors, but mic performance is another area where the Studio Buds lag competitors and their compact design might be working against them. Another annoyance is that these buds don’t have any kind of sensors to detect when they’ve been removed from your ears, so music won’t pause automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5DdrjvwzwPRaBjnLjoAVMhbH3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657478/DSCF4120_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds can last for five hours with noise cancellation on or eight with it off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gqVMt8RSea7mFrg2fCoodvCL-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657482/DSCF4162_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re also rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NPAK9f"&gt;There are aspects of the Beats Studio Buds that I really like. They’re remarkably comfortable and have simple, easy controls. It’s good that the company is shifting to a more even-handed strategy that appeals to both iPhone and Android users. And the sound is enjoyable and detailed, if not earth-shattering for $150. But they settle for mediocre active noise cancellation, lack wireless charging, and come with an incomplete grab bag of Apple ecosystem bells and whistles. It feels like Beats tried to do a little too much all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t3XExT"&gt;If you already have the Powerbeats Pro and are happy with them, there’s not much about the Studio Buds that warrants an upgrade. Like a lot of rivals battling it out at this price, they’re perfectly adequate, but they lack any one must-have standout thing. Considering the cultural clout that the Beats brand still possesses, that still might be enough for them to be a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
