    <title>Lime is bringing its electric mopeds to New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGpjZzfBwTiuUGy9PIZpl7XodpI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204498/Moped_DC__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sja2Mg"&gt;Lime’s bright green electric mopeds are coming to New York City. The company that’s better known for its electric kick scooters will initially roll out 100 mopeds in Queens, Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ5KB6"&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;first launching them in Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;.  (The company is also operating a fleet in Paris.) Lime was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383976/nyc-scooter-permit-selection-lime-bird-veoride"&gt;recently approved to deploy 1,000 electric scooters in the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; as part of New York City’s inaugural shared scooter pilot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0GNR8D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the second US market for Lime’s mopeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3RiEN"&gt;The mopeds are manufactured by NIU, a Chinese company that also supplies mopeds to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;New York City-based mobility company Revel&lt;/a&gt;. NIU’s mopeds typically get between 25–100 miles of range. Lime’s mopeds will be speed limited to 28 mph and can be controlled and monitored via wireless connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVa7EZ"&gt;The mopeds are intended to lend credibility to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;Lime’s claims of being more than just another scooter company&lt;/a&gt;. The company sees itself as a “platform” for different types of low-speed, electric-powered mobility. Last year, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tikmd"&gt;Mopeds are arguably a faster way to get around, but they can also be more dangerous, especially for novice riders. Lime says that riders will be required to take a multi-chapter rider safety course that is provided through the app, developed in partnership with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. Customers will be required to have a driver’s license in order to ride. And they’ll also have to take a selfie of themselves wearing one of the provided helmets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChO5Wf"&gt;The news comes a day after Revel, New York’s other moped operator, announced that it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405539/revel-ride-share-nyc-tesla-model-y-moped-uber"&gt;offering a Tesla-only ride-hailing service in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $249 now at Best Buy and Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The blood oxygen animation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dqFRVtWs7Wj7FD9DSYpZHaRqxcU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204449/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UXw07U"&gt;Best Buy and Amazon are offering the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) for $249, smashing yesterday’s discounted price of $299. This model normally sold for $399, and today’s price drop makes it more affordable than — and superior to — the Apple Watch SE that costs $279. The one downside to this promo is that it only loops in the Product Red model that’s all red, which might not go with your look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RDawh"&gt;At this price, it’s currently about $80 more than 38mm-sized Apple Watch Series 3, yet it provides a sizable boost in power and capabilities. For one, the Series 6 has more internal storage. A few other perks of this discounted watch include its always-on display that’s surprisingly efficient, and its ability to take blood oxygen readings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;You can see all of the differences here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNKVDl"&gt;This deal is lasting until later today, April 29th. Best Buy in particular usually has a lot of stock when it puts something on sale, but place your order quickly at either retailer if you’re interested in case there’s a swell of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rm1PYD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MVmcSY"&gt;Other deals you should know about today include Woot’s one-day sale on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds. These keep dropping in price, and this deal is the best yet. If you use the Woot mobile app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/woot/id571457538?itsct=apps_box_link&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woot.android.main&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) to buy them and have Amazon Prime, you’ll get 10 percent off the order. So, instead of paying $170 (which matches the lowest price we’d seen up to this point), you’ll pay just $153 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sV9OOv"&gt;If you don’t want to jump through those hoops, here’s the link to its site where you can get them for $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J4tBBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Meg0Kz"&gt;Daily Steals is offering an extra discount on standalone Google Wifi routers that can be &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9548099?hl=en"&gt;added onto either Google Wifi or Nest Wifi mesh Wi-Fi systems&lt;/a&gt;. With the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEWIFI&lt;/strong&gt;, you can get a new one for $68. The price over at Amazon fluctuates between $70 and $80. This purchase seems ideal if you want to add more coverage to eliminate Wi-Fi dropouts in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m9n1vW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Hiaw"&gt;Lastly, Daily Steals has yet another good deal if you want a new wireless gaming headset and don’t mind buying one that released a few years ago. Logitech’s G533 with DTS 7.1 virtual surround sound is just $55 by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELGTCH&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/4/14116582/logitech-g533-wireless-gaming-headset-pc-price-ces-2017"&gt;Former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Vlad Savov spoke highly of its sound quality in 2017&lt;/a&gt; when they used to cost $150. These are rated to last up to 15 hours per charge and the battery is replaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OR4BBH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="QQxhRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s library redesign makes it easier to find your downloaded content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYoONOZW_IqtNL3Xy0BjTMCHLqs=/0x0:8000x5333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204385/spotify.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify’s redesigned Your Library features dynamic tabs and an easier way to sort your downloaded content. | Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ri8Wis"&gt;Spotify is trying again to make its Your Library tab easier to navigate. It’s &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-29/listeners-can-explore-their-spotify-collections-faster-and-easier-with-a-new-your-library"&gt;introducing&lt;/a&gt; dynamic filters, a new grid view, the ability to pin content, and different sorting options. The changes are coming to all users across iOS and Android over the coming week. The filters will likely be the most useful change, with users being able to filter between album, artist, playlist, or podcast. Premium users can also choose to view only downloaded content, which, up until now, has been hard to find within Spotify without scrolling through every artist and album they’ve saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14lZA"&gt;Users can also choose to pin four playlists, albums, or podcast shows that’ll show up at the top of their content. To pin, swipe right on what you want to keep at the top. Finally, users can view content in a grid view or in a list by the content’s alphabetical order, recently played, or the creators’ names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrXRE1"&gt;The changes aren’t exactly monumental, but that downloaded content filter will likely be especially useful. I know I’ve spent way too long trying to find something I’ve saved whenever I fly, so hopefully this solves that issue. Spotify last updated Your Library &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-06-13/spotifys-your-library-refresh-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but only for Premium users. This forthcoming update will make the experience easier for everyone, which is much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft shakes up PC gaming by reducing Windows store cut to just 12 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJHMC2LiwaIdhtYqrumVnd9STdE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204323/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhzx1p"&gt;Microsoft is shaking up the world of PC gaming today with a big cut to the amount of revenue it takes from games on Windows. The software giant is reducing its cut from 30 percent to just 12 percent from August 1st, in a clear bid to compete with Steam and entice developers and studios to bring more PC games to its Microsoft Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ntGFw"&gt;“Game developers are at the heart of bringing great games to our players, and we want them to find success on our platforms,” says Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios at Microsoft. “A clear, no-strings-attached revenue share means developers can bring more games to more players and find greater commercial success from doing so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkPAYp"&gt;These changes will only affect PC games and not Xbox console games in Microsoft’s store. While Microsoft hasn’t explained why it’s not reducing the 30 percent it takes on Xbox game sales, it’s likely because the console business model is entirely different to PC. Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo subsidize hardware to make consoles more affordable, and offer marketing deals in return for a 30 percent cut on software sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gY3UFk"&gt;Microsoft’s new reduction on the PC side is significant, and it matches the same revenue split that Epic Games offers PC game developers while also putting more pressure on Valve to reduce its Steam store cut. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18120577/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition"&gt;Valve still takes a 30 percent cut on sales&lt;/a&gt; in its Steam store, which is reduced to 25 percent when sales hit $10 million, and then 20 percent for every sale after $50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfON0iQZ2qBHzL-0kALhqJkq4-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477692/social_og.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam is still the dominate games store on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="551rFJ"&gt;Despite this larger revenue cut, Steam continues to dominate mind and market share among developers, but many don’t think the 30 percent fee is fair. A &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210428005374/en/Game-Developers-Conference%E2%80%99s-2021-State-of-the-Industry-Survey-Shows-Pandemic-Brought-Delays---But-Also-Growth-Reflects-Rising-Interest-in-the-PlayStation-5-and-Strong-Disapproval-of-30-Digital-Storefront-Revenue-Shares"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of 3,000 game industry professionals found that most game devs don’t think Steam earns its 30 percent revenue cut. Microsoft’s move will only increase the pressure on Valve further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MIp2U"&gt;Competing with Steam is still a big challenge. Microsoft and Epic Games have both struggled to convince game developers to list titles in their stores to compete with Steam. Epic Games has tried exclusives to lure developers in, but a big part of Microsoft’s struggles have been related to forcing game developers to use UWP in the past, and the terrible Windows store app that exists today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BzFsTw"&gt;Microsoft finally started supporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645250/microsoft-xbox-game-studios-publishing-valve-steam-32-bit-windows"&gt;traditional win32 games in its store a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but this change alone hasn’t helped the Windows store compete with Steam. The 12 percent cut might tempt more developers into listing their games in Microsoft’s store, particularly if the company can improve the poor experience for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxMVLEeNGXQBtO2FuEh9C3xAt0c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477694/096WaLI.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is promising Windows store improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HIcA5y"&gt;Booty is promising just that, with “improved install reliability and faster download speeds over the next few months.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;Microsoft is also reportedly working on an overhaul to its Windows store&lt;/a&gt; that could pave the way for developers to be able to submit any Windows application to the store — including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. These store improvements may even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps, which would be a big shift alongside this 12 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpCc9L"&gt;Beyond the store, Microsoft still needs to significantly improve PC gaming. The Xbox Game Bar has been a welcome improvement, but services like Steam and Discord are far more popular than Microsoft’s alternatives. The world’s biggest PC games are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem"&gt;fighting a huge surge in cheaters and hackers&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows doesn’t do enough to help game studios protect their games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbKys4"&gt;“We know that we still have a lot of work to do, but based on the response from both PC gamers and PC game developers, we think that we’re headed in the right direction for this community with the investments we’re making,” says Booty. Microsoft still has more to share on its PC plans and general Windows improvements in the coming months. Booty teases a promising second half of 2021 “when our work across the entire PC ecosystem has the potential to come together in a way that propels the industry forward and brings great games to more gamers around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite will support crossplay and cross-progression on Xbox and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cj2QdmolOxTy2Y4u8-4Kj4JABHs=/9x0:1805x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204336/haloinfinite.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5NFrt"&gt;Microsoft is announcing today that &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e will support crossplay and cross-progression when it launches later this year. This will allow PC and Xbox players to match together and play the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign, and the support also extends to multiplayer. Any multiplayer customization and progress will sync across both PC and Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVJvT1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;will also be free to play&lt;/a&gt; when it launches later this year, with support for up to 120fps in the arena mode on Xbox Series X. Microsoft is also ensuring all of the customizations PC players expect are available inside &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite. &lt;/em&gt;This includes support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A21SnY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Halo Infinite: watch 8 minutes of gameplay on Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"},{"title":"Microsoft confirms Halo Infinite multiplayer will be free-to-play and up to 120fps ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"},{"title":"Halo Infinite is looking a lot better in these 4K screenshots ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S5hkAV"&gt;We’re now waiting to hear more about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; and when the beta will be available across PC and Xbox ahead of the game’s debut this fall. Developer 343 Industries is still working on improving the visuals in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;game was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following criticisms over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;gameplay demo last summer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; certainly looks a lot better in recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302094/halo-infinite-4k-screenshots-pc"&gt;4K PC screenshots released by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, but we haven’t seen any updated gameplay in almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nZVPJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e is a “spiritual reboot” of the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;making it easy for new players to immediately jump into the story. It includes an open-world environment that’s very similar to &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with the original Warthog vehicle and the Banished enemies. 343 Industries has also added new mechanics like Master Chief’s new grappling hook and a “Drop Wall” cover.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LZ-EGmE6YSNq_MtkdoB5kTavNR0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204223/cwelch_20210428_4565_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLVDcf"&gt;Roku has a strange relationship with remotes: it’s one of the worst offenders when it comes to branded buttons, with a seemingly ever-rotating list of streaming services — Netflix, Sling, even Rdio at one point — that have come and gone over time. One of its remotes even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21436977/roku-touch-remote-button-useless-design-purpose-feature-software-update"&gt;bears a mysterious glyph&lt;/a&gt; that’s never been used for anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt4Fcb"&gt;And yet, Roku also leads the pack when it comes to customizability. For the last couple years, some of its remotes have offered programmable buttons, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;its recently released Voice Remote Pro&lt;/a&gt; elevates them to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnjLrEIQgdcpFMo2hq6msgItqto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476645/cwelch_20210428_4565_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QxUk3b"&gt;The programmable shortcut keys, labeled with just a 1 and a 2, are almost infinitely customizable. And Roku actually has the software support to back them up in an easy and approachable way, one that the updated Voice Remote Pro’s mic makes even easier with its hands-free commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hBQyB"&gt;Speak any voice command — be it as basic as opening a streaming app that Roku doesn’t have a sponsored button for, or as complex as “lower the volume to 10 percent” — and then press and hold the button afterward, and you instantly create a shortcut to do that action on command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wACWOQ"&gt;As my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;Chris Welch explains&lt;/a&gt; in his review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ksWUKp"&gt;The buttons labeled “1” and “2” can save any voice command that Roku supports; just long-press either button after the voice command, and it’ll be set as that button’s function. This can be as simple as using them as two shortcuts for apps that don’t have their own button, like “open HBO Max” or “open Peacock.” But you can also use the shortcut buttons for searches (“show me free movies”), input selection (“switch to antenna TV”), or TV controls (“turn the volume up,” “turn on closed captioning”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cVLRz4"&gt;It’s a clever system, one that leverages Roku’s voice controls to allow for complex commands, without requiring that users muck around with complicated software menus to program in exactly what they want. You just say what you want your Roku to do, and then save it for as long (or as little) as you need. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHcZdyF6mIoEJGsHE9xc-m-nk4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476647/cwelch_20210428_4565_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O86dgq"&gt;Roku’s customization system is also easily reprogrammable on the fly: want a dedicated button that just plays &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 2&lt;/em&gt;? You can have it. Trying to learn French by watching Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Lupin&lt;/em&gt;? You can quickly make a button to toggle captions. The only real limit is your imagination (and Roku’s &lt;a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694"&gt;surprisingly deep bench of voice command options&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Z6Hkm"&gt;Roku’s system also helps to alleviate one of the biggest issues with voice assistants — sometimes, you don’t want to bother your housemates with the noise of you constantly asking your TV to change channels. Once programmed, the shortcut buttons make it possible to use complex or long voice commands silently, making them the perfect complement to Roku remotes’ similarly roommate-pacifying headphone feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRZKRV"&gt;It’s a system that’s so useful, it’s a wonder that companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google — all of which feature set-top boxes with their own robust voice assistant setups — aren’t looking to offer a similar feature in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4CmqY"&gt;Voice remotes are all well and good, but at the end of the day, no one wants to hear you shouting over the sound of the latest episode of your favorite show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Returnal is dark, challenging, and the perfect PS5 showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_QzNXMKVimGJeLegukbrN1aIdnM=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69204052/50700424253_e8d902ea3e_k.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PRQG8S"&gt;We’re nearly six months into the life of the current generation of game consoles, but there are still vanishingly few high-profile exclusives that show off what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X can do. After getting through the initial wave of launch titles, I’ve spent most of 2021 using my PS5 to play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But this week sees the launch of &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, a PS5 exclusive that comes with some caveats. It’s challenging and complex, making it the kind of game you’ll die in repeatedly. But it also might be the best showcase for Sony’s new console yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvRiUG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the spaceboots of an astronaut experiencing the worst case of deja vu imaginable. After crash landing on a mysterious alien planet, she soon realizes she’s stuck in a loop; every time she dies, she heads back to the crash site to start all over again. Each time you explore, you learn just a little bit more about the planet and the astronaut, as well as the rules of the game. With more information and practice, you’ll (hopefully) be able to progress slightly farther each loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPQ9M6"&gt;The game plays out as a third person shooter, but it’s also a mish-mash of many different inspirations and genres. Despite the perspective, &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; often feels like a bullet hell shooter, with alien creatures spitting countless energy orbs for you to avoid. You even get bonuses for avoiding getting hit. (This aspect of the game shouldn’t be too surprising, as &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; was developed by Housemarque, a studio best-known for games like &lt;em&gt;Super Stardust&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Resogun&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oz9cGY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lL2Qa0MQyuE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmqxuV"&gt;The loop structure also means that the game plays out like a roguelike (think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;games like &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Each “run” is different; the planet remixes itself each time you play, and you’ll pick up different weapons and fight different enemies along the way. There are also elements of &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, where you’ll come across roadblocks that you can’t get around until you unlock the right item or ability. Early on, for instance, there are electrified webs that block your way, and you can’t cut them down until you get a massive laser sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VoE8kY"&gt;It should also be noted that &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is extremely hard, combining two notoriously challenging genres — roguelikes and bullet hell shooters — into a game that does little to make itself accessible. In fact, there aren’t even any difficulty options, aside from the ability to turn up the aim assist. The result is an experience where you’ll have to get used to death and failure, and learn from your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JFS8I6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What stands out is its use of sound and the DualSense controller&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvvdGG"&gt;It can be frustrating, but it’s worth pushing through for a few reasons. For one, the action feels incredible; zipping around while shooting octopus birds and slicing at evil tree-creatures with a huge sword is a blast. But &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is also a game that’s just dripping with atmosphere — and it’s only enhanced by some of the PS5’s unique features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1z1JVm"&gt;The dark world you’ll explore feels ripped out of an &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; movie, complete with towering, crumbling ancient ruins, and lots of disturbing bio-engineered technology. This is all rendered in incredible detail, and &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; particularly shines when it comes to special effects; there are all kinds of hypnotically beautiful explosions of light and color, and I especially love the fast travel effect, which sees your character melt away into nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0ANd9yFrnUghuOUiVjpzZK2Inw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476658/50826660412_71c9837773_k.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="USTWoR"&gt;But there are lots of great-looking PS5 games already. Even last-gen titles look good on the new hardware. What makes &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; stand out in particular is its use of sound and the DualSense controller. I’ve spent most of my time with the game so far wearing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D headphones&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the first game where I’ve really noticed the 3D audio that the company has touted so much. I could pinpoint monsters by the sounds of their screams and growls, which was extremely helpful, as there’s often so much happening on screen that it can be hard to follow. The sound design also makes the game that much creepier; the alien monsters make unsettling noises as they approach, and it always made me wary when stepping into a new, unknown space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNBuNd"&gt;Meanwhile, I’d go so far as to say it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;the best DualSense game since &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with the console in order to show off the gamepad’s unique capabilities. The subtle vibrations mean you can feel the patter of raindrops in your palms, and the burst of each weapon has its own distinct sensation. There are also some really creepy noises that come out of the speaker (though you may miss them with headphones on). My favorite feature, though, is the way &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; utilizes the controller’s adaptive triggers. The left trigger has two phases: push halfway and you can zoom in to aim your main weapon, but click it all the way down and you’ll unleash a special attack. It basically gives the controller an extra button in a way that feels very natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yf86u7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; is definitely an acquired taste. Its looping structure and unforgiving nature means many players will end up frustrated as they struggle through nearly identical scenarios repeatedly. Death isn’t always fun. But it also blends together so many cool things, from the vibe of &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; to the thrill of a great arcade shooter, in a way that’s seamless and deliberate. And if you’re someone who actually managed to pick up a PS5, it’s the kind of game you’ll want to take out to show off what the console can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9L7Wg4"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Returnal &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on April 30th on the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Play (2021) review: a fairly good phone for a very good price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good phone for the price, but if you can spend a bit more you’ll get some worthwhile upgrades&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jijWOE"&gt;The Moto G Play is the least expensive of four phones that Motorola introduced for the US market earlier this year. Introduced at $169, it’s already enjoying an apparently permanent $10 mark down, placing it firmly in budget territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLqMWm"&gt;Most of what you’ll find on the G Play’s spec list makes a lot of sense given that price point: a 6.5-inch 720p LCD with standard refresh rate, Snapdragon 460 processor with 3GB of RAM, and a generous 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQGEiE"&gt;There’s another factor that might sway some shoppers toward the G Play, too: as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;LG leaves the budget phone space&lt;/a&gt; and its remaining stock disappears from retailers’ shelves, Motorola’s budget-friendly phone will be one of a smaller number of options. In the US. we haven’t seen the kind of sub-$150 devices from Motorola that the company has introduced in other markets this year, so for now, the G Play is a likely candidate for the budget-oriented phone shopper’s consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yq02wW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10470952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="abrA10"&gt;There are a couple of aspects of the phone’s feature set that feel underwhelming even considering the price: namely, a paltry 32GB of storage (though it can be expanded after the fact) and a 13-megapixel main camera when more advanced, high-resolution pixel-binning sensors are becoming the norm at every price point, for example. But in short, the G Play performs just fine for its price. Just know that you’ll need to bring patience and acceptance of a few shortcomings, and that spending an extra $50 to $100 if your budget allows would get you some meaningful upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Fj8ocXqWgKds7jM22tLsrhGO1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446427/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Play’s 6.5-inch display is a bit low-res for its size and hard to see in bright outdoor light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4NdOM4"&gt;Moto G Play performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TsNIGy"&gt;The G Play uses a Snapdragon 460 chipset which was introduced over a year ago and is an entry-level Qualcomm processor. Coupled with 3GB of RAM, it manages to keep up with routine tasks like jumping between apps and scrolling social media, albeit with subtle-but-noticeable stuttering along the way. Heavier tasks like starting and stopping Google Maps navigation take an extra couple of beats. It’s not as frustrating as my experience with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt; was, but it’s a step down from the kind of performance you can expect from a phone that’s $50-100 more expensive, including those in Motorola’s own G-series lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="STHUPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The G Play includes a 5,000mAh battery, which is significantly bigger than the typical 4,000 or 4,500mAh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVK5Qk"&gt;The screen, likewise, gets the job done but doesn’t particularly shine. Its 720p resolution is stretched thin across the 6.5-inch display and images are noticeably pixelated. Colors are on the cooler side and the screen is a bit dim unless you max out the brightness. Even with the brightness cranked all the way up I had a hard time seeing it outdoors. We spend so many hours looking at our devices that this is one area where it might be worth upgrading. That said, there isn’t exactly anything wrong with the display — it’s just not very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJxSkW"&gt;There’s better news on the battery front. The G Play includes a 5,000mAh battery, which is significantly bigger than the typical 4,000 or 4,500mAh found in other comparably sized Android phones. Motorola claims it will get three days of battery life, which is probably true if you’re a light user and conservative with your screen brightness. I had no problem getting two days on a charge with a couple of hours each day of screen-on time. A full day and then some of heavy use is definitely reasonable to expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eUodGD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Storage is expandable via microSD card, so plan on that extra $10-15 as a necessary part of the purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dXVVyI"&gt;The Moto G Play includes just 32GB of storage — about as low as it gets in 2021. Considering roughly half of that will be taken up with operating system files, it’s just not enough. Storage is expandable via microSD card, so plan on that extra $10-15 as a necessary part of the purchase if you don’t already have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBBRcS"&gt;The G Play ships with Android 10 installed. While it’s on Motorola’s list to receive an Android 11 update, the timing is unclear and, given the company’s track record, could be many months away. The phone will receive security updates until January 2023. That’s an unfortunately short life span, so you might want to count on trading it in or cashing in your upgrade with your carrier after a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0xKl-_nv-5ScC8ZHGcoPWpzV6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446426/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s just one camera on the Moto G Play’s rear panel — plus a depth sensor and a flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9xrLwx"&gt;Moto G Play camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="la0jKI"&gt;The G Play has just one 13-megapixel rear-facing camera (accompanied by a 2-megapixel depth sensor) and a 5-megapixel selfie camera. That’s it. Even in the budget class, that’s not many cameras in 2021. I don’t think anyone (myself included) will miss having the low-quality macro camera that manufacturers keep putting on their devices these days, but not having an ultrawide is a bummer considering it’s not hard to find a phone that offers one at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZrSppU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10470933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lWH6dz"&gt;If nothing else, the G Play’s camera offerings are very straightforward. There are just two main shooting modes in the native camera app: photo and video. Portrait mode and a few other extras are available in the shooting menu, but there’s no night mode here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vICTq7"&gt;Outside in good lighting, this 13-megapixel camera does okay. Overall exposures are balanced and the camera doesn’t try to do too much HDR-ing, which I appreciate, but you don’t have to look too close to notice that details in grass and leaves are smoothed over. Things go downhill quickly in less good light — the G Play just isn’t up to low-light photography. The selfie camera is also guilty of aggressive over-smoothing at its default “Face Beauty Auto” setting that made my face look like a glazed donut. Thankfully, you can turn this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zPOT-4NqzEVGAxuJIn-F4NNXgcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22446423/ajohnson_20210412_4525_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Play is well-priced for what it offers, but spending a bit more would mean some valuable upgrades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzJkNf"&gt;Clearly the G Play has its share of shortcomings — at $160, it has to. The question is whether these are trade-offs you can live with for a couple of years. If you enjoy a very casual relationship with your phone, the G Play will do all of the things you need it to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="APEtVk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you enjoy a very casual relationship with your phone, the G Play will do all of the things you need it to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Vhl0"&gt;Everyday performance for the basics — light web browsing, social media, email, music — is sufficient. If you just use your phone camera for quick snapshots out and about and don’t expect too much from it, the G Play will do fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E238ck"&gt;If you suspect that you need a little more from your phone, or that you want the experience of using your phone to be a little more enjoyable, then I’d strongly encourage spending a bit more on something like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola’s own Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; for a better camera. Samsung and OnePlus have recent entries in the sub-$200 class that are worth looking at, too; I haven’t tested them, but they’re specced competitively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GJynXC"&gt;If your relationship with technology is less complicated than those of us who spend hours each day of our precious time on this Earth staring at the little glowing screen in our hands, jumping between social media apps, and pushing our phone cameras to their limits, then you’ll get along fine with the Moto G Play. Just spare a thought for the rest of us, please?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vfxNvE"&gt;The European Parliament has &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210422IPR02621/new-rules-adopted-for-quick-and-smooth-removal-of-terrorist-content-online"&gt;formally adopted&lt;/a&gt; a law requiring internet companies to “remove or disable access to flagged terrorist content” within one hour after being notified by national authorities. Once issued, such takedown notices will apply across the EU, with countries able to levy financial penalties against firms that refuse to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sKwlT"&gt;The legislation will come into force 12 months after it is published in the EU’s &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html"&gt;official journal&lt;/a&gt;, a standard step for all EU law. It will then have to be adopted by each member state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4RpZo"&gt;The legislation has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274201/european-terrorist-content-regulation-extremist-terreg-upload-filter-one-hour-takedown-eu"&gt;under discussion&lt;/a&gt; in the EU for years. It was first proposed in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/13/social-media-firms-could-face-huge-fines-over-terrorist-content"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; at a time when terrorist attacks by groups like ISIS were peaking across the &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/security/20180703STO07125/terrorism-in-the-eu-terror-attacks-deaths-and-arrests-in-2019"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt; and lawmakers were worried about online radicalization. Since then the proposals have been making their way through the EU’s legislative bodies, with several major amendments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwKHtJ"&gt;Notably, the legislation now explicitly excludes takedowns targeting terrorist content that’s part of any educational, artistic, journalistic, or academic material. It also includes no obligation for internet companies to preemptively monitor or filter their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oxB7Dq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The law could encourage the use of faulty algorithmic content filters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGWlfv"&gt;However, many MEPs and rights groups are still worried the legislation will have unintended effects. Although companies are under no obligation to filter content, say critics, they might choose to do so in order to avoid having to respond quickly to takedown notices. Such algorithmic filters could be over-zealous, worry experts, blocking legitimate content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imMde8"&gt;“To say that [using automated filters] is not an obligation is to allow it,” Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield, a Green MEP from France, told &lt;a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/news/eu-adopts-law-giving-tech-giants-one-hour-to-remove-terrorist-content/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EURACTIV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Such technology might look particularly attractive in a “context where the algorithm is going to be cheaper than human means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCQhXy"&gt;Another concern is that the one-hour takedown limit is too short a time frame for smaller platforms with fewer resources. Such platforms are often used by terrorist groups to host content precisely because they can’t moderate content. This would make business harder for these companies, stifling competition in a market already dominated by US tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roiPii"&gt;It’s also possible that EU member states could interpret what constitutes “terrorist” content in harmful ways. “This could open the way for authoritarian regimes, like those in Poland and Hungary, to silence their critics abroad by issuing removal orders beyond their borders,” writes &lt;a href="https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/terrorist-content-regulation-open-letter-to-meps/43410"&gt;one civil rights group&lt;/a&gt;. “Because this must happen within the hour, online platforms will have no option but to comply with these orders to avoid fines or legal problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EV charging network ChargePoint now supports Android Auto  </title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Q4crVHGD5kpCNXPN0D7ZvbmWmU=/162x0:1356x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203865/Android_Auto_Screens_Nearby_Stations.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The integration lets you view charging stations directly from your car’s infotainment screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ChargePoint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdPP52"&gt;ChargePoint, operator of one of the largest EV charging networks across Europe and North America, is adding support for Android Auto to its app. The functionality means Android phone users will be able to find, navigate to, and start charging from a ChargePoint charging station from their car’s infotainment screen, without having to pick up their phone. Support for Android Auto follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571093/chargepoint-carplay-app-find-stations-start-charging-electric-cars-ev"&gt;addition of CarPlay support&lt;/a&gt; in November last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmRTb5"&gt;According to ChargePoint, the Android Auto experience lets you view a map with nearby charging stations, check status, filter by metrics like availability and cost, and then start a charging session once you arrive. The in-vehicle app can also be set to notify the driver once a busy charging station becomes available. ChargePoint says its network includes over one hundred thousand charging locations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ChargePoint&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Details about available charging spots can be viewed from the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zadkv0"&gt;The app’s Android Auto support will be available from today in the USA, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. To use it, you’ll need ChargePoint’s app running on a device with Android 6.0 or above, and a car that supports Android Auto. &lt;/p&gt;
