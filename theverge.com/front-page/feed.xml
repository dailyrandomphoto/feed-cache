    <title>Google acquires Neverware, a company that turns old PCs into Chromebooks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZSw8JL"&gt;Today, Neverware &lt;a href="https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-now-part-of-Google-FAQ"&gt;announced in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; that it’s now part of Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFgilf"&gt;Neverware, based in New York City, makes a software application called CloudReady that allows you to convert a PC into a system that runs Chrome OS. In its FAQ, Neverware states that it and its CloudReady software are “officially part of Google and the Chrome OS team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcdbJC"&gt;CloudReady offers a free version for personal use, as well as paid tiers for enterprise and education. The idea is that companies and schools (as well as individuals) can convert old, slow systems into Chromebooks rather than throwing them out — Chrome OS is a less demanding operating system for these machines to run than Windows 10 is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZVs9U"&gt;According to Neverware’s FAQ, not much is going to change for current CloudReady customers in the near future. The company’s website, forums, customer support, and admin portal will continue to function as usual, though it seems that they’ll eventually migrate over to Google’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p18zbV"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/google-acquires-neverware-cloudready-chrome-os-chromebooks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; site notes, some of the software that Neverware makes could help Google continue to push Chrome OS updates to older devices, extending the time frame in which some Chromebooks can receive the latest software. (Google hasn’t said anything of the sort, so that’s just hopeful speculation for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWvcow"&gt;Google and Neverware are well acquainted — Google led an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16455490/google-invest-neverware-chromebooks-refurbish"&gt;investment round&lt;/a&gt; in the startup back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Massachusetts governor won’t sign facial recognition ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcjhZVueXpOjD6WAIiHZH9E0cWI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525691/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIUyre"&gt;Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker has refused to sign a law banning most government use of facial recognition. &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/12/10/metro/baker-sends-police-bill-back-legislature-asking-changes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that Baker sent an omnibus police reform bill back to state lawmakers, asking for changes that included striking the facial recognition rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRC0cT"&gt;Massachusetts legislators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22094902/massachusetts-facial-recognition-ban-bill-vote-passed-police-reform"&gt;passed the first&lt;/a&gt; major state-level facial recognition ban, following a model set by individual cities like Boston and San Francisco. &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963?=11302020"&gt;The bill&lt;/a&gt; says public agencies, including police departments, can’t use or acquire biometric surveillance systems. It makes exceptions for running facial recognition searches against a motor vehicles registration database, as long as police obtain a warrant or demonstrate “immediate danger” that requires a search. It would help fill a gap left by federal lawmakers, who haven’t passed a nationwide framework for using potentially invasive facial recognition technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUVmub"&gt;But in a letter to lawmakers, Baker said the reform package “ignores the important role [facial recognition] can play in solving crime.” His office told the &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt; that he plans to veto the bill if lawmakers don’t make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4h1XbG"&gt;Facial recognition is just one facet of the sweeping bill, which aims to reform police tactics, training, and accountability. The package would create a new oversight commission to investigate misconduct and potentially revoke officers’ licenses, and it would restrict the use of chokeholds, rubber bullets, and tear gas. In addition to the facial recognition ban, &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/12/10/heres-what-charlie-baker-wants-changed-in-the-police-reform-bill"&gt;Baker objected&lt;/a&gt; to policies like shifting police training oversight to a civilian-led committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12zflY"&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts urged lawmakers to reject the proposed changes. “Governor Baker rejected a crucial due process provision that would protect Massachusetts residents from unregulated police use of face surveillance technology, which has been proven to unfairly target Black and brown people, leading to the arrest of innocent people. Unchecked police use of surveillance technology also harms everyone’s rights to anonymity, privacy, and free speech,” said executive director Carol Rose.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now watch HBO Max on your PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A PlayStation 5 in front of a TV showing HBO Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_0VDitIy-PluZd9L1mD4RNDtqM=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525502/DSCF1971.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3VFbSb"&gt;Sony on Wednesday announced that HBO Max is finally available for its next-gen console. Support for the app, revealed in a tweet from the official PlayStation account, should be great news if you managed to get a PS5 and were planning to use it as an entertainment hub for movies in addition to games, as HBO Max was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;last major streaming service&lt;/a&gt; absent from the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtqeaT"&gt;If you’re still on the PS4, this update likely won’t mean much to you, as that device has had the app for a while now. But it does mean any PlayStation fans should now be able to watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, which will be available in 4K HDR for PS5 owners with supported TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;and other Warner Bros. movies&lt;/a&gt; coming out next year on HBO’s new streaming service. (Xbox Series X / S owners have had access to the app since the consoles launched.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v87Z1s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Settle in with the biggest movies and TV series — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; is available now on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PS5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/EYBzSZdJrL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EYBzSZdJrL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1339265875518451717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jI3WwP"&gt;When I went to download HBO Max on my PS5, it told me the app was only available for PS4, but a quick reboot made it available to download. If you want to download it as well, you can go to the media tab on the PS5’s home screen and scroll down to the All Apps section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKS1R2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 4:47 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Removed a line about the app only being available in the US, as HBO Max as a service is only available in the US.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is finally coming to Roku </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v55zOM-iA-FZm6b1Z93IuaG04s4=/31x0:1576x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525627/Screen_Shot_2020_11_19_at_11.17.04_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJvSVY"&gt;One of the biggest hurdles facing &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; is no longer a problem: the streaming service will finally be coming to Roku devices, starting December 17th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLgDIw"&gt;The move comes just after after WarnerMedia announced that it will simultaneously release its 2021 movies on HBO Max the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;same day they debut in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. The move follows &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;debuting on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; the same day as its released in theaters on December 25th. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;and many of Warner Bros.’ 2021 slate&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are the types of movies that will drive subscribers to HBO Max, so it’s a win-win for both parties to have a deal by then. Roku can reap some of the reward from those signups, and HBO Max is now available to tens of millions of people who use Roku devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S73ujb"&gt;Once available, Roku users will be able to simply install the HBO Max channel on their devices, just like any other streaming application. Customers who already have the HBO app installed will be automatically updated to the HBO Max app, too. HBO Max on Roku will also work with Roku Pay, meaning that you’ll be able to subscribe for the service directly through a Roku account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cONTwU"&gt;With approximately 46 million active accounts on Roku, it’s important for WarnerMedia to have HBO Max available to as many of those customers as possible. HBO Max hasn’t been available on Roku since the streaming service launched at the end of May, and WarnerMedia recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569441/hbo-max-amazon-fire-tv-tablets-roku-prime-video-channel-membership"&gt;made an agreement with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; so Fire TV and Fire tablet users could access the app. HBO Max has just over 12 million active subscribers — and while executives publicly state they’re happy with HBO Max’s performance, competitors like Netflix and Disney Plus are growing at faster rates. Disney Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;amassed nearly 87 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in just a little over a year; HBO Max can’t even convince current HBO subscribers to upgrade for no additional cost to Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2JMq2u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Roku’s 46 million accounts will now be able to subscribe to HBO Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXF0Am"&gt;Roku and Amazon make up a combined 33 percent market share for people who stream entertainment, according to Parks Associates. Not being on those platforms has likely played a role in HBO Max’s less-than-stellar subscriber numbers over the last several months. Considering that HBO has more than 35 million subscribers in the United States, and all of those subscribers can sign up for Max for free, WarnerMedia has only activated 12.7 million customers. Not great! Up until now, Roku and WarnerMedia have been in a long-standing reverse carriage dispute — something traditional television has dealt with for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6w7BIO"&gt;Think of it like this: cable operators pay television networks to carry their channels. If they want content, cable operators have to pay for it. When distribution arguments arise, these become carriage disputes. Consumers know these situations as blackouts. Suddenly, a channel that was once available is no longer. Essentially, one party holds out from distributing until an agreement is reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBSMKM"&gt;Streaming hubs like Roku want new players like WarnerMedia (when it comes to HBO Max) &lt;em&gt;to pay them&lt;/em&gt;. The same result happens: negotiations are held until it’s resolved — it’s essentially a reversed carriage dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obKwpa"&gt;The bottom line is WarnerMedia needs Roku to reach the tens of millions of people who use that as a primary entertainment source. Roku would like to give HBO Max to its customers so they spend more time in that overall ecosystem. A deal was inevitable, but not having Roku as a partner the second HBO Max went live, leading to mass confusion, didn’t help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pyihvf"&gt;

    <title>A Canadian astronaut will fly around the Moon on the first crewed mission of NASA’s new rocket</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-4JZbqx3oCXBj60MKcoQB76E8A=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525620/maf_20200108_artemis_roll_out_dn_5673_0__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vKW5Xq"&gt;One of Canada’s astronauts will be sent around the Moon as part of a partnership between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-canadian-space-agency-formalize-gateway-partnership-for-artemis-program/"&gt;NASA announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The two organizations have formally agreed to collaborate on building a lunar space station called the Lunar Gateway. The Gateway is just one part of NASA’s larger Artemis program, which is focused on landing a woman on the Moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WK8tI9"&gt;A Canadian astronaut will participate in NASA’s planned Artemis II mission, and the CSA also has a seat on a future flight to the Gateway once it is complete. By joining the Artemis II mission, Canada will become the second country to have an astronaut fly around the Moon, the CSA says. Canada currently has &lt;a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronauts/canadian/active/default.asp"&gt;just four active astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, and the CSA has not announced which will be participating in this partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBstln"&gt;Artemis I is the uncrewed test of NASA’s new rocket, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/overview.html"&gt;the Space Launch System (SLS)&lt;/a&gt;, and its Orion capsule. Artemis II will be the first flight of the system with people on board, and during its 10-day mission, the crew will test the spacecraft’s systems on a trip that will take them &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-first-flight-with-crew-important-step-on-long-term-return-to-the-moon-missions-to"&gt;4,600 miles past the far side of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Actually landing on the Moon is planned for the next mission, Artemis III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vi8vi7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRSNeGXTj6Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOnDbZ"&gt;Along with crew, the partnership signed today says that the CSA will provide &lt;a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/canadarm3/about.asp"&gt;external robotics assistance for the Gateway, including the construction of Canadarm3&lt;/a&gt;, an autonomous robotics system with multiple arms and detachable tools. Canadarm3 will inspect and repair the outside of the Gateway, catch visiting vehicles, and relocate modules of the Gateway as it orbits the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nj8RYZ"&gt;Building and maintaining the Gateway is a critical step in NASA’s plan to create a long-term foothold on the Moon. The Gateway is intended as a research station and rest stop for longer missions to the Moon and into deep space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiXrL3"&gt;Whether NASA can meet its ambitious goal of landing people on the Moon in 2024 remains to be seen. NASA has struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173176/nasa-space-launch-system-inspector-general-audit-over-budget-schedule"&gt;budgeting issues in building the SLS&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726753/nasa-orion-crew-capsule-power-unit-failure-artemis-i"&gt;component failure in the Orion capsule&lt;/a&gt; it’s supposed to carry. Despite the concern, NASA says it will still be able to launch the Artemis I mission in November 2021. Artemis II, with its new Canadian crew member in tow, is planned for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch bans ‘simp’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsnLHkzJPBF0_93ILPdQ6A3z_Mg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525493/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B02KAQ"&gt;Twitch will no longer allow streamers and commenters to go around calling one another “simps.” The term — a recent favorite in the Twitch community that nominally refers to men who seem desperate for a woman’s attention — will be banned when used as an insult under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165342/twitch-hateful-conduct-harassment-policy-update"&gt;Twitch’s upcoming revamp of its harassment policy&lt;/a&gt;. “Incel” and “virgin” will be banned as insults, too, Twitch COO Sara Clemens said during a live-streamed town hall this afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a18Nyy"&gt;The new policy, first spotted by esports consultant &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1339312480057782273"&gt;Rod Breslau&lt;/a&gt;, will go into effect on January 22nd. It also includes stricter rules around sexual harassment and seems to give Twitch more leeway to ban streamers and commenters who make offensive comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fq7VeV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitch is also rejecting emotes that include “simp”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BeE5XR"&gt;The policy overhaul comes after Twitch was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers"&gt;inundated with reports of sexual harassment within its community&lt;/a&gt; and complaints that the company had ignored the issue for years. Twitch said in June that it was “committed to continuing our efforts to make Twitch a safer environment” and that a review of its hateful conduct and harassment policies was underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVlRW1"&gt;“Simp” is being banned under a portion of the revamped policy that prohibits derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual preferences. “And that does include negatively targeting another person with sexually focused terms,” Clemens said. Twitch is also “proactively denying” emotes that include all three of these terms as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mgFk5T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=NastyFragileTomatoSeemsGood&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBOc5f"&gt;The words “simp,” “incel,” and “virgin” will not be banned in all situations. Twitch will only take action when they’re used for harassment — but, typically, that’s how these terms come up on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqpu9l"&gt;“We will take action against the use of terms like ‘simp,’ ‘incel’ or ‘virgin’ specifically when they are being used to negatively refer to another person’s sexual practices. Using these terms on their own wouldn’t lead to an enforcement but we would take action if they were used repeatedly in a harassing manner,” a Twitch spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgGXFO"&gt;Twitch’s &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/"&gt;updated harassment policy&lt;/a&gt; lists a number of banned behaviors relating to sexual harassment. Among them is a ban on “making derogatory statements about another person’s perceived sexual practices or sexual morality.” The policy goes on to say that would include “repeatedly negatively targeting another person with sexually-focused terms, such as ‘whore’ or ‘virgin.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYl51p"&gt;There aren’t details on exactly how Twitch will enforce the ban around “simp.” But moderators may find it to be tricky given just how often the term is thrown around on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Twitch for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TQU5G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 16th, 5:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a statement from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An absolutely wild mod has brought real-time ray tracing to the SNES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A picture of a Famicom console with many wires coming out of it, hooked up to a TV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERpeQFrlGxSFhRwkpupyCxMAVmc=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68525132/Hardware.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Ben Carter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tKdolZ"&gt;Ray-tracing technology, available for a few years on PC, has finally come to consoles: the PS5 has it, the Xbox Series S and X have it, and, 30 years after its release, the SNES is getting it. No joke — the Nintendo console from 1990 has had ray tracing run on it, &lt;a href="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/"&gt;thanks to an incredible mod&lt;/a&gt; by programmer Ben Carter (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superhuman-hack-brings-real-time-3d-ray-tracing-to-the-1845890359"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). And it’s done by a chip he’s calling SuperRT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PldbRI"&gt;Ray tracing is usually used to make games look more realistic by simulating the way light bounces off of surfaces, leading to color bleeding from bright objects and reflecting off of shiny surfaces. As you can see from the video demo above, the tech on the SNES isn’t pushing any graphics boundaries, but come on — it’s an SNES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1P5nIQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mod offers a look at an alternate reality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vRFTu"&gt;Well, technically, it’s a Famicom, which is the same hardware in different packaging for Japan. The real magic, though, is that it’s a totally stock console (except for the fact that the top has been taken off to make room for a ton of wires): all of the processing is being done by a chip Carter programmed and added to a game cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuKMwm"&gt;Adding processing power to the SNES by adding another processor to the game cartridge isn’t something new: &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/super-nintendo-game-uses-super-fx-chip/"&gt;Nintendo did it&lt;/a&gt; with both &lt;em&gt;Star Fox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yoshi’s Island. &lt;/em&gt;(Of course, it was adding 3D functionality and special effects, not ray tracing.) To achieve real-time ray tracing, Carter couldn’t just use the old Super FX chips that Nintendo did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjjHoo"&gt;Instead, he had to use a modern field-programmable gate array chip (FPGA), which allowed him to take information about the scene being rendered by the SNES and process the ray tracing for it. If you want an in-depth look at how it’s done, Carter &lt;a href="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/"&gt;has a blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining how he did it. He also has a video explaining his methodology, embedded below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vSJ72w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jee4tlakqo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oycKip"&gt;This mod is super cool, not just from an engineering and hacking perspective, but because it offers a look at an alternate reality — not the one where ray tracing was magically created in the 1990s, but one where ’90s low-poly 3D games are remastered but keep the art style. As someone who grew up around that time, I love seeing 2D and 3D games get modern-looking remakes, but I’d also love to see the art style come back with modern tricks like ray tracing and anti-aliasing. And if I had to imagine what it would look like, it’d be a lot like Carter’s demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxXySg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says it will start removing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NrKZe-cHb1EiR3FxmFoydRigRLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524971/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVykEr"&gt;Twitter announced Wednesday that it will remove tweets making false or misleading claims about COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRtO0N"&gt;Any tweets claiming that vaccines “intentionally cause harm to control populations” or invoke conspiracy theories will be subject to removal, according to Twitter’s blog post. Tweets falsely suggesting that COVID-19 doesn’t exist or espouse “widely debunked” claims may also be removed. Enforcement of the new policy will begin next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbTMeN"&gt;Twitter may also label or place warnings on tweets pushing vaccine conspiracy theories starting early next year. These labeled tweets could link out to authoritative public health information, similar to how Twitter directed users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;verified voting information&lt;/a&gt; throughout the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1L80IM"&gt;“We will enforce this policy in close consultation with local, national and global public health authorities around the world, and will strive to be iterative and transparent in our approach,” the blog post said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCcyFz"&gt;Twitter’s new policy comes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174075/coronavirus-vaccinations-begin-first-pfizer-health-care-workers"&gt;health care workers across the US&lt;/a&gt; have started to receive COVID-19 vaccinations after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech&lt;/a&gt;. These vaccinations have been the target of countless conspiracy theories, including false allegations that they &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-coronavirus-vaccine-conspiracy-myths-20201215-ubpqu26xarh75gksodmqhgnrp4-story.html"&gt;contain microchips&lt;/a&gt; or are used to alter DNA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIBhRj"&gt;The new rules expand on coronavirus-related policies put in place by Twitter earlier this year. In March, Twitter rolled out a COVID-19 tab in its Explore page and &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/covid-19.html"&gt;partnered with organizations&lt;/a&gt; like the World Health Organization to supply reputable coronavirus information on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2PzF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas attorney general announces ad tech antitrust probe against Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9URvrvurbx3vTbq1j5nWyF05fKE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524894/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LtirH5"&gt;Texas’ state attorney general has announced new antitrust charges against Google, focusing on the company’s ad tech practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2cQdi"&gt;In a bizarre video posted to the office’s verified Twitter account, Texas AG Ken Paxton says the company “repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing” in online ads. “These actions harm every person in America,” Paxton continues. “It isn’t fair that Google can harm the web pages you visit and read.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="th3dRI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#BREAKING&lt;/a&gt;: Texas takes the lead once more! Today, we’re filing a lawsuit against &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Google?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Google&lt;/a&gt; for anticompetitive conduct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This internet Goliath used its power to manipulate the market, destroy competition, and harm YOU, the consumer. Stay tuned… &lt;a href="https://t.co/fdEVEWQb0e"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fdEVEWQb0e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1339283520099856384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EUaJcw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20428869-the_state_of_texas_et_al_v_google__txedce-20-00957__00010"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt; specifically takes issue with Google’s historical requirements for publishers, whether limiting them to a single exchange or extracting licensing fees for the use of Google ad servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPb2dt"&gt;The most detailed allegation is that Google used its market power to sabotage “header bidding,” a practice that allows advertisers to route a single request through multiple exchanges at once. “Google viewed header bidding’s promotion of genuine competition as a major threat,” the complaint alleges, citing internal communications obtained as part of the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emzuRz"&gt;Google eventually adopted the practice, allowing its ad server to route requests through multiple exchanges at once. But according to the complaint, Google rigged that system to rout requests to its own exchange, even when a competitor had submitted a higher bid. Google allegedly codenamed this effort after a character from the Star Wars films, although the specific character is redacted in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhShqA"&gt;Eight other Republican-led states have joined the lawsuit, including Missouri, Kentucky, and Indiana. Some collaborating states reportedly left the lawsuit after &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/05/texas-ken-paxton-bribery/"&gt;several members of Paxton’s staff accused him of accepting bribes&lt;/a&gt;, triggering a broader crisis within the state office. More recently, Paxton’s office has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-texas/texas-hiring-two-law-firms-for-google-probe-team-idUSKBN28Q01H"&gt;hired private law firms &lt;/a&gt;specifically to work on the Google case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtNzLV"&gt;Reached for comment, Google denied the claim that digital ad markets are suffering from consolidation, citing &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/display-buying-share-revenue-publishers/"&gt;recent declines in prices and fees&lt;/a&gt;. “Attorney General Paxton’s ad tech claims are meritless, yet he’s gone ahead in spite of all the facts,” a company representative said. “Digital ad prices have fallen over the last decade. Ad tech fees are falling too. Google’s ad tech fees are lower than the industry average. These are the hallmarks of a highly competitive industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xw2dq"&gt;Today’s case joins a number of parallel antitrust cases being brought against the tech giant. In October, the Department of Justice filed antitrust charges focusing specifically on Google’s contracts with companies like Apple and Mozilla to maintain its dominance in search. Texas has also joined that case as a co-plaintiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1r8HYs"&gt;A third case led by Colorado’s state attorney general is also rumored to be close to filing. The Colorado case would focus on how Google’s search engine design has disadvantaged rivals like Yelp and Genius that also offer competing information services. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/12/15/exclusive-states-close-to-filing-new-google-antitrust-suit-1347018"&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; said a complaint could be filed “as soon as Thursday,” citing two people close to the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RMocb4"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20428869-the_state_of_texas_et_al_v_google__txedce-20-00957__00010/?embed=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="The_State_Of_Texas_et_al_V_Google__txedce-20-00957__0001.0 (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ki4tk7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include the official complaint filed against Google, with clarifications throughout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good luck getting a Cyberpunk 2077 refund if you bought a digital PlayStation copy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xKQakIZoV4hUjy5vYRZ4b91o2Y=/306x0:3546x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68524645/Cyberpunk_2077_screen_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n1LAxV"&gt;The release of CD Projekt Red’s (CDPR) highly anticipated &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is becoming an even bigger mess, and buyers of the digital version of the game from Sony’s PlayStation Store might not have an easy path — or any path at all — to receive the refund the developer said they could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcavOJ"&gt;Sony hasn’t officially commented on whether players who bought the game from its digital storefront are eligible for refunds. The company’s official policy is not to refund customers if they started playing a game “unless the content is faulty.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy4QTa"&gt;Now, a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevekovach/status/1339256379014524928"&gt;message from PlayStation Support to CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journalist Steve Kovach&lt;/a&gt; appears to further confirm that your only option in this scenario is to turn to CDPR’s own help line it opened specifically to address console refunds for the game. “CD Projekt Red is currently working on patches and updates to fix bugs and crashes, and to improve overall gameplay experience of Cyberpunk 2077,” reads the PlayStation Support message, implying frustrated players on PS4 should simply wait for the developer to fix the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cc4CIW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sony won't refund my Cyberpunk 2077 order, even after the game's developer said buyers experiencing problems could get refunds. The game literally crashes my PS4 and is unplayable. Sony's answer? Wait for the updates. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zx2LSRhqqN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zx2LSRhqqN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevekovach/status/1339256379014524928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dfeumx"&gt;Sony did not respond to an official request for comment yesterday regarding its policy on &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;refunds. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out again for further clarification regarding this message from PlayStation Support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6HGeo"&gt;For those not immersed in the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launch, let’s back up a bit. The game released last Tuesday, and it became immediately clear that it was plagued by bugs and deep-seated performance issues that make the game an extremely frustrating experience on the standard PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms. While it runs generally okay on PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and Stadia (although with plenty of bugs and crashes depending on your platform and your PC hardware and settings), the game is not well-equipped to handle old and underpowered hardware first released in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFciYB"&gt;In the wake of widespread criticism on social media and from game review sites, none of which were able to review the console versions of the game prior to launch, CDPR &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; recommending players who want their money back from the console version of the game request a refund. The company said to request refunds from Microsoft or Sony, and to email the developer as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yNk0Ai"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/jtF5WKCiro"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jtF5WKCiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ubR6PV"&gt;What CDPR didn’t say at the time was that it had no official refund policy in place with Microsoft, Sony, or any retail partners. The company’s executives only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;revealed as much in a call with investors earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, where they blamed oversight and a fixation on the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S versions of the game for the issues plaguing current-gen platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISOOsW"&gt;Microsoft has since released a statement advising players to pursue its standard refund policy, which does appear to allow most players to get their money back if they request a refund within 14 days of purchase. Sony, on the other hand, does not have as generous of a policy. And retail stores don’t have to honor refunds at all, considering they already purchased the stock from the developer’s publishing partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n7GMh"&gt;Now, many players are stuck with their only recourse at this time involving manually contacting a CDPR email address to try to get their money back. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickklepek/status/1339228060340670464"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;’s Patrick Klepek&lt;/a&gt;, some customers are receiving an automated message back from the developer telling them that they’ll receive an update on their refund most likely before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cPtvUk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;People are starting to get this response back from CD Projekt RED, after emailing their “help” address for refunds. The language is interesting: it doesn’t tell you to request a refund from Sony anymore. You’re supposed to wait. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Hb77SQ5teD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Hb77SQ5teD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Patrick Klepek (@patrickklepek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickklepek/status/1339228060340670464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7QfEG"&gt;In this new message CDPR is sending out, it’s advising players to pursue refunds for digital Xbox versions of the game through Microsoft’s standard refund policy, which anecdotally appears to be working for many players. But CDPR also seems to subtly cast blame on Sony here for not honoring refunds, telling PlayStation players to “please wait for us to get back to you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZpIxC"&gt;The situation is nothing short of a disaster for all parties involved, and it doesn’t look like it’s going to improve any time soon. CDPR is planning two major patches for January and February to fix bugs and improve performance on all platforms, which means the game should improve in due time. But until then, people disappointed in the game who want their money back will need to either be on the right platform to do so or will have to wait to see if CDPR can remedy the situation one way or another. &lt;/p&gt;
