    <title>Venmo leaked Joe Biden’s friends, but you can now keep yours a secret</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Venmo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W46wb25jB5GMIgQLdPkUgUiWs1g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69359211/venmo1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ZfrMK"&gt;Venmo has added new privacy controls for friend lists following a jaw-dropping incident where &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; was able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436847/venmo-contact-friends-list-not-private-president-joe-biden"&gt;track down President Joe Biden’s Venmo account&lt;/a&gt; because of the app’s leaky privacy protocols. App researcher Jane Manchun Wong discovered &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1398383802146168833"&gt;earlier on Friday&lt;/a&gt; that Venmo was working on the new controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJeRiD"&gt;“We’re consistently evolving and strengthening the Venmo platform for all of our customers. As part of these ongoing efforts, we are enhancing our in-app controls providing customers an option to select a public, friends-only, or private setting for their friends list,” a Venmo spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlIHno"&gt;To find the new controls, tap the hamburger icon while on the main feed, then tap “Settings,” “Privacy,” and then “Friends List.” The Friends List menu appeared for me and another &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer while I was writing this article, so if it hasn’t rolled out to you just yet, sit tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI6yrB"&gt;In the new menu, you can pick if you want your friends list to be public, visible to friends, or private. You can also toggle whether or not you want to appear in others users’ friends list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buKJForJKGv1Vlo__xMkhgmM8x8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22547066/IMG_0591.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqMdsB"&gt;The new toggles fix a major privacy hole in Venmo that has been known for years: there previously was no way to keep your list of Venmo contacts private, meaning that you could see the contact list of any other user on the platform. The hole was bad enough that following a brief mention of Biden using Venmo in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/us/politics/joe-biden-policy-decisions.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; profile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was able to track down the president’s account in less than 10 minutes. The publication also found the accounts for many in his inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kHpuC"&gt;While you’re in your privacy settings, I’d also recommend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"&gt;setting your Venmo feed to private&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2rB0PM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PSA for US Congresspeople: here’s how to set your Venmo feed to private","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cgcYj4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: Clarified that Venmo’s previous friend settings included a privacy flaw, not a security flaw.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays Podcasts subscriptions to June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4N2LqGV-Go2B5YClyIs2R8yGGgs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69359138/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n0NyLH"&gt;Apple is delaying the launch of its upcoming Podcasts subscriptions until June, the company announced in an email sent to creators Friday (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/28/apple-delaying-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-until-june-promises-improvements-to-podcasts-app/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The service was previously set to launch this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjbNaY"&gt;Apple’s Podcasts subscriptions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;will allow people&lt;/a&gt; to subscribe to participating podcasts to get extra perks like ad-free listening or early access to episodes. In April, Apple said the subscriptions would launch in 170 countries, and that initial partners include Pushkin Industries and NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq5QCY"&gt;The shifted launch comes as some creators using Apple Podcasts &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28"&gt;have recently run into some issues&lt;/a&gt;, such as being unable to log in to Apple’s Podcast Connect portal or seeing a delay in the availability of new episodes. In its email sent Friday, Apple said it has fixed the “disruptions” that presented problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7UXzb"&gt;You can read Apple’s full email to creators below, which the company shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ka4avf"&gt;We’re writing to provide an update on the availability of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions and channels. We’ve been delighted by the response to last month’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22459129%2Fapple-delays-podcasts-subscriptions-june" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; and it’s exciting to see the hundreds of new subscriptions and channels submitted from creators across the globe every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvdhoL"&gt;To ensure we are delivering the best experience for creators and listeners, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions and channels will now launch in June. We will communicate further updates on availability, and best practices to help you prepare your subscriptions and channels, through this newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nna6d5"&gt;Over the last few weeks, some creators have experienced delays in the availability of their content and access to Apple Podcasts Connect. We’ve addressed these disruptions and encourage creators experiencing any issues to &lt;a href="https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/contactus"&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY27Uc"&gt;We’ve also heard from listeners and made adjustments based on their feedback with iOS 14.6, which was released on Monday. We will introduce additional enhancements to Library in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCvcwF"&gt;Thank you for your understanding. We can’t wait to see your new subscriptions and channels and we are looking forward to launching them to listeners around the world soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Ladies and gentlemen, the weekendgelion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 45" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETQOELhxD2F1BoNLiu5xDYuy5jE=/1x0:3000x1999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358844/1205774770.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hlu54k"&gt;You have reached a significant moment, perhaps not in history, or even in the grand scheme of your life’s long arc toward love and fulfillment, but a significant moment nonetheless. Do I need to spell it out for you? It’s 5PM. On a Friday. Heading into a long weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uTZJpa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...Ladies and Gentlemen...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neon Genesis Weekendgelion &lt;a href="https://t.co/n5oB1Vneml"&gt;pic.twitter.com/n5oB1Vneml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— andy (@andymoney69) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymoney69/status/1398308089540104197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uKSJsV"&gt;What is a “weekendgelion,” you may be asking? Obviously it’s the portmanteau of “weekend” and “Neon Genesis Evangelion.” You could have just Googled that, but I understand — it’s your time off! I respect your commitment to doing the bare minimum for the next three days. What does a beloved ‘90s anime series have to do with, as the above video’s creator puts it, the pursuit of &lt;strong&gt;COLD BEER&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GOOD FRIENDS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;FREEDOM&lt;/strong&gt;? On its face, absolutely nothing, other than that its theme song — “A Cruel Angel’s Thesis”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lYHqmS"&gt;has been memetic fodder since it was technologically feasible for unpaid internet goons to insert it into unrelated situations or media properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9bGC7I"&gt;was briefly Twitter’s main character this week, after &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22456627/olympics-documentary-anime-olympics-neon-genesis-evangelion"&gt;a very real, official, Olympic hockey documentary&lt;/a&gt; was rediscovered entirely because of the song’s straight-faced inclusion in its opening montage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WItSJO"&gt;should be the anthem to all summer and pre-summer cookouts going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="RnNc9l"&gt;Perhaps you’re not in my timezone (Eastern Standard, the ideal timezone, &lt;em&gt;New York numbah one babyyy&lt;/em&gt;), in which case this post either isn’t for you yet or has hopefully failed to reach your screen because you are already slung across a hammock, covered in snack crumbs and lightly doused in the hedonistically dribbled leavings of your beverage of choice. Good job! Everyone else, please delete Slack from your phone, toss said phone into the nearest ocean or freshwater body, and get on hammock guy’s level. Not that it’s a contest. The last thing anyone should be doing right now is expending effort of any kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNF9KZ"&gt;You made it to the weekendgelion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94pNhG"&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7MBIt"&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jDaFM"&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5Tfwq"&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2WY23"&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9t9B0"&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter could be working on Facebook-style reactions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMNP5fXFG_weU-bb7qXXL-sl-lU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358829/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8KgMGk"&gt;Twitter could be adding some new emojis to augment its formerly star-shaped, currently heart-shaped Like button, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1398359547731841024"&gt;according to app researcher&lt;/a&gt; Jane Manchun Wong. The assets Wong found — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;have been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284406/twitter-verified-back-badges-blue-check"&gt;reliable predictions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/4/21500687/twitter-birdwatch-misinfo-tool-propaganda"&gt;of future features&lt;/a&gt; in the past — show “cheer,” “hmm,” “sad,” and “haha” emoji reactions, though some currently only have a placeholder emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0FaAq"&gt;Facebook has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/24/11094374/facebook-reactions-like-button"&gt;similar set of reactions since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. But Wong’s leak shows that Twitter could be taking a slightly different path when it comes to which moods it wants users to express: while it has laughing and sad expressions in common with Facebook, Twitter may also include a makes-you-think and cheer option. Twitter doesn’t seem to have the “angry” expression that Facebook does, but that may be because anger on Twitter is already handled by the reply and quote tweet functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0yhNaE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on Tweet Reactions view:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Likes”, “Cheer”, “Hmm”, “Sad”, “Haha”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The icons for the Cheer and Sad reactions are WIP and shown as the generic heart one at the moment &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZCBhH8z7JR"&gt;https://t.co/ZCBhH8z7JR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/dGqq1CzIis"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dGqq1CzIis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1398359547731841024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GEJq8Z"&gt;We’ve seen another glance at this feature when Twitter asked users about the addition of emoji reactions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348952/twitter-emoji-reactions-downvotes-tweets-testing-features"&gt;in a survey a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;. In response to a request for comment, Twitter told us the same thing it did last time: that it is “always exploring additional ways for people to express themselves in conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOx8Cp"&gt;Twitter seems to be busy with new features recently: we’ve heard rumors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;a premium subscription service&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve seen the rollout of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;larger pictures&lt;/a&gt;, its audio-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455799/twitter-spaces-web-browser-clubhouse-social-audio-room"&gt;Spaces feature&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;tests of a tip jar feature&lt;/a&gt;. The company even started back up its verification program (before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;pausing it again just over a week later&lt;/a&gt;). Perhaps the only thing Twitter isn’t working on is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458555/florida-deplatforming-law-twitter-facebook-snap-pinterest-tiktok-youtube-google"&gt;a theme park to deal with Florida’s deplatforming law&lt;/a&gt;, but considering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169773/twitter-acquires-squad-screen-sharing-video-chat"&gt;disparate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; it’s been making of late, it’s too early to ignore the possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp reverses course, now won’t limit functionality if you don’t accept its new privacy policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tk32lbpAQav_fGor-avVbnLoPgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358713/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3at86H"&gt;Earlier this month, Facebook-owned WhatsApp said that users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424769/whatsapp-privacy-policy-deadline-controversy-functionality"&gt;would lose functionality over time&lt;/a&gt; if they didn’t accept its new privacy policy by May 15th. In a reversal, Facebook now says that plan has changed, and users who don’t accept the updated policy actually &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; see limited functionality (&lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/whatsapp-says-it-wont-limit-functionality-if-you-refuse-its-privacy-policy-for-now"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TNW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6Z45W"&gt;“Given recent discussions with various authorities and privacy experts, we want to make clear that we will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works for those who have not yet accepted the update,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. WhatsApp tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this is the plan moving forward indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dToMmq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new policy has been a source of controversy for months&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XCz95w"&gt;The rollout of the policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;has been a confusing mess&lt;/a&gt;, and raised concerns that WhatsApp would begin sharing more of users’ personal data with Facebook. (Some WhatsApp user data, such as users’ phone numbers, is already shared with Facebook, a policy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;went into place in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.) WhatsApp has stressed this is not the case, though — the policy update is regarding messages sent to businesses via WhatsApp, which may be stored on Facebook’s servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vmw6uy"&gt;The majority of users who have seen the new policy have accepted, &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/?lang=en"&gt;the company says in a support article&lt;/a&gt;. This article also notes that you’ll get reminded about the new policy if you haven’t accepted it, and that’s still the case now, WhatsApp said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8GVly"&gt;“We will continue to remind users from time to time and let them accept the update, including when they choose to use relevant optional features like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook,” WhatsApp said. “We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK police surprised to learn energy-intensive weed farm is actually a Bitcoin mine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uv9x7DTS_aUmKQVimQOGNCHf9C0=/0x117:1401x1051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358663/Crypto_mine_WM.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: West Midlands Police&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hi6PFZ"&gt;Police in the United Kingdom raided an industrial unit outside Birmingham under suspicion it was housing an indoor marijuana growing operation, CNBC &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/bitcoin-mine-discovered-by-uk-police-on-cannabis-farm-raid-.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href="https://www.west-midlands.police.uk/news/bitcoin-mine-uncovered-during-industrial-unit-raid"&gt;were surprised to discover&lt;/a&gt; instead an extensive Bitcoin mining setup which was illegally siphoning electricity from a mains supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKLY7K"&gt;Prior to the raid, police observed multiple people going in and out of the building throughout the day, and spotted extensive ventilation and wiring. They also claim a drone was able to detect high amounts of heat coming off the building. Because indoor cannabis farms use systems of grow lights, heating, and ventilation to cultivate plants where they might not usually flourish, police believed they were looking at “classic signs” of a clandestine weed operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TkDYSk"&gt;What they were actually looking at, as they soon learned, was about approximately a hundred or so &lt;a href="https://99bitcoins.com/antminer-s9-review/"&gt;Antminer S9 machines&lt;/a&gt;, generating enormous amounts of heat while they minted new coins. Easy mistake to make, and incidentally, not illegal in cases where cryptocurrency miners pay their electrical bills. This particular operation, however, was siphoning “thousands of pounds” worth of mains electricity, and as a result was shut down by the same police who thought they were gearing up for a drug raid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FI0lVO"&gt;The mining equipment, which we can estimate as being worth &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fp%2F10023346379&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F28%2F22458632%2Fbitcoin-mine-mistaken-cannabis-growing-operation-police" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;upward of $5,000&lt;/a&gt;, was seized, though no arrests have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyznXF"&gt;Police may not have caught a drug ring, but they likely did more good by shutting down this illicit mining setup — for the environment anyway. In 2016, weed was found to account for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/27/marijuana-industry-huge-energy-footprint"&gt;1 percent of the electricity consumption&lt;/a&gt; in the US, an equivalent of 15 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, at the time. For comparison, Bitcoin was estimated to be responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682109/bitcoin-energy-consumption-annual-calculation-cambridge-index-cbeci-country-comparison"&gt;almost 0.25 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;the entire world’s&lt;/em&gt; electricity consumption in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just over a week after relaunching verification, Twitter is pausing verification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mh1Gv_Qb6LuWKdDOkJgP3IN6Xz4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358462/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBHGFv"&gt;Twitter relaunched its verification program last week, allowing anyone to apply for a blue check mark, but the company is pausing accepting new applications because of the volume of applications it has already received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXbiSm"&gt;“We’re rolling in verification requests,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1398359044054790153"&gt;the company said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “So we gotta hit pause on accepting any more for now while we review the ones that have been submitted. We’ll reopen requests soon! (we pinky swear)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfg4G7"&gt;When it officially opened the program for applications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22435770/twitter-public-verification-program-launch-2021-pronouns-profile"&gt;on May 20th&lt;/a&gt;, the company cautioned that the timeline for requests could stretch out. “Once you submit your application, you can expect an emailed response from us within a few days, but this could take up to a few weeks depending on how many open applications are in our queue,” &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/relaunching-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;Twitter said in a blog&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the volume of applications has already become so large that Twitter has made the choice to pause applications entirely, just eight days after the program reopened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0BcYi"&gt;With the new program (when it’s open, that is), anyone can apply to receive the coveted blue check, so it’s not altogether surprising that there have been an overwhelming number of applications. Under the new guidelines, six categories of accounts can qualify for verification: government; companies, brands, and organizations; news organizations and journalists; entertainment; sports and gaming; and activists, organizers, and other influential individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lbiGF"&gt;Twitter previously suspended the verification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt; after it verified the account of a white supremacist. The company went back to the drawing board on its verification policies, introducing the new ones &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes’ lawyers want to know how often jurors blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CF7pwmjZAwGWxaH3pTnkOwpwD7k=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358241/1316519218.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nhat V. Meyer/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5V2Q1v"&gt;The lawyers of Elizabeth Holmes, ex-CEO of disgraced blood testing startup Theranos, have 112 questions for prospective jurors at Holmes’ fraud trial — including how often they check social media and whether they subscribe to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GP9YdM"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-has-over-100-questions-for-jurors-11622217048"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, Holmes’ attorneys have just filed a proposed jury questionnaire for her &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/30/20532321/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-blood-testing-startup-trial-date-set-august-2020"&gt;upcoming fraud trial&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; detailed &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327949/gov.uscourts.cand.327949.808.0.pdf"&gt;45-page document&lt;/a&gt; outlines every possible way Holmes fears a jury could be biased, and part of that apparently involves gauging &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how online each juror is. Among other questions, jurors are asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BSHsSI"&gt;“Do you have an account on any social media platforms? If yes, please identify the platform(s).”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xPBBEr"&gt;“How frequently do you use the platform(s) listed above?” (Answers range from “multiple times per day” to “almost never.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z38lzu"&gt;“How do you use social media? (for example, communicate with friends; express opinions; follow current events; etc.)”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S266WD"&gt;“Do you belong to any groups on social media (ex. Facebook or WhatsApp groups)?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jE8V10"&gt;“Have you ever posted messages, comments, or opinions on websites/social media, or blogged? If yes, please describe the websites or social media platforms that you have used; the types of things you have posted or blogged; and how often you have done it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="P09Hqw"&gt;The questionnaire underscores the sheer breadth of media coverage around Theranos, with numerous questions gauging how (and how much) jurors engage with media. On the more general side, that includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="04CE5G"&gt;“Have you ever written a letter to the editor or called into a radio show?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zz6Jzm"&gt;“How much in the news media do you believe is fair and accurate?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GyNKLj"&gt;Then it asks whether potential jurors read, watch, or listen to any of 46 text news outlets, 15 individual media figures, and 19 video or audio outlets — mostly news stations, but also Hulu, Netflix, and HBO. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is not named on the questionnaire, although fellow Vox Media outlets &lt;em&gt;Vox &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; are.) That’s on top of questions about whether the jurors have consumed media about Holmes and Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfOsvy"&gt;By contrast, US prosecutors — who filed their own &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.327949/gov.uscourts.cand.327949.802.0.pdf"&gt;51-question proposal&lt;/a&gt; yesterday — asked participants to list their “main sources of news” and if they follow “financial news” specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XELVMy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prosecutors called the questionnaire “deeply intrusive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bGP5YD"&gt;Prosecutors called Holmes’ form “far too long, deeply intrusive in unnecessary ways, argumentative, and repetitive” in a court filing. Beyond the social media questions, the form asks jurors to specify things like whether any family members or close acquaintances have experience with 26 different professional fields and government agencies. But Holmes’ lawyers claimed the entrepreneur was “routinely referred to in derisive and inflammatory terms,” making the questions pertinent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKDOJK"&gt;That’s not an unfair description of Holmes’ media portrayal, although getting rich off &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901?mod=article_inline"&gt;a medical device that doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt; is arguably worthy of derision. It’s also a little ironic, because news outlets &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-media-emperors-new-startup"&gt;were once criticized&lt;/a&gt; for hyping Theranos without sufficient fact-checking. As Holmes’ filing notes, however, Theranos’ fall is now chronicled in a well-known book (&lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt; by John Carreyrou), documentary (HBO’s &lt;em&gt;The Inventor&lt;/em&gt;), and multiple podcasts (Tyler Shultz’s &lt;em&gt;Thicker Than Water&lt;/em&gt; and Rebecca Jarvis’ &lt;em&gt;The Dropout&lt;/em&gt;), plus an &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/amanda-seyfried-elizabeth-holmes-the-dropout-hulu-theranos-kate-mckinnon-1234723500/"&gt;upcoming Hulu miniseries&lt;/a&gt; starring Amanda Seyfried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UczcO6"&gt;Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17469310/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-biotechnology-health-science"&gt;indicted for fraud in 2018&lt;/a&gt; alongside former Theranos president and COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. Her trial is scheduled to begin in August.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Social media companies, here are some free theme park ideas to comply with Florida’s deplatforming law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jyy04e6kVIm8Wkok7W66nWMfKTY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69358239/VRG_4607_Social_Media_Land.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWpPS8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is deeply invested in doing service journalism; we report on companies’ misdeeds, we review expensive products to tell you whether they’re worth your hard-earned money, and speak to industry leaders to get their insights on the issues affecting their companies and their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeY1a9"&gt;It is in that vein that we brainstormed some ideas for social media theme parks in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIFb0v"&gt;See, the Sunshine State &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451425/florida-social-media-moderation-facebook-twitter-deplatforming"&gt;passed a law this week&lt;/a&gt; that blocks social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter from “knowingly” deplatforming politicians and even algorithmically ranking content, with fine ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per day (The law, which is a mish-mash of broad speech regulations, has already been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;challenged in court&lt;/a&gt; by the tech companies’ trade organizations, which called it “a frontal assault on the First Amendment.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3EIuO"&gt;But there’s an easier way. The law has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;hilariously corrupt exemption&lt;/a&gt; for any company that owns or operates a theme park or large entertainment complex in the state of Florida. Republican state Rep. Blaise Ingoglia said that exemption was included so that the Disney Plus streaming service “isn’t caught up in this.” The Disney World park in Orlando brings in &lt;a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2020/07/09/disney-reopening-slow-step-toward-new-normal"&gt;significant tax revenue&lt;/a&gt; for Florida, of course, a state which relies heavily on tourism dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxTwcW"&gt;So all Twitter, Facebook, TikTok et al have to do to comply with the law and avoid the knotty First Amendment issue of government speech regulations is build their own Floridian theme parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8maKXE"&gt;Here are our suggestions for the parks including some ideas for appropriately themed rides that the venues might offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622212334.352700"&gt;Twitterland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wgt0Z3"&gt;Has a secret nightclub called Slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9OlVHG"&gt;Sells drinks called Canoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6RrZSl"&gt;The Ratio is a dunk tank where you get dropped into water for your bad takes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="htDiXK"&gt;Whac-A-Mole is instead Block-A-Troll &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FmyJ1N"&gt;A water-themed ride where you’re sailing along and random guys try to pull you into the water: Reply Guys, the ride&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="arFkYD"&gt;Rollercoaster goes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/684515262712967170?s=20"&gt;sideways&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QWLqX7"&gt;The only problem with Twitterland is that it keeps opening amazing rides and then letting them completely fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D3yiBL"&gt;Facebook World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vW5oGV"&gt;All the rides suddenly pivot to video without warning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622212441.356000"&gt;A haunted house attraction called Facebook Moderation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nOqeZg"&gt;Instagram and WhatsApp once had separate parks, but they have been annexed into the main Facebook park and turned into shopping malls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="esmcgR"&gt;The water park has a slide into radicalism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xkD4vH"&gt;If you get detained by security, they put you in the Racist Uncle Time Out Room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vyf9im"&gt;An Instagram hall of mirrors that features mirrors that give you an Insta-ready body with lighting made for photos and then leaves you feeling terrible when you come to the last mirror, which has heavy shadows for lighting and no body editing whatsoever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622212517.357100"&gt;TikTokLand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CHLJkK"&gt;A hall of mirrors that shunts you through random rides with absolutely no information or warning, gradually tuning your experience using the sophisticated biometric monitor in your admission wristband&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JOEJyQ"&gt;Alternately, the whole park is just the set from the Weeknd’s Super Bowl halftime show where a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458399/the-backyardigans-viral-tiktok-castaways-music-youtube"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backyardigans&lt;/em&gt; song&lt;/a&gt; plays on a loop &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xqjWIK"&gt;Pinterest Park &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NERDoG"&gt;It’s just a bunch of themed photo booths that produce those little photo strips, but you have to wait in line and read 200 words before you can ride the Recipe Rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HM6oc3"&gt;The GooglePlusPlex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vt32lV"&gt;A giant haunted house which closed eight years ago but high school kids still break into at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMfU3F"&gt;The entire park littered with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;discontinued Google products&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MNTgPi"&gt;Clubhouse Clubhouse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wqwIbM"&gt;It’s just one big infinity room where you enter and hear men talking at you and over each other about Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CQ1J4TN8G-1622212316.352200-thread-list_1622213410.363500"&gt;Reddit Faire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9TvYRT"&gt;A Renaissance fair that ended up sharing its property lease with a prison, thanks to an awkward misunderstanding in the C-suite. Many guests are incredibly devoted cosplayers in delightful historically accurate costumes. Many are petty criminals. A few are serial killers. Try to guess which ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEvviy"&gt;YouTubeLand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="l6Q0E6"&gt;Has a ride where you appear to climb higher and higher forever, but then perilously fall to Earth after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256087/james-charles-youtube-instant-influencer-apology-video-drama-controversy"&gt;botched apology&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2lRyI4"&gt;To enter the park you have to smash the like button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CtCdE7"&gt;The Thumbnail Ride promises nonstop conflict but is really just a pretty chill afternoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PwVRvO"&gt;Every ride is at least 10 minutes long so it can include a midroll break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZI81RR"&gt;If you make a wrong turn at the bathrooms, you’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/8/16751206/elsagate-youtube-kids-creepy-conspiracy-theory"&gt;occasionally run into&lt;/a&gt; an off-brand superhero ride that ends in a spike pit. No one knows who paid for or designed these rides, but children find them inexplicably compelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4FOIlP"&gt;You can’t leave unless you ring a bell, and then you will be sent notifications reminding you to return to YouTubeLand for the rest of your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZySsa5"&gt;Really big and expensive and in many ways the gold standard for all the other parks, but no one appears to be in charge at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4yfzHl"&gt;Snapchat Studios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wgi5zU"&gt;Rides disappear after you go on them once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bltjTQ"&gt;All the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13584488/snapchat-snap-inc-spectacles-vending-machine-snapbot-available"&gt;vending machines sell Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;, but no one buys them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0s9m6c"&gt;Unfortunately the park’s been kind of struggling because all its best rides get cloned by Facebook World within six months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sedEd3"&gt;Temporarily closed because it accidentally opened another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296713/snapchat-juneteenth-filter-smile-chains-controversial"&gt;racist&lt;/a&gt; ride&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Why on Earth did Amazon spend $8 billion on a zombie studio? </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFgIrJ"&gt;Amazon just dumped an $8 billion-plus chunk of change on MGM, a studio best known for James Bond and its logo of a roaring lion. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; offers an opportunity for Amazon to spin the spy films into a big perk for its streaming services. But it’s hard to believe that dropping billions for the studio’s content library is actually going to prop up Amazon’s streaming services — at least on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BQVX4"&gt;Amazon already has a fully functioning &lt;a href="https://studios.amazon.com/"&gt;studio arm&lt;/a&gt; that produces content for its Prime Video service. While it’s got a few hits here and there — &lt;em&gt;Jack Ryan&lt;/em&gt; immediately comes to mind — Amazon has, for the most part, struggled to reach the &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;-level of viewer enthusiasm that its rivals often enjoy. The company also owns IMDb TV, a free and ad-supported streaming service that’s actually pretty decent. Some of the service’s content is a little dated, but most of the curation feels fairly solid as far as pay-nothing title selections go. Still, Amazon could use a considerable content overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x6YhD6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s going to seem like an idiot move in about five years.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gWvZdW"&gt;MGM brings a significant haul of quality cinema to the table, even if much of it is older. The studio’s library includes the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Legally Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rocky&lt;/em&gt; franchises, which isn’t nothing. It also owns a huge back catalog of series and films that include &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Addams Family &lt;/em&gt;animated film, &lt;em&gt;Candyman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Creed&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon said it plans to “reimagine” these titles, which sounds like spinoffs and remakes. “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP,” Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5fSyT"&gt;But while, yes, there’s IP, it’s unclear how valuable it all really is. Many of MGM’s largest franchise properties are dated, and it &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/amazon-buy-mgm-studio-james-bond-shark-tank-77914593#:~:text=Long%20up%20for%20sale%2C%20MGM's,ultimate%20control%20over%20the%20franchise."&gt;doesn’t even fully own&lt;/a&gt; the rights to &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt;, its crown jewel. Plus, many of MGM’s legacy titles like &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wizard of Oz&lt;/em&gt;, for example, aren’t owned by the studio anymore. (Warner Bros. actually now &lt;a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/wizard-oz"&gt;owns the rights&lt;/a&gt; to the iconic film.) MGM, while certainly iconic, is far from a top-tier studio churning out genre-bending contemporary films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UfGCd"&gt;“It feels like they’re following a playbook from five years ago,” Katharine Trendacosta, associate director of policy and activism at Electronic Frontier Foundation, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by phone. Of the $8 billion price tag, Trendacosta said, “it’s going to seem like an idiot move in about five years — because that’s not actually what the value of any of this stuff is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLUOvL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhUkGe"&gt;That IP playbook — the one that landed HBO in its current brand identity crisis under AT&amp;amp;T’s direction — has left scraps as far as studios go. The playbook Amazon and other services are pulling from seems to simply point to snapping up as much content as possible for their respective services. But Amazon, and other service-oriented companies for that matter, are now picking over bones. The company can certainly afford to drop billions on IP acquisitions for its services. But at this point, nobody can compete with what Disney’s been building for the better part of two decades. And as Trendacosta pointed out, “we’re rapidly running out of studios.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="qgabm4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every entertainment [property] is now a streaming service, which means they think of themselves as tech companies — which is incorrect.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2jufsF"&gt;Nearly a decade ago, Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3577656/disney-buys-lucasfilm-plans-to-release-star-wars-episode-7-in-2015"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; Lucasfilm — the studio behind the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; films — for just over $4 billion. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/business/media/01disney.html"&gt;few years prior&lt;/a&gt; to the Lucasfilm deal, the company paid about the same to snap up Marvel. In 2006, the company paid a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/business/disney-to-buy-pixar-for-74-billion.html"&gt;little over $7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to acquire Pixar. Sure, none of these deals were conducted amid what is arguably the peak of streaming’s popularity. But even accounting for the streaming bubble we’re currently in and the value of franchise IP for luring potential subscribers, the MGM deal still feels a little like a ripoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi659x"&gt;“Hollywood has picked up Silicon Valley disease, even though by this point, we should know that doesn’t work,” Trendacosta said. “Every entertainment [property] is now a streaming service, which means they think of themselves as tech companies — which is incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMnmY"&gt;Trendacosta added that these services are all acting on a four-step business model: acquire IP, make as many things as possible, insert question mark here, and reach profitability. But that works only in the instance that the grand plan is to be acquired. For smaller services like Discovery Plus or even Peacock, that makes sense. There are simply far too many streaming services. Those little services won’t be able to compete with the bigger players forever, and we’re likely to see more mergers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;the one we just saw&lt;/a&gt; with WarnerMedia and Discovery. But what comes next is unclear, particularly for mega-services. Right now, it very much feels like mega-services are just collecting spare parts, and that’s to say nothing of brand identity confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3yZgc"&gt;“Who’s going to buy any of these places? No one. They’re already large,” Trendacosta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKw8Gm"&gt;Now, that’s not to say that there’s no value at all in the deal. Amazon can certainly bank on opportunities to spin out any of the legacy franchises it acquired — much in the same way that rival services do to boost subscriber growth. Disney has done this with &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; on Disney Plus, and CBS has done the same with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt; on Paramount Plus (formerly CBS All Access). But &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; value do those spinoffs add for Amazon? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Oc7r"&gt;“You’re talking about overreaching and overpaying, which Amazon can do,” Jeff Bock, senior media analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations Co., told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview by phone. “It doesn’t really hurt their bottom line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4XwI3R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re talking about overreaching and overpaying, which Amazon can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AXZkdL"&gt;By Bock’s estimation, such a move to acquire the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; IP, for example, could be a vertical integration play should Amazon eventually decide to invest in theaters — something that probably sounds ludicrous before you remember that Amazon owns Whole Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDfRHk"&gt;“Is it possible — and everybody here at least in LA thinks so — that they may be one of the bidders on the ArcLight Cinemas or Cinerama Dome?” Bock added. “If they see bookstores in the same way and they see grocery marts in the same way, what’s to stop them from going brick and mortar and buying theaters, eventually, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFXCVP"&gt;That may be especially true of the future of the &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; franchise. Whereas MGM was putting out a &lt;em&gt;Bond&lt;/em&gt; film every few years, Amazon could begin to churn them out every one or two years, Bock speculated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yiHySw"&gt;Ultimately, it’s too soon to say for certain what Amazon plans to do with its shiny new box of legacy classics. It’s entirely possible Amazon will release any forthcoming titles exclusively on Amazon, opt for theatrical releases, or do some combination of both. But whether its $8 billion investment will prove valuable is very much yet to be seen. And on its own, it’s hard to believe that the MGM acquisition will make Prime Video a serious Netflix competitor in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
