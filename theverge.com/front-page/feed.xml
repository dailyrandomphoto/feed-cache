    <title>Instacart adds faster ‘Priority Delivery’ which is sure to cause headaches for delivery workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Veq3veLI3hoW8idIbnGnopaLqN8=/181x0:2149x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352298/Priority_Delivery.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPXqm0"&gt;In the crowded food- and grocery-delivery space, Instacart is hoping that shaving off a few minutes makes all the difference. To that end, it’s creating a new “priority delivery” option that debuts today in select markets and promises to have orders fulfilled in “as fast as 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNL11G"&gt;While 45- and 60-minute deliveries are already available to many Instacart customers, “priority delivery” is, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Fcompany%2Fpressreleases%2Finstacart-launches-priority-delivery-introduces-30-minute-grocery-delivery%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F27%2F22456907%2Finstacart-priority-delivery-faster-orders-new-feature" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, debuting in more than 15 cities (though it only names six: Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle). It’s intended use case is for quick errands, rather than the bulk, groceries-for-the-week function Instacart tends to thrive on. With that in mind, even in participating stores, the 30-minute option will become unavailable for orders that are overly large or complicated, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IO5e5"&gt;As is true for many delivery jobs, small orders, like the ones “priority” is designed for, are typically the least lucrative and often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"&gt;remain in the queue&lt;/a&gt; of unclaimed work for longer. For many drivers, picking up these small potatoes orders aren’t worth the gas they’d spend getting to the store. Naturally, faster service will also cost more — though the pricing for “priority” is as yet unknown. Instacart declined to provide details on how much the upcharge is expected to be, or how much of it will make its way into delivery workers’ paychecks. Instacart also did not say whether it was increasing staffing or making workflow changes to accommodate any needs specific to “priority delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSFiWD"&gt;It’s reasonable to be wary of how this new feature, with its even more strenuous time demands, might impact an already strained and vulnerable workforce. This is, after all, the same company that was found to be subsidizing workers’ wages with their own tip money; it’s also the company that, to some degree, still allows customers to engage in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281910/instacart-tip-baiting-changes-congress-inquiry-exploitation-covid-19"&gt;the abhorrent practice of tip baiting&lt;/a&gt;, whereby delivery workers are enticed to grab an order with a generous tip, only to have it rescinded after the order is completed. This is to say nothing of Instacart’s feelings about workers getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242676/instacart-firing-every-union-employee-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;employee status or collective bargaining rights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYBn3s"&gt;Completing a delivery within half an hour may not seem like a huge strain, especially for Instacart shoppers already working in metros with 45-minute turnarounds. But in the precarity of gig work, customer ratings can mean the difference between having a job or &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-12-21/instacart-shoppers-ratings-returns-missing-orders"&gt;being deactivated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wpPO1x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10521953"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI6c1H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charlie bit us all, if you really think about it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/whoxR9QY6LzgleufS_tYG6k74xg=/95x0:1342x831/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352131/charlie_bit_me.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You played us all, Charlie | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HDCYT" target="_blank"&gt;Image: HDCYT on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rL4ndP"&gt;It’s hard to describe the absolute chaos around NFTs (non-fungible tokens) right now; tech reporters’ inboxes are flooded with the latest and stupidest additions to this trend of digital certificates for memes and other pieces of digital memorabilia. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410070/disaster-girl-popular-meme-nft-500000-dollars"&gt;Disaster Girl&lt;/a&gt; sold for around $500,000, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22322131/nyan-cat-creator-nft-memes-memeconomy"&gt;Keyboard Cat&lt;/a&gt; went for about $64,400, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt; brought in around $590,000. But most NFTs aren’t all that noteworthy, and we can’t possibly write about every single one (despite this sentence, my inbox will now be flooded with NFT pitches for the next two months). But despite our attempts to be judicious and write about newsworthy topics, we can’t win them all.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvJB8T"&gt;We wrote about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22437088/charlie-bit-my-finger-video-nft-deletion-youtube-auction"&gt;Charlie Bit Me NFT auction&lt;/a&gt; because it had a twist the others did not: the seller said it would be leaving the internet “forever,” deleted from YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM"&gt;where it currently has more than 880 million views&lt;/a&gt; once the auction ended. But &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2014092/charlie-bit-me-wont-be-leaving-youtube-after-all-father-says/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there’s another surprise twist: Howard Davies-Carr, the father of the children in the 14-year-old clip, which sold for about $761,000, says it will stay on YouTube after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XSf1k2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OBlgSz8sSM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WYCMfX"&gt;“After the auction we connected with the buyer, who ended up deciding to keep the video on YouTube,” Davies-Carr told &lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;. “The buyer felt that the video is an important part of popular culture and shouldn’t be taken down. It will now live on YouTube for the masses to continue enjoying as well as memorialized as an NFT on the blockchain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMftyN"&gt;I guess that’s nice and all but if you didn’t want to abide by the rules you could have simply— not bid on it in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="GPiGei"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HPS2fz"&gt;Okay so, listen, internet. We try to accept that things change and opinions shift and nothing is forever, but we have to lay down some rules about NFTs, in my humble Gen X opinion. Charlie and his brother are really cute (or were in 2007), but this isn’t even one of the most clever or interesting memes on the internet if we’re being brutally honest. Spend your money on whatever you like, but if the seller says the meme will be gone forever to attract buyers and eyeballs, they’re setting certain expectations, and when you change the rules last minute it leads to chaos and confusion and grumpy editors.  Not to mention the confusion you’re creating among buyers. Now instead of one Charlie, you’ve increased the supply to infinite Charlies — something the other prospective buyers might have liked to know before they decided to bid.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUtSUL"&gt;I guess it’s not all that surprising that a blockchain-related product might overpromise and then under-deliver, but I’m fairly certain this last-minute switcheroo will just encourage ever more ridiculous stunts for people to get coverage and buyers for their NFTs. Which will probably result in less coverage in tech media because no one wants to get burned — or in this case, bitten — by a story that doesn’t live up to the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGWzNs"&gt;Charlie, good going, my young friend. In the end, you bit us all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s WF-1000XM4s wireless earbuds leak again with all-new water resistance and ‘V1’ chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyySQ7W2HL4FMwGlEMd_Lk9ac_Y=/44x0:617x382/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69352021/Sony_WF_1000XM4_1622109809_1_12.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What appears to be an official photo of the Sony WF-1000XM4s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,123155.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GJPyDl"&gt;We heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428676/sony-1000xm4-earbuds-leak"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that Sony may be planning to launch its next noise-canceling true wireless earbuds, the WF-1000XM4s, as early as June, and thanks to new leaks &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123155.html"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we might now know almost all of the specs for the upcoming buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMArDx"&gt;Like the very good &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;previous-gen WF-1000XM3s&lt;/a&gt;, the new WF-1000XM4s will offer active noise cancelation (ANC), but thanks to a new “Sony V1” processor, ANC performance will be improved, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports. The headphones will also support Sony’s LDAC codec, which lets you listen to high-quality audio over Bluetooth, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dsyqsf"&gt;And it sounds like the new 1000XM4s will have a very good battery life, like the 1000XM3s. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says you’ll be able to get eight hours of battery on a single charge with ANC on and 12 hours with ANC off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHJJ8n"&gt;Additionally, the 1000XM4s have an IPX4-rating for water and sweat resistance, according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture. &lt;/em&gt;That would be a nice improvement over the WF-1000XM3s, which weren’t certified for water resistance at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbqPVL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also shared many official-looking renders of the 1000XM4s, which look to match &lt;a href="https://thewalkmanblog.blogspot.com/2021/05/sony-wf-1000xm4-full-design-leaked.html?m=1"&gt;previously shared&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445281/sony-wf-1000xm4-true-wireless-earbuds-leak-images-specs-details-rumors"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of an all-new design. I’ve collected a few of the renders in the gallery below, but you should check out &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123155.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture’s&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; to see a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZeZkR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10521987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iB5j3N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says the 1000XM4s will go on sale in Europe soon for €279.90, but it didn’t give a US price. The 1000XM3s launched in the US at $229.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5Ei5Nk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Leaked renders give the best look yet at Sony’s next wireless earbuds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445281/sony-wf-1000xm4-true-wireless-earbuds-leak-images-specs-details-rumors"},{"title":"Leak of Sony’s upcoming 1000XM4 earbuds reveals all-new design","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428676/sony-1000xm4-earbuds-leak"},{"title":"This leak shows that Sony’s noise-canceling earbuds could fit in your ears better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295503/sony-wireless-earbud-wf-1000xm4-possible-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Kellogg’s is introducing a cereal robot to make the easiest food to prepare even easier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lo0Qx_8u2Szr-FF1doaQeTskQ_U=/70x22:613x384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351985/UW_Madison.60ae3bc77d0ef.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Kellog’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f0l1xs"&gt;Kellogg’s — legal guardian of such cereal mascots as Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam — &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/kelloggsawayfromhome/videos/introducing-the-kelloggs-bowl-bot/4176505945748995/"&gt;has partnered&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272746/doordash-chowbotics-acquisition-salad-robot"&gt;DoorDash-owned Chowbotics&lt;/a&gt; to launch a new cereal-mixing robot at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Florida State University (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/kelloggs-introduces-robotic-vending-machines-that-mix-a-1846981993"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Kellogg’s Bowl Bot offers a vending machine-type experience for one of the simplest breakfast foods, and charges anywhere from $2.99 to $6.50 for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAYxGj"&gt;The Bowl Bot could be best thought of as an extension of Chowbotics’ earlier &lt;a href="https://www.chowbotics.com/our-solutions/"&gt;“Sally” fresh food and salad robot&lt;/a&gt;. You interact with it via a touchscreen to select through your dairy bases (milk or yogurt), combinations of cereals and granolas, and toppings like fresh fruit or cocoa nibs. Kellogg’s also offers custom pre-designed combinations of cereals at a higher price if something like the “Hawaii 5-0” (Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bear Naked Fit Triple Berry Granola, pineapple, coconut, and mango) sounds better than what you can come up with on your own. While Bowl Bot seems to offer plenty of options, there’s some more human preferences it might not account for, like adding less milk to avoid soggy cereal. We’ve reached out to Kellogg’s to see how customizable the Bowl Bot actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RnHM5"&gt;Applying the &lt;a href="https://www.coca-colafreestyle.com/"&gt;Coca-Cola Freestyle&lt;/a&gt; soda machine experience to cereal makes some amount of sense. It takes up less space than a cereal bar and theoretically eliminates the need for individual boxes and walk-ins full of milk. It does also seem like a way to further nickel-and-dime students through a kind of “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/30/5857030/keurig-digital-rights-management-coffee-pod-pirates"&gt;food DRM&lt;/a&gt;.” Each college will handle its meal plans differently, but I’d be pretty annoyed if my unlimited cereal-for-dinner lifestyle got saddled with $3-per-bowl microtransactions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this investigation into the real death toll from the Texas freeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deep Freeze Power Crisis In Texas Is Expanding" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DkoxXRkf8Pd5bckqDG0By78-RQo=/0x0:4713x3142/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351590/1231215587.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A truck drives down the street during a power outage in McKinney, Texas, U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021. Blackouts left almost 5 million customers without electricity that day, while refineries and oil wells were shut during unprecedented freezing weather.  | Cooper Neill/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="roPfOW"&gt;Hundreds more people died in Texas during the February deep freeze and blackouts than the state’s official count shows, according to an investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/texas-winter-storm-power-outage-death-toll"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The outages left millions of people without power as indoor temperatures dropped to deadly lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wIry0T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The way authorities typically count death tolls from disasters tends to drastically low-ball the actual losses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNvsw7"&gt;Texas has so far acknowledged &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news/updates.shtm#wn"&gt;151&lt;/a&gt; winter storm-related deaths. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, found that an estimated 700 people lost their lives from the combined catastrophes of the storm and power outages. The news outlet conducted a thorough analysis of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;data that showed how many more people died around that time than would normally be expected. It’s the most recent analysis to show that the way authorities typically count death tolls from disasters tends to drastically low-ball the actual losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="om64e7"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;, the Texas Department of State Health Services counted mostly deaths from hypothermia, accidents involving ice, and &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/04/29/texas-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/"&gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt; (people turned on cars and grills inside their homes in desperate attempts to stay warm). But hypothermia is “notoriously difficult to diagnose,” Hannah Jarvis, assistant medical examiner at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;. And the deaths of people who were already vulnerable to extreme cold and stress because of underlying medical conditions flew under the radar of Texas officials, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4OBbi"&gt;Many of their death records point to those conditions, like cardiovascular disease or diabetes, as the cause of death. But family members and roommates who were there for their loved ones’ last, shivering moments say the freezing cold was to blame. “I still believe the cold made him to where his heart just gave out,” one grieving widow, Mary Gonzales, tells &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQv8cx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt; modeled how many deaths are expected in a given week, using long-term and seasonal trends. Then it compared that to actual deaths recorded by the CDC to find out how many more people likely died because of the storm and blackouts (and subtracted deaths from COVID-19). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIScL8"&gt;Similar studies revealed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;how many people really died during Hurricane Maria and the blackouts that followed. Puerto Rico changed its official death count from 64 to 2,975 following public outrage over its initial underestimate and after a more in-depth &lt;a href="http://prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/prstudy.publichealth.gwu.edu/files/reports/Acertainment%20of%20the%20Estimated%20Excess%20Mortality%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria%20in%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by George Washington University arrived at the higher number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OLywEG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This story is about more than numbers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QvxzwF"&gt;“We now know that the Texas government’s repeated failure to modernize our energy systems killed over 700 Texans in February’s winter storm,” former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1397756534332002306"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, calling for more action from lawmakers to harden the state’s energy system from climate change and more extreme weather. Many energy companies chose not to steel the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;state’s energy infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; against bouts of cold weather, even after a similarly brutal 2011 cold snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0FOyV"&gt;In the end, this story is about more than numbers. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; talked to families who are still fighting for justice after losing those they loved. Many were unable to qualify for support from FEMA because their death certificates didn’t mention the winter storm. Failing to officially acknowledge their deaths also puts lives at risk in future disasters, because public health officials aren’t able to see all the vulnerabilities that played out during the storm. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; shows what the state missed; read the &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/texas-winter-storm-power-outage-death-toll"&gt;full story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is free on the Epic Games Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OxdI77U9VfQGs2zBNK0pl85gmZk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351252/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i75zcs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, the multiplayer game that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;soared in popularity&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic, is the latest free title on the Epic Games Store. If you have an account for that storefront, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/among-us"&gt;you can download it for free until June 3rd&lt;/a&gt; (it normally costs $5). You can then join friends in the game’s newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362177/among-us-airship-update-map-sneaky-crewmate-imposter"&gt;Airship map&lt;/a&gt;, and good news: those friends don’t all need to be playing on PC. The game supports cross-platform multiplayer, so players of the Android, iOS, PC, and Nintendo Switch versions can play together. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;The PS4 and PS5 versions&lt;/a&gt; of the game will support crossplay, too, once it launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

A new mystery game will be free each week, so once &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ time is up on Thursday, June 3rd, another game will become available. &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt; was the previous free game during the sale event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonic Colors is getting remastered as Sega announces a handful of new Sonic games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WEk8VV3wqgSMu4blAlE2VWPGzmI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351167/On_the_Go.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic Colors Ultimate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DH1god"&gt;One of the most beloved &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; games is making a return. Sega announced today that a remaster of &lt;em&gt;Sonic Colors&lt;/em&gt; — called &lt;em&gt;Sonic Colors: Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; — will be coming to the PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EghANq"&gt;The platformer originally launched in 2010, garnering a cult following, and Sega says the new version will feature “stunning visuals, additional features, a new mode, and improved gameplay enhancements.” The game will also be getting a two-part animated tie-in called &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Wisps&lt;/em&gt;. The first episode will be out later in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LHESNG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sonic Colors: Ultimate arrives September 7th, 2021! &lt;a href="https://t.co/ea3G4FQZGn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ea3G4FQZGn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sonic the Hedgehog (@sonic_hedgehog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1397949584366702595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2o6yjz"&gt;The announcement was the headlining piece of a &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt;-focused event, which included the reveal of several other games. Sega also announced that the next flagship &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; title is in the works from Sonic Team — though no real details are available yet, aside from a 2022 release window — as well as a new collection of classic games called &lt;em&gt;Sonic Origins&lt;/em&gt;, which will compile the first three games along with &lt;em&gt;Sonic CD&lt;/em&gt;. Oh, and the animated Netflix series has a name: &lt;em&gt;Sonic Prime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghZTMg"&gt;Elsewhere, existing games are jumping to new platforms: &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Team Sonic Racing &lt;/em&gt;just launched on Amazon’s Luna cloud service; both of those games and &lt;em&gt;Sonic Forces&lt;/em&gt; will be on PlayStation Now on June 1st; and &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt; will be available through the Epic Games Store on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is coming to the US in June for $159</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1JISuqcECuN8zMsRp7Dora2I_Q=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69351058/Galaxy_Tab_S7_FE_PR_main3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oGaSYT"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-the-newest-members-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-portfolio-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-and-galaxy-tab-a7-lite"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356129/samsung-tab-a7-lite-tablet-leak-camera-specs-display-s7"&gt;long-rumored tablets&lt;/a&gt;: the Galaxy Tab S7 FE and the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite. The company is yet to confirm US pricing or availability for the Tab S7 FE, but in the UK, the tablet will cost £589 or £629 depending on whether you opt for 64GB or 128GB of storage, and it’ll release on June 18th. Meanwhile, the Tab A7 Lite is a smaller, more affordable model. It starts at $159 in the US where it will release on June 10th. (In the UK, it starts at £149 and will release on June 18th.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1LMvn"&gt;There’s not a lot we don’t know about the Galaxy Tab S7 FE since most of its specs were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451398/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-fe-germany-no-oled"&gt;revealed earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; by its German product page. It’s got a large 12.4-inch 2560 x 1600 LCD display, an 8-megapixel camera on the rear, and a 5-megapixel camera on the front. A neat bonus is that it comes with one of Samsung’s S Pen styluses in the box for note-taking and sketching purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/05Bi2TKyuPkFt2fv4OQO5iX4k8Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22543387/Galaxy_Tab_S7_FE_PR_main2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y8ljB6"&gt;Samsung’s press release doesn’t say exactly what processor is powering the Tab S7 FE beyond saying it’s an octa-core model, but it’s previously been reported to &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,123088.html"&gt;have a Snapdragon 750G&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got a 10,090mAh battery that can be fast-charged at up to 45W, and there’s the choice of 4 or 6GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of internal storage (expandable by up to 1TB by microSD). There are Wi-Fi-only, LTE, and 5G models available, and the Tab S7 FE is available in black, silver, green, and pink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nIQy3"&gt;Meanwhile, the more affordable Galaxy Tab A7 Lite drops the screen size to just 8.7 inches and the resolution to 1340 x 800. There’s still an 8-megapixel camera on the rear, but the selfie camera is just 2 megapixels. Previous reports have pegged its processor &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A7-Lite-specs-sheet-surfaces-online.537570.0.html"&gt;as a MediaTek MT8768&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s paired with a 5,100mAh battery and either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There are Wi-Fi-only and LTE models available, and color options include gray and silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1xPqV"&gt;Both of these Android 11 tablets are designed as more affordable counterparts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;last year’s Tab S7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Tab A7&lt;/a&gt;, so their modest specs shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise. If last year’s tablets are anything to go by, that should make them a pair of decent devices for media consumption, even if they’re not going to trade blows with a device like the iPad Pro when it comes to productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb tries to cancel Hot Vax Summer by extending party ban until the fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bB_LbZphCLPczO2jYXx4olRIA2A=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350735/Airbnb_Logo_Over_Gradient.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RiYDkw"&gt;Hot Vax Summer is fast approaching: vaccination rates are rising, and many people are ready to get out there and party hard — except Airbnb. It’s &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-extension-of-party-ban-through-end-of-summer/"&gt;extending its global partying ban&lt;/a&gt; through the summer as it tries to “cultivate safe and responsible travel through our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzSRU6"&gt;The company notes in the announcement of the extension that the global ban on parties has already “proven to be popular with our Host community,” noting that most Airbnb hosts had banned hosting raucous parties by choice in their own listing rules prior to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377408/airbnb-global-ban-house-parties-coronavirus"&gt;platform-wide ban last August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZ1C5F"&gt;Airbnb points out that the party ban was already an indefinite one, so the announcement today is less of an extension and more of a clarification for customers who were asking whether it would be lifted in time to throw an epic rager over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyyY0q"&gt;The extended ban isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379885/airbnb-summer-responsible-travel-community-support-fno-parties-pandemic"&gt;the first move&lt;/a&gt; Airbnb has made to throw some cold water on post-pandemic partying: in April, the company announced its &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-launches-summer-of-responsible-travel/"&gt;“Summer of Responsible Travel”&lt;/a&gt; plan, banning one-night and last-minute trips on the Fourth of July weekend for guests without a history of positive Airbnb reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs6UWQ"&gt;The company also previously offered hosts discounted Airbnb noise detection devices to let them more easily monitor raucous guests and offer its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fneighbors&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Neighborhood Support Line&lt;/a&gt; to allow neighbors to file party complaints directly with the company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save up to $150 on Beats noise-canceling wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AzAAE6yJs9pv66GeLek_ZhKcPng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69350477/cwelch_191024_3759_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7YEna"&gt;Amazon’s Prime Day for 2021 may happen on June 21st and 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Last year’s Prime member-exclusive shopping holiday was delayed until October due to the pandemic. In years prior, Amazon had hosted Prime Day in the summer. But with June upon us, this could mean one of the best times to buy tech, games, movies, and more could be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2fyfh"&gt;We’ll have that covered end-to-end with all of the best deals. But here are the tech deals you need to know about today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="REz9N9"&gt;
&lt;p id="4Y0XpS"&gt;A couple of Beats headphone models with noise cancellation are seeing big discounts today. Firstly, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YVYNM3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo Pro at Amazon are down to $150&lt;/a&gt; (originally $300), and notably, this sale price is for the black, gray, and ivory colorways that aren’t frequently looped into big price cuts. These are on-ear headphones with Apple’s H1 wireless chip that allows hands-free “Hey Siri” commands. The black model is currently backordered until June 10th at Amazon, but other colors are in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nAx7jx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10436511"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AG4vGY"&gt;If you want all-encompassing sound, the Beats Studio 3 might be a better choice because of their over-ear design. Originally $350, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1741737748299677012#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085296FLT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are selling the shadow gray and matte black colorways for $220. Like the newer Solo Pro, these offer noise cancellation, and its ear cups can fold inward to make them easier to stow in a bag. The Studio 3 are older than the Solo Pro (they were released in 2017), and they have Apple’s older W1 wireless chip. They’ll still quickly pair with Apple devices, but these don’t offer hands-free Siri commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yMnzzq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521384"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RaRuum"&gt;Sony is hosting a Days of Play sale that includes some of the &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/518b9425-a874-447f-b286-002ceca36cbf/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first big price cuts on digital PS5 games as well as many PS4 titles&lt;/a&gt; that will see visual upgrades when running on PS5. If you’d rather have discs instead of downloading games, you can find discounts on many of these games at other retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irxtCx"&gt;Before I get into calling out some favorites, I want to note that digital storefront Eneba is offering a deal on $50 PlayStation gift cards that you can use to purchase games, DLC, and more from the PS Store. Once you &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals052821&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-50-usa-psn-key-united-states%2Fjetpak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;add this gift card to your cart&lt;/a&gt;, enter the code &lt;strong&gt;DAYSOF50PROMO &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to see the price drop down to $43.49 (or lower).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVMBks"&gt;Now, for a few games that are on sale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pyHayh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ru5do2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="2XIfqK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wS9LVq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568461"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQQXcH"&gt;If you’re making plans to head outdoors for a camping trip, BioLite’s CampStove 2 Plus seems like a smart purchase for both staying warm and keeping your phone charged. It’s a portable stove that can provide 3W of electricity to its built-in 3,200mAh battery when a fire is going. Usually $150, it’s down to $113 until May 31st, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QDVlGK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10521431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2PiTn"&gt;Lastly, you can get $50 off the usual going price for Google’s 10-inch Nest Hub Max that has a built-in camera for video calls via Zoom or Google Meet. &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00426us.html&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama is offering this deal&lt;/a&gt;, and you can get it yourself by adding the smart display to your cart, then use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRA50OFF &lt;/strong&gt;to bring the price down to $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2OaXbK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="SEImcy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
