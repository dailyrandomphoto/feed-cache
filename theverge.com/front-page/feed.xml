    <title>Samsung won’t physically attend Mobile World Congress 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZLp3y9"&gt;Samsung representatives won’t show up in person to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-will-attend-barcelonas-world-mobile-congress-remotely-la-vanguardia-2021-05-11/"&gt;a statement obtained by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it has “made the decision to withdraw from exhibiting in-person” and will instead attend remotely to prioritize the health and safety of its customers and employees. Samsung has yet to announce what its remote presence will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMKwuD"&gt;The in-person event is still scheduled to happen in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and difficulties with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421558/us-covid-coronavirus-vaccines-patent-waiver"&gt;vaccination availability outside the US&lt;/a&gt;. The GSM Association, which organizes the event, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123846/mobile-world-congress-gsma-coronavirus-lg"&gt;fought against shutting down last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; early on in 2020 before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;several big brands dropped out&lt;/a&gt;. This year, we’ve already seen Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360692/google-mwc-mobile-world-congress-phone-2021-nokia-ericsson"&gt;announce that it won’t be exhibiting&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to Samsung’s remote announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2zZY"&gt;We’ve reached out to several other large brands about their attendance plans, including ZTE, Huawei, Sony, and Lenovo. None were immediately available for comment, but we’ll update this article if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is reportedly pulling a Facebook and adding in-app shopping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ly8oGOnMH-fhcstTfoE89EJxeo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269572/acastro_190402_3308_Guide_TikTok_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aogItH"&gt;TikTok’s next move to compete with Facebook might be to add an in-app shopping feature, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication writes that TikTok is testing in-app sales in Europe by partnering with several brands, including UK-based streetwear company Hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkbyNY"&gt;TikTok’s made some shopping moves in the past, like giving creators the ability to sell merchandise through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408539/tiktok-teespring-merchandise-apparel-commerce-monetization"&gt;an integration with Teespring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://news.shopify.com/dancing-to-a-new-beat-shopify-brings-commerce-to-tiktok"&gt;partnering with Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, and reportedly working on some kind of &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-live-stream-shopping-feature-in-app-purchases-2021-2"&gt;live-video informercial product&lt;/a&gt;. This new prototype sounds more like how shopping’s been integrated on Instagram, with a separate shopping tab under a brand’s account that lists products with images and prices, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Il4KSZfDn9ZqgVML4J7IWWAc1ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506865/TikTok_Shopping.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hype account page on TikTok shows what looks like a shopping tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="engzTb"&gt;The Hype account page currently does show what looks like a shopping section (though it’s blank for my US account) and the company did confirm to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that it was participating in the test. We’ve also reached out to TikTok for further confirmation the shopping test is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIBFv"&gt;Shopping and TikTok seem like they could have a real peanut butter and jelly type of relationship. The bite-sized length and “stickiness” of TikTok videos seem perfectly suited for advertising, while the passive watching that TikTok encourages (at least in me) makes it easy to consume a lot of content. So far, this shopping prototype doesn’t sound quite as video-focused as whatever informercial-style feature TikTok was previously considering, but I wouldn’t be too surprised to see links to the hypothetical shopping tab littered throughout a brand or creator’s videos at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx7LMd"&gt;It’s also more or less exactly what Facebook’s on its way to doing with Instagram, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165957/instagram-reels-shopping-update-global"&gt;TikTok competitor Reels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399858/facebook-shop-app-update-sell-product-instagram"&gt;the normal Facebook app&lt;/a&gt; itself. The company went on a slightly different kind of shopping spree in 2020, adding commerce functionality like the previously mentioned shopping tab, product information in Reels, and it hasn’t stopped there. Facebook is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323398/facebook-stories-ads-stickers-creator-monetize-update"&gt;testing sticker ads&lt;/a&gt; in Stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqf6jE"&gt;Wherever TikTok lands with shopping, tests like these seem to show the viral video app is ready to take advantage of its status as a household name and grow — whether it’s shopping or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22422980/tiktok-log-in-sound-kit-app-integration-developers"&gt;spreading TikTok features across other apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter is the new name of Project CHIP, the partnership that promises to simplify your smart home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epha63qFJ9tZiyXSdZwKbEQHEpg=/249x0:1881x1088/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269556/matter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yym2p2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;Project Connected Home over IP (CHIP)&lt;/a&gt; — the ambitious smart home partnership that will see Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, the Zigbee Alliance, and dozens of other companies work together on an open standard — has gotten a new name: Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCp9iP"&gt;The rebranding comes ahead of the first Matter certifications, which are set to arrive before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387252/project-chip-will-finally-ship-later-this-year"&gt;the end of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The new branding and logo are designed to help make it easier for customers to tell which devices work with Matter’s unified system, with the logo set to appear on future hardware products. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-v7LDftjLpwcTSLmERNUBtqukyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506925/Matter_Smart_Bulb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="03T3RD"&gt;The goal of Matter is deceptively simple: make sure you’re able to use your smart home devices with the voice assistant (or assistants) of choice, whether that’s Apple’s Siri / HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant. At launch, Matter will run on Ethernet Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth Low Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLRZUM"&gt;Other big companies, like Philips Hue, are on board: the company has already promised to release a simple software update in the coming months that will make all of its past and present products compatible with Matter once it launches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2phxrb"&gt;It’s an ambitious goal, which could vastly simplify the confusing parts of smart home setup — assuming companies are willing to put in the work to issue software updates and integrate the standard into their current and future products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Mpwn"&gt;As part of the announcement, the Zigbee Alliance (which created the Zigbee standard for interconnected smart home gadgets) has announced that it’ll rename itself to the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) as it expands to focus more on projects like Matter in addition to the existing Zigbee network.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PRO Act would reshape the tech industry — will it get the chance?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers First Address To Joint Session Of Congress" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5XbyuM3hyRxQPZEZwr8xDu3GD0=/0x0:2934x1956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269537/1232585550.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rb0J2"&gt;The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is holding a hearing this week to contest the results of the Amazon union election. Organizers say the retail giant interrogated employees, spread anti-union propaganda, and held captive audience meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hF1IQ9"&gt;These tactics might seem dirty, but most aren’t explicitly illegal. “According to the letter of the law, workers have the right to organize, but it doesn’t pan out that way in practice,” says Kelly Russo, an organizer with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 2. “Labor laws are weak or have loopholes that allow employers to dissuade people from forming a union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJaNIH"&gt;The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 was meant to defend worker organizing. But the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947 poked holes in many of its protections. The legislation allowed states to pass right-to-work laws, forcing unions to represent workers who don’t pay dues, which weakens their position financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gpSxT"&gt;Now, Congress is considering a law that would dramatically reshape American labor. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act (also known as the PRO Act) would eliminate many of the roadblocks that workers face when they try to unionize. Among other things, it would ban companies from forcing employees to attend captive audience meetings where managers spread anti-union messages; allow unions to collect dues from non-union members — increasing their budgets and their ability to effectively organize; and establish penalties for companies that violate workers’ rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NriN9J"&gt;“The PRO Act is the most significant piece of labor legislation since the New Deal,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings. “It really addresses the ways that workers’ rights to organize have been eroded, which is why we see these huge misinformation campaigns and well-funded propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LGLen"&gt;The bill would have massive implications for tech companies that have faced few consequences for union busting. After the Bessemer election, RWDSU accused Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/union-appeals-amazon-election-in-complaint-claiming-misconduct?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;of firing an organizer for handing out union cards&lt;/a&gt;. This is illegal under current labor law. But even if it were proved true, the punishment for Amazon would be minimal. “There is no repercussion, essentially,” Dubal says. “A worker would have to file an Unfair Labor Practice charge, then they wait for months and months to find out if they were illegally fired. And then the only power that the state has to enforce this is to say, ‘Look, Amazon, you have to reinstate the worker and you have to put a sign up in the break room that says that you broke the law.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BInsfC"&gt;The PRO Act could also impact the Alphabet Workers Union, which launched in early January. The union is open to contractors as well as white collar workers — making NLRB recognition nearly impossible. Under the PRO Act, that might change. The law reshapes the test for determining who is an independent contractor. “It would make it much easier for a lot of people who are misclassified right now as independent contractors to organize,” Dubal says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMR3uY"&gt;It’s for that reason that Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart have spent at least $1,190,000 on lobbying efforts to influence the bill, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/05/06/pro-act-uber-lyft-doordash-instacart-lobbying/"&gt;according to reporting in &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Uber has said that the possibility of drivers unionizing could pose a business risk, writing in its 2020 financial filing: “If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWfBGm"&gt;The PRO Act passed the House on March 9th, 2021. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he’d bring the legislation to the floor for a vote if supporters rallied 50 co-sponsors, &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/pro-act-labor-senate-vote-filibuster/"&gt;according to reporting in &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But right now that’s unlikely to happen. No Republicans are expected to back the bill, and &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/12/pro-act-mark-kelly-angus-king-dsa/"&gt;prominent Democrats like Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) have been reluctant to voice their support&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJhL5c"&gt;So far, only 47 senators have signed on in support of the measure, leaving the bill far short of the 60 “yes” votes necessary for it to overcome a filibuster. Three Democrats, including Kelly, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), have stayed relatively silent on the sweeping labor legislation, and unions have promised not to support the lawmakers in upcoming elections if they fail to back the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/22/unions-senate-democrats-pro-act-484280"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Labor activists have gone as far as showing up at Warner’s home on Wednesday with a cake to lobby for his support for the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/cake-mark-warner-unions/2021/05/05/f794ad28-ad08-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oQw7f"&gt;“‘Send me the PRO Act.’ Support the President,” the cake read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS79ES"&gt;With Republicans largely opposed to the legislation, the PRO Act needs every ounce of support possible from Democrats and Independents in order to send it to the president’s desk. Without 60 lawmakers in favor of the legislation, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/6/17/18681798/filibuster-senate-broke-video"&gt;one senator can prevent the bill&lt;/a&gt; from being brought for a vote by prolonging debate on it. “It’s the legacy of slave power. I have no other way to describe the filibuster than that. We need an abolition of this anti-democratic nonsense that prevents real progress,” says Tom Smith, organizing director of the Communications Workers of America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5CiV3"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Warner said, “I am concerned about the portion of the bill that deals with worker classification. Many Americans prefer alternative work arrangements that give them the freedom and flexibility to set their own hours or work around their other interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLeLG1"&gt;A spokesperson for Kelly told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that he was “evaluating the legislation and speaking about it with stakeholders in Arizona as he focuses on building an economic recovery that benefits working Arizonans who have been hit hard by the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixzO71"&gt;Sinema’s office did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3YELL"&gt;The lack of support from Senate Democrats has been a blow to unions that are hoping the PRO Act will help them regain some of their power. “I think the question for us is ‘are we going to take advantage of this moment or not?’” Smith says. “Are we going to make this another one of those moments in history when tens of millions of workers are able to successfully organize unions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vz0alz"&gt;President Joe Biden has repeatedly touted his support for the PRO Act. In March, he &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/09/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-house-taking-up-the-pro-act/"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the passage of the bill: “As America works to recover from the devastating challenges of deadly pandemic, an economic crisis, and reckoning on race that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZRPbY"&gt;That call was brought up again last month during Biden’s first joint address to Congress. “The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uKxpe"&gt;Organizers hope they’ll get a chance to do so again, noting that the current labor landscape is heavily weighted toward corporations. “The hell scape that workers face when they try to exercise their fundamental human rights, and their freedom of association — it’s just so stacked against them right now,” Smith says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subaru teases its first electric car, the Solterra EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02ZfNYBQlv9wJrmCJ32r7XN1E5w=/1x0:4500x2999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269419/Solterra2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/500px Prime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iKuBbo"&gt;Subaru has released a pair of teaser images of its first electric car, which will be called the Solterra EV. Coming to the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan in 2022, it will be powered by the electric vehicle platform that Subaru has been co-developing with fellow Japanese automaker Toyota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0h67Y"&gt;In true teaser fashion, the images don’t show off too much. One, which appears to be more of a rendering than an actual photograph, reveals that the EV will... roughly look similar to Subaru’s other SUVs, though it seems to be on the smaller side. The other is a close-up of the rear badge, with a subtle splash of mud as a nod toward Subaru’s outdoorsy bona fides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLomWH"&gt;That’s basically all Subaru is saying for now, though. No pricing, no specs, and no information about whether Subaru will use the Solterra as a chance to refresh the way it designs its vehicle interiors (as many other automakers have with their first electric vehicles). Pretty much the only other detail Subaru shared is that the name “was created using the Latin words for ‘Sun’ and ‘Earth’ to represent Subaru’s commitment to deliver traditional SUV capabilities in an environmentally responsible package” — which, as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18200592/driver-assistance-adas-names-aaa-report"&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://schwindter.substack.com/p/semantic-drain-and-the-meaninglessness#:~:text=The%20gradual%20creep%20of%20jargon,of%20just%20a%20few%20years.&amp;amp;text=It's%20not%20the%20word's%20fault."&gt;naming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/12/22380114/kyndryl-ibm-it-spinoff-name-infrastructure-branding"&gt;conventions&lt;/a&gt; go, is kind of refreshingly harmonic, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/04/20/all-electric-subaru-evoltis-with-oddball-design-to-be-unveiled-in-2021/"&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/subaru-of-america-is-being-super-lame-right-now-about-t-1840971831?utm_source=jalopnik_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_jalopnik_twitter"&gt;Subaru&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac52f4"&gt;Solterra is certainly more pleasing to the eyes than “BZ4X,” which is the name of the first SUV Toyota &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;will build on this shared platform with Subaru&lt;/a&gt;. The BZ4X is also due out in 2022 and will be built on this shared platform, which Toyota calls the e-TNGA and Subaru calls e-Subaru (which is not so harmonic). The companies have said that the vehicles built on this platform will benefit from Subaru’s experience with making really good all-wheel drive systems and Toyota’s years of developing battery tech for its hybrids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPzcJB"&gt;As thin as the press release is, being able to talk about Subaru’s first EV never felt like a total given. Along with Toyota, Subaru has avoided making a splashy or expensive transition to electric vehicles during a time when most every other automaker took the leap. The company’s slow approach has, at best, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-show-scant-interest-in-electric-vehicles-subaru-ceo-says-11579520427"&gt;seemed like a sober read of the current market&lt;/a&gt; and, at worst, seemed out of touch — like when it advertised its all-wheel drive technology as a “great opportunity to cope with recent climate change” in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamshack24/status/1201239098482016256/photo/1"&gt;a since-deleted press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox’s Quick Resume feature gets new group option in May update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsbJT3olWFZiQRUImQVbtdygQt8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269385/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oNwJ58"&gt;The Xbox Series X / S’s handy Quick Resume feature, which suspends supported games so that they boot up more quickly when you come back to them later, is getting some nice improvements in the May Xbox update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbvVHo"&gt;Once the update is installed on your console, you’ll be able to see which games are kept in Quick Resume with a new tag, and you’ll also be able to make a group of games in Quick Resume so you have access to all of them in a single spot. Microsoft is also promising that Quick Resume will have “improved reliability and faster load times,” Microsoft’s Jonathan Hildebrandt &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/05/11/may-2021-xbox-update/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Quick Resume group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nYeSMR"&gt;The new update also adds passthrough audio for media apps like Disney Plus and Apple TV, meaning that audio from those apps can be sent directly to a compatible HDMI device. There are also new parental settings that let parents unblock multiplayer mode for individual games and a new dynamic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKT0Zg"&gt;The May update should be rolling out now, and it might already be available for you. While writing this story, I booted up my Series X and it installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFccDl"&gt;Microsoft also announced that it will be sunsetting the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-one-smartglass%2F9wzdncrfhvx2%3Frtc%3D1%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox One SmartGlass app for PC&lt;/a&gt; starting in June. “This means the SmartGlass app will be removed from the Windows Store and there will be no further updates for those who have the app already downloaded to their devices,” Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exceptional growth is the ‘new normal’ for solar and wind energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Onshore wind turbines and electricity transmission pylons at the Little Cheyne Court Wind Farm near Camber, U.K., on Monday, Oct. 26, 2020.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TAlCUKEGc22W7CrekVKPo3nSj7s=/0x0:3901x2601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269222/1229321378.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Onshore wind turbines and electricity transmission pylons at the Little Cheyne Court Wind Farm near Camber, UK, on October 26th, 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LmNYuP"&gt;Solar and wind energy growth soared in 2020 and is on course to keep catapulting upward. Last year, renewable sources of electricity grew faster than they have since 1999. That rapid rise is far from a one-off event, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which said today that the “exceptionally high” growth in 2020 is the “new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FYKYSS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy is elbowing out competition from fossil fuels&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R1PXq5"&gt;It’s yet another signal that renewable energy is elbowing out competition from fossil fuels, at least when it comes to electricity. New renewable energy capacity — primarily solar and wind — made up a whopping 90 percent of the power sector’s growth globally last year, according to the IEA, an intergovernmental organization that was founded to monitor the world’s oil supply but now also tracks renewable energy. The agency forecasts renewables to again account for 90 percent of the power sector’s expansion in 2021 and 2022.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBlPta"&gt;That transition to renewable energy for electricity falls in line with many countries’ goals on climate change. President Joe Biden, for example, aims to get the US power sector running completely on clean energy by 2035. Electrifying buildings and transportation so that they can use solar and wind instead of oil and gas is one way governments and the private sector have moved to slash greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOuYHA"&gt;“Wind and solar power are giving us more reasons to be optimistic about our climate goals as they break record after record,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a press &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/renewables-are-stronger-than-ever-as-they-power-through-the-pandemic"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR1zI0"&gt;Renewable electricity capacity grew by 280 gigawatts last year. The uptick amounts to a 45 percent rise in renewables last year compared to the year before. The IEA expects another 270 to 280 GW to come online this year and again in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R7UDqU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies purchased renewable energy at “record-breaking” rates &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xuzzVK"&gt;Governments and companies purchased renewable energy at “record-breaking” rates last year, according to the IEA, and their appetite is still growing.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167305/amazon-renewable-energy-purchases"&gt;Amazon proclaimed itself the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; in the world in December 2020, beating out former record-holder Google, and it now has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210419005307/en/Amazon-Becomes-Europe%E2%80%99s-Largest-Corporate-Buyer-of-Renewable-Energy"&gt;8.5 GW&lt;/a&gt; of renewable energy capacity globally. The IEA’s estimates for global renewable electricity growth over the next couple of years are now more than 25 percent higher than previous estimates it made just six months ago. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s self-contained $1,300 Vive Focus 3 headset has a 5K screen and ships June 27th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Focus 3 standalone headset" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emqyIrNREKkb728llo-5je26Dk4=/0x34:2000x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269122/VIVE_Focus_3___front_angle_low.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YAnzsU"&gt;HTC is revamping its Vive Focus standalone virtual reality headset, adding a 5K screen, a 120-degree field of view, and a swappable battery. The Vive Focus 3 follows HTC’s Vive Focus Plus. Like its predecessor, it’s a self-contained product that uses inside-out tracking instead of external sensors, designed for business customers. The headset will be released worldwide on June 27th for $1,300 — a price that includes tech support and a suite of business services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvT296"&gt;The Vive Focus 3’s biggest specs upgrade is its display. The headset uses one 2448 × 2448 panel for each eye with a 90Hz refresh rate, compared to 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye with a 75Hz refresh rate for the 2019 Vive Focus Plus. (For the record, there’s no Vive Focus 2 — HTC seems to be retroactively giving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18280855/htc-vive-focus-plus-standalone-vr-headset-controllers-pricing-release-date"&gt;the Focus Plus&lt;/a&gt; that status.) That’s a leap over the 2160 x 2160 pixels per eye you’d find with the HP Reverb G2, a more significant bump over the 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye of the Oculus Quest 2, and a vast improvement over first-generation VR headsets from a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Vive Focus 3 back view" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03bKNiZvxHoWCcFtXE8lqWO7cjw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506483/VIVE_Focus_3___reverse_angle_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="agYQ7H"&gt;The Focus 3’s 120-degree field of view also improves on the Focus Plus’ 110 degrees. Where the Focus Plus had a built-in battery, the Focus 3 has a swappable battery that’s mounted on the back of the headset for better balance. HTC promises two hours of battery life and a quick-charge system that will restore 50 percent of the battery with a 30-minute charge. And it uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 chip — based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 — in place of the Focus Plus’ Snapdragon 835.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB1nk7"&gt;HTC also says the Vive Focus 3 will be more comfortable than its predecessor, thanks in part to features like the back-mounted battery, as well as a reworked strap design. Both systems use built-in speakers. But HTC touts a new and improved audio system, including an “audio privacy” setting that reduces the amount of sound people around you can hear — a running issue with VR headset speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S1Xm1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Vive Focus 3 could be a Quest 2 competitor — but HTC isn’t interested for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcq0bS"&gt;The Vive Focus 3 has a lot in common with Facebook’s consumer-focused Oculus Quest 2, which was released last year. The Quest 2 is also a standalone, XR2-powered VR headset. And while HTC’s first controllers were trackpad-based remotes, it’s moved toward a system that basically mimics the Oculus Touch controller. The Vive Focus 3 design features a Touch-style analog stick, two triggers, two lettered face buttons, and one menu or home button on each controller. Hand tracking — which the Quest 2 also supports — is supposed to arrive in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shLRho"&gt;The Vive Focus Plus had &lt;a href="https://service.viveport.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037218671-What-do-I-need-to-do-to-start-a-VIVEPORT-Streaming-session-"&gt;a streaming system&lt;/a&gt; for wirelessly playing PC games on a headset, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400197/oculus-quest-2-air-link-pc-streaming-v28-launch"&gt;the Oculus Quest 2’s Air Link&lt;/a&gt;, and the Vive Focus 3 includes Vive Business Streaming, a cable-based system for connecting it to a PC. (Wireless streaming will be added later, HTC says.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HTC Vive Focus 3 controllers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TOXuzCHQhC2EnFecmmRTDIxB1-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22506485/VIVE_Focus_3___Controllers.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9neWh"&gt;HTC Vive general manager Dan O’Brien describes the Vive Focus 3 as higher-end than the Quest 2, not only in specific features like screen resolution and a replaceable battery, but in overall ergonomics and performance. It’s one of only a few headsets that directly compete with the Quest 2’s all-in-one design. And unlike Facebook, HTC doesn’t require a social media-based sign-in — arguably the worst feature of the Oculus Quest 2, and a factor some VR fans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;have called a dealbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guJifZ"&gt;But HTC is steering consumers away from the headset. The company is still maintaining a consumer-focused games store called Viveport, and O’Brien says HTC expects some gamers to buy its newly announced Vive Pro 2. But the Vive Focus 3 was designed with feedback from carmakers, professionals running simulation training, medical companies, and other enterprise customers. Instead of including consumer media or fitness apps, HTC provides services like a centralized device management system or six months of free Vive Sync, a &lt;a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2020/04/30/htc-vive-opens-free-beta-vr-collaboration-app-business-vive-sync/"&gt;VR meeting and collaboration tool&lt;/a&gt; that launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UXzeLK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HTC isn’t completely out of the consumer business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLUNxu"&gt;O’Brien says that selling business hardware is simply more sustainable right now than selling to consumers — largely because of price expectations. “The consumer market has gravitated toward these artificially subsidized price points that really only one company in the world has any tolerance for,” he says. That company is Facebook, which sells the Oculus Quest 2 at a starting price of $299 — less than a quarter of the Vive Focus 3’s cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOyZ7e"&gt;“If we wanted to take our products and try to compete in that space, we would have to make the active decision as a for-profit company to lose money for the foreseeable future,” then make it up through software sales or a system like Facebook’s advertising model, O’Brien says. “That’s a very different business model and market, whereas the enterprise and professional market is a very healthy and rapidly growing market where we can bring real value and solutions.” Competitors like Varjo have taken a similar tack, experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21720748/varjo-vr3-xr3-vr-ar-dual-resolution-headsets-price-shipping-specs"&gt;innovative display systems and augmented reality features&lt;/a&gt; but aiming their efforts solely at businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5ois6"&gt;By contrast, HTC’s consumer-focused Vive Cosmos “has not performed as well as we would have liked,” although the company is still looking at ways to advance the brand. “I think the consumer story is still yet to be told from HTC, but that’s something to be told in the future,” says O’Brien. The Vive Focus 3 isn’t part of that story — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC unveils new Vive Pro 2 with 5K resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oPxABQnTZp2GSLtsMLnSxOn0A1g=/522x0:6119x3731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69269156/VIVE_Pro_2___front_right.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VTl4pf"&gt;HTC has unveiled the new Vive Pro 2, an update to its high-end virtual reality headset that adds a host of small but worthwhile improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QZWWI"&gt;The biggest change is the new display, which now offers 5K resolution (or 2448 × 2448 pixels per eye), 120Hz refresh rate, and a 120-degree field of view. That’s a decent step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16863136/new-htc-vive-pro-vr-headset-announced-ces-2018"&gt;original Vive Pro&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2018, which had a 2880 x 1600 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, and 110-degree field of view. The new Vive Pro 2 also supports Display Stream Compression, or DSC, a first in a VR headset. DSC is a visually lossless standard most frequently seen in high-end monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFcsLg"&gt;As a result of all this, HTC says the Vive Pro 2 delivers “minimal motion blur.” The company also claims that the meshed lines noticeable in many older VR headsets, commonly known as the screen door effect, have been “virtually eliminated” — although these have vastly improved in other newer devices like the Oculus Quest 2 and HP Reverb G2, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vcv9Xq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10492404"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A4HLXJ"&gt;Display aside, the Vive Pro 2 has the usual ergonomic features of high-end headsets, including adjustable straps, quick-adjust sizing dials, and adjustable interpupillary distance (IPD). The integrated headphones are Hi-Res Audio Certified with 3D spatial sound, and the headset also works with third-party headphones. The new Vive Pro 2 will also work with all Vive SteamVR accessories, including Vive trackers, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323093/htc-vive-pro-vr-facial-lip-tracker-third-gen-tracker-announcement-price"&gt;new Vive Facial Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, and any SteamVR controllers and other accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfw2Fy"&gt;Design-wise, the renders make the new Vive Pro 2 look a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; sleeker and more compact than its predecessor. Though we’ve not yet received weight or dimensions of the new headset nor seen it in person to actually compare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfT0yD"&gt;If you’re upgrading from the original Vive Pro, HTC is running a special promotion during the preorder period, selling the headset on its own (without controllers or external trackers) for $749 / £659 / €739. Once that promotion ends, the price for the standalone headset will be $799 / £719 / €799. A fully kitted-out Pro 2, including Base Station 2.0 and controllers, will be available to buy from June 4th for $1,399 / £1,299 / €1,399.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="do3O5E"&gt;YouTube plans to pay $100 million to creators who use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt;, its TikTok competitor, throughout the next year. The goal is to encourage creators to pick up and continually post to its new service, which doesn’t otherwise give creators a built-in way to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buXQFo"&gt;Exactly how much creators can earn is still up in the air. YouTube says that it’ll reach out to creators on a monthly basis, looking for people with the most engagement and views. “Thousands” of creators could get paid each month, YouTube says, and basically anyone who posts to Shorts is eligible. The one caveat is that their videos have to be original content, and, of course, abide by YouTube’s community guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dObFNy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok has started paying creators, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8gpeUW"&gt;YouTube started launching Shorts in the US in March. The short videos appear in YouTube’s mobile app and, just like TikTok (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram Reels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;), you can swipe from one to the next in an endless full-screen feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAHzRj"&gt;Other companies have taken the same approach to encouraging creators to stick with their platform. TikTok launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335404/tiktok-creators-monetization-fund-followers-youtube-content-videos"&gt;a $200 million creators fund&lt;/a&gt; in July 2020, and Snapchat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;paid out $1 million per day&lt;/a&gt; for a period of time after its TikTok competitor, Spotlight, launched in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKxdAx"&gt;Payments will be available in the US and India — the two regions Shorts has launched — to start, but YouTube plans to expand its availability as it rolls out the service to more regions. There’s no specific date yet for when YouTube will start offering payments. YouTube says the fund will last from its start this year through some point in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
