        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price and larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;With Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;invite to its September 14th event just going out&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;rumors circling that new AirPods might be on the docket&lt;/a&gt;, we may see new versions of the standard AirPods soon. Luckily for those who seek a deal on the tried and true current crop, many of the most popular models routinely see discounts. There are often sizable sales on the second-gen base AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods with wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpo0N4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard second-gen AirPods, save for one thing: their case can be charged via the included Lightning cable or a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charger to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s PowerWave pad&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend saving more and opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=vergeairpodsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $160 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above and offer noise cancellation. They also come with swappable silicone tips and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music in June&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $170. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $190 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 at retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Simply Mac in the past, there are currently few sales that deep to speak of. The best price right now comes from &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals090221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get a new pair of AirPods Max for $470, as long as you don’t mind the silver color scheme. The Max are also currently available in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $499, which is their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google says Android 12 is a ‘few weeks away,’ makes beta available on Pixel 5A</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JKu9hDgm-mwKRqgwrMcJFhK0CIE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69830535/ajohnson_210813_4713_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Et3S04"&gt;Google is releasing what it says is the fifth and final version of the Android 12 beta, adding that the official release of the full Android 12 operating system is “just a few weeks away.” The new beta release will also be the first one that Pixel 5A owners will be able to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzzUsN"&gt;People who are already running the beta aren’t likely to notice much of a difference, as its focus is on getting developers ready for the impending official Android 12 release, rather than adding new features. But, for those who’ve gotten their hands on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google’s latest phone&lt;/a&gt;, there’s now the opportunity to see what that release will be like before it happens — and without a ton of risk, since the beta has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;entered its “platform stability” phase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMak6I"&gt;The Pixel 5A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627253/google-pixel-5a-specs-price-screen-battery-availability"&gt;launched in late August&lt;/a&gt;, and the beta hasn’t been officially available on it until now. While the phone’s launch has been limited — it’s only being sold in the US and Japan — anyone who’s picked one up can now play with the new version of Android before it officially releases. If you’re like me, running the beta could be a way to get some experience with a new release before it officially launches and you start getting questions about it from family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AvhWac"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 12 brings big UI changes that may prompt questions from less techy family members&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MIULNa"&gt;For this specific release, that experience may be useful. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12 is a big UI redesign&lt;/a&gt; (at least on Pixels) with a theming system, a new widget system, and a different location for smart home controls and Google Pay. Though the OS’ official release is imminent, when you’ll be able to install it depends on your phone’s manufacturer. If you’re a Pixel 5A owner, though, or you have any of the other supported phones, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442576/android-12-public-beta-install-how-to-update"&gt;follow our guide on how to install the beta&lt;/a&gt; to get Android 12 as soon as you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter takes on Facebook Groups with invite-only Communities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQZe4G0c6z8svuO-u6nKfZtzcLE=/0x4:1320x884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69830548/Twitter_Communities_hero.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S85jJ4"&gt;Twitter is launching Communities, its rival to Facebook Groups and Reddit, for tweeting with others who share specific interests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9iHKZ"&gt;Starting Wednesday, Twitter users can be invited to an initial batch of Communities that include #AstroTwitter, #DogTwitter, #SkincareTwitter, and #SoleFood (a group for sneaker enthusiasts). Once people join a Community, they can tweet directly to other members rather than to just their followers. Only members of a Community can like or reply to tweets sent by other members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPzVNv"&gt;Similar to how groups on Facebook and Reddit’s subreddits work, each Twitter Community will have its own moderators who are able to set rules and invite or remove people. Twitter invited a handful of users to create the first Communities and will let anyone apply to create their own &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/communities-interest"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. “Communities are just invite-only for now, but we’re working on ways for people to discover and join Communities they want to be a part of,” the company said in a statement. That makes Communities harder to join than subreddits or public groups on Facebook. Twitter is also approving moderators to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AloP93"&gt;Communities is a somewhat obvious move for Twitter, given that its users have long formed niche groups around specific interests, like media and crypto. Twitter is now formalizing that dynamic into a product that it plans to eventually put front and center on the main navigation bar of its mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFkpVV"&gt;Those who have access to Communities on iOS can access them through the tab on the navigation bar, while users on the web will see a Communities tab on the sidebar. On Android, you’ll only be able to read Community tweets for now — additional functionality is “coming soon,” Twitter says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0Uwv90lKU32yRFqi8k1FUbdXDc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22833067/LEq8g8SJJehgbNSEi7FAl3Qnb8C3ciak5BAhHgVFhWi3pcjUJVQKUbZ5XKn1dL4vTufxy4ZP4_MeJOtDb1bLOYVpfc_7h0HIoVcdjQgJ6rwNoeLN_0wQ_UHura288IsIw3q319G9_s0.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SaEUlL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature could make Twitter more compelling for casual users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ukeAS"&gt;Twitter has long struggled with retaining people who come to it and don’t consistently find relevant tweets or accounts to follow. To help fix the problem, the company has in the past couple of years prioritized recommending topics, such as professional sports teams, to follow. If Twitter lets anyone create and easily promote their own Communities, the feature could make the app more compelling for casual users who haven’t put in the effort to heavily curate their main timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7hOGU"&gt;Twitter first previewed that it was working on Communities in February &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;during a presentation to investors&lt;/a&gt;, saying its goal was to make it “easier for people to form, discover, and participate in conversations that are more targeted to the relevant communities or geographies they’re interested in.” That implies Communities could also take on apps like Nextdoor by suggesting groups for people who live in a specific city or neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZCYUt"&gt;Communities is the latest in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"&gt;string of big product bets from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; over the last year, including its audio chat feature Spaces, paywalled tweets, and push into newsletter hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yefJSC"&gt;Sony announced that it will &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/08/welcoming-firesprite-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"&gt;acquire UK-based studio Firesprite&lt;/a&gt;, the developers of &lt;em&gt;The Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Playroom VR. &lt;/em&gt;It’s unclear what Firesprite might be working on in its new first-party capacity, but executives are already hyping what’s to come. “Firesprite’s ability to weave best-in-class gameplay with new technology is exceptional and I think fans will be excited about their creative vision for the future,” Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, &lt;a href="https://www.firesprite.com/news/2021/09/sony-interactive-entertainment-to-acquire-firesprite-games/"&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xlFfS"&gt;Firespite was founded by staffers from Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Liverpool studio, so there are already strong connections between the two companies. While Firesprite’s experience with &lt;em&gt;The Playroom VR&lt;/em&gt; could suggest that the company is working on a game for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609558/sony-playstation-psvr-oled-aaa-eye-tracking-controllers"&gt;Sony’s next-gen PlayStation VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, in an &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-09-08-why-playstation-is-buying-firesprite-one-of-the-uks-fastest-growing-games-studios"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hulst didn’t commit to anything. “It’s too early to talk about what specific platforms or experiences that we’re going to collaborate on with Firesprite,” he said. “But that experience [in VR] is very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I0zAQG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Firesprite will be the 14th studio in the PlayStation Studios lineup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oG5ZgG"&gt;Firespite will be the 14th studio in the PlayStation Studios lineup. The acquisition is the third in what’s been something of a buying spree for Sony as of late; it acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555358/sony-housemarque-returnal-developer-acquisition-bluepoint"&gt;Housemarque in June&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nixxes.com/nixxes-joins-playstation-studios/"&gt;Dutch studio Nixxes in July&lt;/a&gt;. Other PlayStation Studios include big names like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developers Insomniac Games, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641595/horizon-zero-dawn-60fps-update-ps5-1-53"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developers Guerrilla Games, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; developers Naughty Dog.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple refuses to make NDA concessions for workplace harassment and discrimination</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yPjN3UK_5g4r2ehk6z-GB0W621I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69830232/acastro_170731_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GUhJoO"&gt;Apple, like many tech companies, has an intimidating employment agreement that it makes employees sign to protect its trade secrets. Though the agreement is in place to prevent workers from sharing internal details of Apple’s products and processes, it is unclear whether they can speak out about working conditions, according to a group of activists and Apple shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TSvVF"&gt;Now, that group is pushing the company to add language that makes clearer exception for cases of workplace harassment and discrimination. Apple has refused. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.niaimpactcapital.com/apple-resolution"&gt;they filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; to pressure Apple to make the change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilqmYS"&gt;“We approached Apple in good faith and encouraged them to take a leadership role here,” says Ifeoma Ozoma, who’s helping to lead the effort. “Their response was to use the same employee handbook that they’ve reportedly been using to silence workers as an excuse to say no. We responded that this wasn’t acceptable — and curiously haven’t heard back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jLnYx"&gt;Ozoma is co-sponsor of the Silenced No More Act, a California bill that would protect employees who speak out about workplace misconduct, even if they’ve signed an NDA. On August 30th, &lt;a href="https://sd20.senate.ca.gov/news/2021-08-30-senator-leyva%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Csilenced-no-more-act%E2%80%9D-clears-final-legislative-hurdle-and-advances"&gt;the bill passed the California state legislature and advanced to Governor Newsom’s desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xd61yP"&gt;The effort stems from Ozoma’s own experience &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;breaking an NDA to speak out about discrimination at Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;. In California, employees technically have the right to discuss sex discrimination. But there’s nothing that protects those who go public with experiences of racism — a gap that left Ozoma vulnerable to litigation when she decided to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiS5GF"&gt;As the Silenced No More Act inches closer to becoming law, Ozoma has been pressuring tech companies to proactively adopt the following language in their employment agreements: “Nothing in this agreement prevents you from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that you have reason to believe is unlawful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0eXMq"&gt;Ozoma says Apple lawyers declined to add the language, noting that it’s already covered in the company’s Business Conduct Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqqJbs"&gt;However, in recent months, some Apple employees have voiced concerns that the company is doing exactly that: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;making it difficult for them to discuss wages and working conditions&lt;/a&gt;. Ozoma says there’s also a key difference between adding this language to an employee handbook and putting it in an employment agreement which would legally protect workers who speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4TpWU"&gt;Apple’s internal misconduct policy also says that employees can be fired for “Engaging in activities or behaviors that violate Apple policies,” “Interfering or failing to cooperate with an investigation,” as well as simply “insubordination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8w7Hh"&gt;On Friday, Nia Impact Capital filed a shareholder resolution saying that concealment clauses — or employment agreements that contain broad arbitration, nondisclosure, or non-disparagement agreements — are bad business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSg2JS"&gt;“We filed this shareholder resolution at Apple because a company’s use of concealment clauses is both a governance and a diversity concern,” says Kristin Hull, CEO of Nia Impact. “Concealment clauses block investors from understanding true workplace conditions and may undermine diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The Board, as the representatives of the investor, should be concerned about the role concealment clauses play in enabling harmful corporate cultures to continue, hidden from stakeholders.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpbbIP"&gt;The firm owns 38,921.34 Apple shares — a stake currently worth roughly $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGCZEs"&gt;If Apple does not make the requested changes, the resolution may go before a vote at the next shareholder meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPC97B"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouNrgu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNPDw2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best part of Life is Strange: True Colors is that you can finally binge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ik8wQcE8uYwIPrKNmEv_Y7Urns=/449x0:3689x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69830251/lis_tc_launch_longlist_019.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A game that balances horror, heartbreak, and mystery  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="COF4dF"&gt;At this point, the &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange &lt;/em&gt;formula is well established. Each game follows a young adult going through some kind of personal trauma, while also learning to deal with a newfound superpower, whether it’s time travel or telekinesis. So far it has worked in a few different flavors: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up"&gt;the original felt a bit like an interactive &lt;em&gt;Veronica Mars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003367/life-is-strange-2-season-review-xbox-ps4-pc-dontnod"&gt;its sequel built on that with a bold and overtly political story&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is the latest entry in the growing anthology, and it once again features a troubled kid with special abilities who’s struggling to keep it together. It also makes a big change by ditching the episodic format and releasing the complete story all at once&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfeqAk"&gt;Aside from that, it doesn’t mess with the formula much, nor does it make the daring narrative leaps of &lt;em&gt;LiS2&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, it feels like a refinement. It takes the best parts of &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; — choice-driven gameplay, characters you’ll fall in love with, a vibe that’s like an interactive indie rock album — and applies them to a new dark mystery that’s hard to put down. And that’s a whole lot easier now that you can binge the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5OBkqD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; centers on Alex Chen, a 21-year-old who has spent nearly a decade bouncing around the foster care system. At the outset of the game that’s about to change: she’s getting ready to move in with her estranged brother in an idyllic small town in Colorado. It’s an eccentric and charming place with a kick-ass record store, a pub run by a man full of fatherly wisdom, a dispensary with an art studio in the back, and stunning mountain views no matter which direction you look. After so long without a real home, it’s maybe the perfect place for Alex to settle down for a bit. She easily falls back into a familial routine with her brother — one of the first things they do is rock out in an embarrassing air guitar session — and quickly befriends seemingly everyone in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DNJwFQYL8GF4c2rpSXN0QrjH0Sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834047/lis_tc_launch_longlist_044.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GJoIe"&gt;Of course, this is &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt;, so things don’t stay so peaceful for long. I won’t spoil the specifics, but there’s a significant death fairly early on (I can say from experience that even if you know it’s coming, it still hits really hard) that leads Alex down a rabbit hole of figuring out how it actually happened. At its core, &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is a classic small town murder mystery, the kind where everyone seems like they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a suspect once you dig in a little. Eventually, you’ll learn that there’s a sinister history to the place, including a powerful corporation with a strong hold on the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD1l7o"&gt;What makes it feel distinctly like &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; comes down to a combination of gameplay and tone. If you’ve never played any of these games before, they’re essentially interactive dramas, where you spend as much time watching events unfold as participating. Your interactions mostly come in two forms: making decisions and investigating. Often the game will present you with a binary choice that influences how the story plays out, or how other characters respond to Alex. That could mean intervening in a domestic squabble or choosing with whom to flirt. (&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; presents two very appealing romantic options that can be hard to choose between.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GYptNz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the team behind Life is Strange: True Colors created its empathetic new lead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22393602/life-is-strange-true-colors-alex-chen-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SN6fuW"&gt;The twist here is Alex’s power, which allows her to see someone’s “aura.” Essentially, she can tell how someone is feeling by looking at them — they’ll glow different colors depending on mood — and then use that to delve further into their psyche. This can play out in a few different ways. Sometimes, she’s able to change someone’s emotional state by learning about them and saying or doing the right thing; other times she can use that information to help people in more practical ways. In one scene, Alex helps an amnesiac remember what they were doing. In another, she is able to talk a scared young boy into following her to safety. Her power feels perfectly in tune with the game. &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; has always been a series about listening to and helping people; here it just becomes an overt gameplay mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Po9GjZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; also does an incredible job when it comes to pacing and tone. There are times when the action is so fast, and you have to make a hard decision in a split second, that my heart was truly racing. In other moments you can just lounge around on a dock thinking about life. The game lets you linger when needed, both with moments and characters, so you can fully understand them. Things also get incredibly dark, particularly in the later chapters, when Alex is forced to confront the innermost conflicts of both her friends and herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQXZUiWX1CCMK8tg2Ut7Qah21WQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832633/05_Steph_Sadness_Power_1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NJYkng"&gt;It balances this out with lots of chill, even playful moments; one chapter takes place almost entirely inside a goofy LARP, and one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the game involves helping Alex figure out just what she wants to do with her life. The game jumps between horror and heartbreak, dad jokes and drama, with an ease that’s rare to see in games. &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of game where you’ll be as worried about whether your crush likes you as you are about solving the grisly crime at the center of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMUNqG"&gt;The biggest change in &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; comes not from how the game plays, but how it’s being released. Historically, the series has been episodic: each new entry is divided into chapters, which are then released periodically every month or so. It’s a great idea, but the realities of game development often meant there were huge gaps between episodes, making it hard for the story to maintain momentum. In &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt;, this is no longer the case: all five chapters are being released at once, and the story benefits from this kind of close connection, where you can see the ramifications of your choices without struggling to remember what happened last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Mz9SHF"&gt;The anthology format has helped keep &lt;em&gt;Life is Strange&lt;/em&gt; fresh across three main entries, but it also comes with a significant risk. This is a series where so much relies on your investment in the characters; these stories work because you want to help characters like Max Caulfield and Sean Diaz live a better life. Luckily, despite a new setting and lead, &lt;em&gt;True Colors&lt;/em&gt; has exactly that. I played through the entire thing in two sittings — not because I had to see how it ended, but because I needed to make sure that Alex was alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyFqIR"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Life is Strange: True Colors &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches September 10th on the PC, PS4, PS5, Stadia, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Basilisk V3 has more LEDs and a brilliant scroll wheel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2E8Hx20bGk2uoEjMFgMklfgJTBU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829838/razerbasiliskv3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Basilisk V3 features more RGB LEDs than the previous iteration.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PR0aIJ"&gt;Razer’s new Basilisk V3 wired gaming mouse has arrived with more features than its predecessor, as well as a slightly lower price. It’s out now at Razer’s online store, Amazon, and Best Buy from $69.99, a $10 price drop from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMqWn5"&gt;Its scroll wheel houses the biggest improvements, borrowing a trick from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18531144/logitech-g502-wireless-gaming-mouse-lightspeed-price-specs-features"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt; and G502 Hero. A button positioned next to the Basilisk V3’s wheel can toggle between a staggered scroll mode that offers tactile feedback and a free-spinning mode that lets you sail down the page freely. There’s also an optional feature within Razer’s Synapse software that automatically switches between the two modes depending on the inertia of your scroll, engaging the free-spinning mode with lots of power or keeping it notched during more relaxed line-by-line scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kIHdhPVHVNjmfaYiY5aCgYffrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832021/razerbasiliskv3toggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The side button that toggles the DPI is fixed to the V3, while it was removeable in the last-gen mouse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pe24py"&gt;The change that makes it possible to tell apart the Basilisk V3 from the V2 is the new Chroma RGB lighting, one of Razer’s signature stylings. The Razer logo, the trim of the scroll wheel, and a translucent trim lining the bottom of the mouse can light up. Also, the side-mounted DPI sensitivity toggle button is fixed on the V3, whereas it was optional on the V2, leaving it up to you whether you wanted to stick it on magnetically or leave it off. The V3 is also missing the V2’s bottom dial that adjusts the scroll wheel’s tension, but the new free-spinning option is a worthy replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h12yYf"&gt;It’s interesting to find Razer putting more effort toward appealing to a broader audience than just gamers. While the Basilisk V3 is definitely still a gaming mouse in terms of specs and overall design, it might cater to others who wished that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21375181/razer-pro-click-type-ergonomic-wireless-mouse-mechanical-keyboard-humanscale"&gt;Razer’s more productivity-focused Pro Click&lt;/a&gt; shipped with as many features as this $69.99 wired mouse. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In Netflix’s Don’t Look Up, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence are astronomers trying to save the world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRXmCNWzcbmp9YZ-15KC20hoAQs=/0x0:660x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829792/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KPlwzD"&gt;It’s not quite as terrifying as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654021/moonfall-trailer-date-halle-berry-roland-emmerich"&gt;the moon falling&lt;/a&gt;, but Netflix’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; deals with another space-related disaster: a comet that’s on a collision course with the Earth. The twist here is that, after two low-level astronomers (played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) discover the problem, no one seems to believe them. That includes a president played by Meryl Streep, with Jonah Hill as her annoying son (and chief of staff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36q1YW"&gt;The first trailer looks like a lot of fun, and the cast is similarly impressive; outside of main stars there are also appearances from the likes of Ron Perlman, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Cate Blanchett, and Tyler Perry. &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; was directed and written by Adam McKay, whose past credits include &lt;em&gt;Anchorman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Step Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tzwJ"&gt;The movie will stream on Netflix on December 24th, after premiering in select theaters on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that Amazon’s game engine can be used to aid humanity in a zombie apocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="zombie (AMC)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOQ5N4lPCMZxbr_XZskU8wKkQTs=/33x0:528x330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829691/zombie.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YoOol0"&gt;Amazon’s in-house game engine, Lumberyard, can’t normally be used for life-critical or safety-critical circumstances, as stated in the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/"&gt;terms of service agreement for Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;. Things like medical equipment, automated transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, crewed spacecraft, or military use in connection with live combat are all off-limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jG9qPG"&gt;Almost all software and hardware come with extensive mandatory agreements that you need to comply with to use them, so these rules are understandable and probably for the best. At the same time, you should also know that some of those rules will go totally out the window in the event of a zombie apocalypse, should it (hopefully not) ever happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J9LbTj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@oddpride/video/7005317474723859717" data-video-id="7005317474723859717" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@oddpride" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oddpride"&gt;@oddpride&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;who's excited for ✨spooky season✨   &lt;a title="funfacts" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funfacts"&gt;#funfacts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="funny" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funny"&gt;#funny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="spookyseason" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spookyseason"&gt;#spookyseason&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="spoopy" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spoopy"&gt;#spoopy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="lifeisgooddance" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lifeisgooddance"&gt;#lifeisgooddance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Astrid Lundberg" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7005317356155112198"&gt;♬ original sound - Astrid Lundberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wJNf1A"&gt;Some of us were recently reminded with &lt;a href="https://m.tiktok.com/v/7005317474723859717.html?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESPgo8qYkwdR%2FZ90KOvtWKp8pFNfJZOTyuSbeA2XRL1Ri6mCykoa%2FR4nU%2BzceExV%2FTylw9x9RpRJ4u28YPMrQ%2BGgA%3D&amp;amp;checksum=0fe081c130b1ae3e05fe3708c7e6f028f2a77a8d1962013d673f37326d4f7187&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA3sZqFWVQMOSmlVAdEcGW8agXvp7Mpt8l6LjVD5MQiXK_8ZE-FB4Wmij3ku3-ESP4&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=7005317474723859717&amp;amp;share_link_id=e5d1958b-e76d-4af8-beaf-b61e57c3a6cc&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1631059093&amp;amp;u_code=d9082je908b5je&amp;amp;user_id=6750040876368266245&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=android&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;this TikTok&lt;/a&gt; of that &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;caveat in the terms that will let users do more with Lumberyard. While the terms stop just shy of calling it an actual “zombie apocalypse,” it’s not leaving much to the imagination in its thorough and very creative description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NG4GWe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/"&gt;In section 42.10, about halfway down this page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that these restrictions will lift if the CDC (or a successor body with similar authority) certifies a “widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.” In other words, a real zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U45KR5"&gt;Good to know. Keep this in mind, developers. Amazon’s Lumberyard may be your go-to option in the event of a pandemic that is, thankfully, totally different than the one we’re currently living through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2lD9d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DC’s latest superhero crossover: Batman x FaZe Clan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUDqDNXPJsLYtVf-Gum6DN8C7tw=/0x0:1988x1325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69829596/FaZe_x_Batman_Cover_2_cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Batman x FaZe Clan | DC Comics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZyhV9v"&gt;Ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.dcfandome.com/"&gt;DC’s FanDome&lt;/a&gt; event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650092/dc-fandome-2021-date-batman-gotham-knights-sandman-fortnite"&gt;next month&lt;/a&gt;, the comics company celebrates &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/09/08/celebrate-batman-day-on-september-19"&gt;Batman Day&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2021/09/08/dc-sets-the-stage-for-global-batman-day-celebrations"&gt;a slew of superhero-themed items for fans&lt;/a&gt;. That includes a new ten-episode scripted podcast on HBO Max, an augmented reality app, and, of course, a limited-edition comic featuring some of the stars of FaZe Clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hskIoj"&gt;While we didn’t actually see that last one coming, it is a real thing that will be available in comic form on September 24th. According to DC Comics, you can expect to see FaZe Banks, FaZe Apex, FaZe Temperrr, FaZeRain, FaZe Adapt, FaZe Rug, and FaZe Blaze as heroes, all followed by a slew of crossover merch dropping throughout Batman Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iNpKIJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faze Clan CEO talks growing pains, global expansion, and lawsuits ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004897/podcast-vergecast-lee-trink-faze-clan-interview-apparel-lawsuits-expansion"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BrVJwy"&gt;Fulfilling co-owner Lee Trink’s statement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004897/podcast-vergecast-lee-trink-faze-clan-interview-apparel-lawsuits-expansion"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he believes “gaming is going to drive culture and lifestyle for this next decade for sure,” FaZe Clan is the first gaming organization to create a comic with DC, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239034/faze-clan-studios-film-tv-projects"&gt;with its own in-house studio&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unlikely to stop there. If you can’t wait to mix up your gaming and your comics, don’t forget to check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399355/batman-fortnite-zero-point-comic-book"&gt;the six-issue run of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Zero Point&lt;/em&gt; released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. It pulled the caped crusader into the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe and provided an unusual peek inside the lore of Epic Games’ battle royale title.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman x FaZe Clan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LBaa3y"&gt;For the Batman augmented reality experience, kids of all ages can install the DC: Batman Bat-Tech Edition app on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.dcbatmanbte"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dc-batman-bat-tech-edition/id1544139344"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, now updated with a new mission to mark the event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: The Audio Adventures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mcoDYb"&gt;If you prefer an audio experience,&lt;em&gt; Batman: The Audio Adventures&lt;/em&gt; is available starting today exclusively within HBO Max, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609212/hbo-max-podcast-exclusive-batman-audio-jeffrey-wright"&gt;first of many for the service as it adds on scripted audio content&lt;/a&gt;. Once the episodes are live, you should be able to find them by searching within the app. It’s not an ideal podcast listening experience, and it will be interesting to see how many people actually seek the episodes out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zsKf6"&gt;According to a press release, it’s written by Dennis McNicholas with inspiration from &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; and the 1960s TV show. Jeffrey Wright voices Batman, Rosario Dawson is Catwoman, and John Leguizamo appears as The Riddler, while other notable appearances include Chris Parnell, Kenan Thompson, Alan Tudyk, and others. A companion 80-page comic will be released in October.&lt;/p&gt;
