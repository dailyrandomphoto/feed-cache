    <title>Amazon is still having another server outage, but Twitch is back up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EQ1VIP9rWgSwY7OP9kuViZqvUgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70276721/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aG5j0H"&gt;Amazon Web Services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829544/amazon-web-services-overwhelmed-network-outage"&gt;barely finished the postmortem&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;last week’s incident that interrupted deliveries and shut off feeds from security cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and now it appears AWS is having problems again. While last week’s outage was in the US-EAST-1 region, reports suggest connections to the company’s US-West servers are failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1iLTt5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  We are aware of several issues affecting Twitch services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our team is aware and hard at work fixing them - we'll continue to update you, here.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1471144138473189382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YoC5qt"&gt;The network of Amazon server farms powers more services than you can imagine, but the most visible sign of trouble is the fact that Twitch, the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform, is currently inaccessible for most of us. A tweet from its support account says, “We are aware of several issues affecting Twitch services.” After a few minutes, the site and app started working again, suggesting today’s issues will be short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5axcdt"&gt;There are also reports of disconnections for services like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, DoorDash, Duo, Slack, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBjGTS"&gt;A message on the &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;AWS Status page&lt;/a&gt; says, “We are investigating Internet connectivity issues” for both the US-WEST-1 and US-WEST-2 region. The last outage lasted several hours before things returned to normal, but as of 11:01AM ET, Amazon posted another message saying “We have identified the root cause of the Internet connectivity to the US-WEST-1 Region and have taken steps to restore connectivity. We have seen some improvement to Internet connectivity in the last few minutes but continue to work towards full recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JmIDg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 11:11AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Twitch status, and AWS restoration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sifu’s stunning martial arts combat will appeal to a generation of kung fu fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pjB26wW4skpkApc01u-z58lH2zo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70276813/SIFU_Reveal_Screenshot_1920x1080_CorridorAfter.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQ3gfE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;, the newest game from &lt;em&gt;Absolver&lt;/em&gt; developer Sloclap, feels like exactly the kind of shot in the arm the roguelike genre needs. Far too many of that style of game favors sword and board combat in medieval or otherwise indeterminate but distant past fantasy settings. &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; is a refreshingly modern take on the die-and-restart style of play that ditches the sword in favor of these hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ic8Bv8"&gt;I got to play a bit of &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; in a hands-on preview that demos the first half of the second chapter. The preview dropped me right into the action — no tutorial mission, no story explanation, just a destination simply known as The Club. The preview makes you fight your way through the club, battling simple minions that go down in one or two punches to heavy hitters that require more skill and planning to take down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8L2po"&gt;I immediately fell in love with &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s aesthetic. It’s just a touch more colorful than realistic games but not fully neon-splattered. Combat presents an interesting dichotomy in that it’s simple to execute by stringing together combos of button presses, but hard to master such that you’ll get your ass beat quickly and often if you rely on button mashing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zJ9LvF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10925391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCwwwD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; cleverly iterates on traditional roguelike elements, which adds to its refreshing appeal. Death doesn’t immediately reset your progress, instead you have a death counter that increases along with your age. Immediately after you fall, you can spend XP earned from successful fights to add and upgrade your abilities. Then you get back up again, right where you fell. Each death adds to your age starting at age 20. When you die at age 21, since it is your second death, you age up to 23. Your third death, you reawaken at 26 and so on. Every time you die and age, your health decreases but your damage increases. You’re &lt;em&gt;older&lt;/em&gt;, but you’re also &lt;em&gt;wiser&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8makF"&gt;You are not allowed to age infinitely, you have a magical pendant with five charges that expire at set intervals that decrease the older you get. Once you reach 77 years old or around the eighth or ninth death, your cycle of reincarnation ends and you’re forced to start the level over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vx8sfJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every time you die and age, your health decreases but your damage increases. You’re &lt;em&gt;older&lt;/em&gt;, but you’re also &lt;em&gt;wiser&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkdQjg"&gt;I really dig the aging factor for another reason: the main character is smokin’ hot. He could get it at any age, but I find he’s at his zaddiest from age 34 and up when his beard and hair are the most luscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQ83MR"&gt;Absent any significant story beats outside of a pressing but vague need to find a man named Sean, it’s hard to say how well &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s story is developed. &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; trades on powerful, culturally significant imagery of Chinese people and their martial arts tradition. Without careful consideration coupled with the involvement of Chinese people versed in these traditions during every stage of the development process, it’d be painfully easy for &lt;em&gt;Sifu &lt;/em&gt;to fall into offensive or at least culturally insensitive stereotypes. I hope &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s development didn’t fail to clear that minimum requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7cI9F"&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt;’s fluid, authentic-looking combat I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;can see why the game has been highly anticipated since its announcement: kung fu combat like this just doesn’t exist in video games right now. Plus, with a generation of gamers growing up on Chow Yun-fat, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li movies, the streets were aching for a proper kung fu / martial arts combat game. From what I’ve seen, &lt;em&gt;Sifu&lt;/em&gt; fills that long overdue need. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite holiday gifts under $25</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hmOmJpmNb4T-khZllyzUdXq1IDg=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70159579/Budget_25.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cross some names off your list without spending a mint&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CQfDlO"&gt;It should go without saying, but the best gifts aren’t always the most expensive. There are plenty of affordable pieces of tech and non-tech items that would make for great gifts or stocking stuffers, many of which should still arrive in time for the holidays despite fast-approaching shipping deadlines. If you’re in need of ideas, we recently polled &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to curate a budget-based wishlist that spans our favorite tools, gadgets, and other goodies that can typically be had for around $25 or less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srxYmk"&gt;The responses we got ranged from practical to personal, from helpful to hilarious. Whether you’re in the market for a vest to keep your beverage from getting chilly, a sadistic puzzle that will take any Rubik’s Cube fan down a peg, or chopsticks from a galaxy far, far away, our budget-friendly gift guide is a manifestation of everything that you want, but nothing you need. Even if you’re shopping for yourself instead of someone special, we know that our suggestions will help make your life a little easier or, at the very least, coax out a smile. After all, pens that say what we’re all thinking tend to have that effect on people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fA97UR"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSPEED-programmable-connectivity-hyper-fast/dp/B07QN369XX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G604 was originally available for $99.99 but is currently discounted to $44.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price we’ve seen for this versatile, MOBA-oriented mouse. The G604 features a powerful 25K DPI optical sensor and 15 programmable buttons. Perhaps the most striking feature of this claw-shaped mouse is the cluster of six buttons above the thumb rest that is ideal for storing macros. This mouse may lack the trademark RGB lighting present with most gaming mice, but this lends the G604 an impressive battery life, reportedly capable of lasting up to 240 hours with a single AA battery.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IEhYj2"&gt;One of the more impressive ambidextrous mice available from Logitech, the G903 Hero, features a 25K DPI sensor and has buttons that can be added or removed depending on if you’re a righty or lefty. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Rechargeable-Compatible-Ambidextrous/dp/B07NSVMT22?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Regularly $149.99, this mouse has been discounted to $89.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This wireless mouse features a total of 11 programmable buttons and can last up to 140 hours on a single charge, but it is also compatible with Logitech’s Powerplay charging system, which allows the mouse to constantly charge, even while in use. The Powerplay mat is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Powerplay-Wireless-Charging-Lightspeed/dp/B071WZ56G9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold separately at Amazon for $119.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus now supports Apple’s new group watch feature SharePlay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfpfUK9Gqz-DNbryLZtSRkwVLK0=/0x360:2160x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70276344/SharePlay_Encanto_EN_US.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UlsLPO"&gt;Apple users will now be able to stream thousands of movies and series on Disney Plus with friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kD8OUy"&gt;Apple started rolling out its anticipated SharePlay feature to iPhone users with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;iOS 15.1 update&lt;/a&gt; (and on macOS with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833132/shareplay-mac-macos-monterey-12-1-update"&gt;latest Monterey update&lt;/a&gt;). SharePlay allows Apple users to sync their playback for supported streaming in FaceTime services so they can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749161/iphone-ios-15-facetime-share-play"&gt;watch movies and shows&lt;/a&gt; or listen to music together in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PB2WZZ"&gt;Disney already offers a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix"&gt;GroupWatch feature&lt;/a&gt; of its own, but SharePlay allows users to FaceTime while doing other things on their Apple devices when a video is playing on their screen. If you’re watching on your iPad, for example, your video will appear as a picture-in-picture tile while you navigate across other apps on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Skt1G"&gt;Disney announced today that the feature is supported across its catalog, including for upcoming titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757196/the-book-of-boba-fett-first-trailer-disney-plus-star-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698341/disney-encanto-animation-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For a step-by-step guide on using SharePlay, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749161/iphone-ios-15-facetime-share-play"&gt;has you covered&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLcPLP"&gt;As is the case with GroupWatch, SharePlay will not be supported on kids’ profiles on Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VkFhd"&gt;To stream Disney Plus content using Apple’s SharePlay feature, make sure your Apple devices are updated to iOS 15.1, tvOS 15.1, or iPadOS 15.1 or later. Sadly, SharePlay isn’t a workaround for free streaming, so you’ll need to have an active Disney Plus subscription to use the feature as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos promised a blood testing revolution — here’s what’s really possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos corporate headquarters" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fpan8wcojkE0n_lie3At5QKsBw=/0x0:2888x1925/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70276355/1002771068.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Innovation is possible, even if it’s not magic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IpZZU4"&gt;When a new biotech company leapt into public consciousness with the bold promise of a product that could run hundreds of medical tests in a doctor’s office on a single drop of blood, it sounded too good to be true. David Grenache says he was skeptical from the very beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFI2DW"&gt;“That was a fantastical claim,” says Grenache, former president of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. “I think myself and all of my colleagues just looked at each other and said, ‘No way. That’s not possible. The technology doesn’t exist.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViBNbq"&gt;The technology didn’t exist. Theranos, despite all its flashy promises, wasn’t actually able to run tests accurately in its device on a single drop of blood. Two years &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-theranos-timeline-the-downfall-of-elizabeth-holmes-a-silicon-valley-superstar-11631576110"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; the company closed its labs, its charismatic founder Elizabeth Holmes and former company president Sunny Balwani were indicted for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnZghj"&gt;With the end of Holmes’ trial approaching and Balwani’s trial set to kick off in January, the Theranos chapter in the blood testing tech story is coming to a close. But the dream of eliminating trips to the lab by doing diagnostics on small, portable machines and on smaller amounts of blood isn’t over. Other companies have pressed forward over the past decade. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased interest and investment in at-home testing that may benefit easier blood testing, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZTyPoP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the dream of eliminating trips to the lab by doing diagnostics on small, portable machines and on smaller amounts of blood isn’t over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IrSAS5"&gt;But will any of them be able to carry out Theranos’ promise? Grenache says he doesn’t think so — and that many of the hurdles that made experts so skeptical of Theranos’ pie-in-the-sky claims still exist today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmbeIZ"&gt;“Any claim like that, that sounds too good to be true, should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GcnbyR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A single drop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ak4to"&gt;Blood tests do a lot: assess how well organs are working, diagnose immune disorders, and flag changes that could hint someone has cancer. Typically, they require a trip to a doctor’s office or a lab to siphon off around a shot glass’s worth of blood. That blood is then analyzed by specialized machines that can be anywhere from desktop computer to refrigerator sized — machines that might only be found at a separate, off-site lab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEaFzs"&gt;Theranos promised to change that process by only taking a few drops of blood, which it said it could use to run lots of tests at once on a scaled-down, small machine that could fit on a desktop. “We’re able to do all the testing using just a single microsample, rather than having to draw a dedicated tube for each type of test,” Holmes &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/02/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vksN3l"&gt;Reasonable research teams are pursuing versions of those goals, says Mike White, a genetics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Multiple groups are working on developing ways to miniaturize tests and put them onto a small chip so that they could be used at a bedside or in an office, he says. It’s a painstaking, resource-intensive process — groups have to validate each test they’re shrinking down, one by one. “It’s quite challenging to do that, but there are a lot of possibilities, and a lot of technological developments,” White says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnL7VU"&gt;And devices that can run multiple tests also aren’t that unusual. Dozens of tests can be run on a machine called the Siemens Advia 1800, which is around the size of a minifridge. The pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic also pushed forward new efforts to develop tests that can check for multiple diseases at once, says Catherine Klapperich, director of the Laboratory for Diagnostics and Global Healthcare Technologies at Boston University. It became important to test for flu and COVID-19 simultaneously, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pKSOlG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s no magic bullet, and that was the weird thing about Theranos’ claims”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmNnI0"&gt;But combining those two features — devices the size of a desktop that can run hundreds of tests — is harder to pull off. And it becomes even less so when you add in the idea that they could work off of a few drops of blood. “There’s no magic bullet, and that was the weird thing about Theranos’ claims,” White says. “They seemed to claim that they had one key trick that made a whole bunch of different things easy, and that turned out not to be true.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nreGW7"&gt;Sometimes, a single drop makes sense. People can accurately check their blood sugar levels on a finger stick, and finger sticks can also measure how well someone’s blood clots. But other tests might need more blood to get a clear picture of someone’s health. A tiny drop of blood might not have high enough concentrations of a particular protein, for example, that a testing device would need to detect it accurately. Drops of blood are also so small that each one tends to have different amounts of various cells and platelets, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article/144/6/885/1761216?login=true"&gt;research from 2015 found&lt;/a&gt;. The study took six drops of blood in sequence from 11 people and found that the levels of things like hemoglobin (a protein that carries oxygen) and white blood cells varied widely between each drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLzdiX"&gt;That could mean a difference between flagging a potential problem and missing it. Some illnesses cause low hemoglobin counts, for example. A single drop tested might not pick up that signal or could show lower levels just because of the makeup of that specific drop. “For certain things, you can take a million drops of blood, but a bunch of them — or most of them — are not gonna have what you need,” Klapperich says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FkJg9z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A test that could test a whole bunch of things like that would still be progress, even if it’s not from one drop of blood”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BrBwiX"&gt;Still, there are efforts to up the number of tests that can accurately run on smaller amounts of blood at the same time. “A test that could test a whole bunch of things like that would still be progress, even if it’s not from one drop of blood,” White says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXfRJO"&gt;But there’s still a limit on how many tests can be run on each bit of blood, Grenache says. Some require &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nuffieldhealth.com%2Farticle%2Finside-the-pathology-lab-what-happens-to-my-blood&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22834348%2Ftheranos-blood-testing-innovation-drop-holmes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chemical reactions&lt;/a&gt; that change the blood enough that it can’t be used for other things, while others extract individual components of the blood, similarly rendering it useless for subsequent tests. “You’re not going to do 100 tests,” he says. “I don’t see that happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QsbpAS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A chilling effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LRk6oV"&gt;The Theranos saga, though, stalled efforts to make progress toward the blood testing improvements that experts think are possible. While the company was still out in public making grand, sweeping claims about how many tests it could run on drops of blood, academic researchers working on similar blood testing problems struggled to get funding for their own work. “People told me it had a chilling effect on funding,” White says. “Why should the NIH fund something if Theranos has already solved the problem?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgKQ2h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it had a chilling effect on funding”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TqdZBS"&gt;And then, when a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-theranos-timeline-the-downfall-of-elizabeth-holmes-a-silicon-valley-superstar-11631576110"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; investigation first revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Theranos couldn’t actually accomplish what it had promised, investors still didn’t want to fund the projects. “There was this phase of well, you know, that’s a scam, so we’re not going to invest in these types of companies at all,” Klapperich says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4c4T9f"&gt;Even scientists are a bit more likely to knee-jerk assume new blood testing projects, especially those that say they can run multiple tests at once or can run tests on small amounts of blood, aren’t realistic. It was always important to approach those claims with a healthy degree of skepticism, Grenache says. But before Theranos, people might not have dismissed them outright as impossible. Now, people are more likely to, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pw7m5R"&gt;The past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, likely helped counteract Theranos’ chilling effect on investment into new types of testing. The overwhelming need for fast, easy-to-use diagnostics supercharged the development &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323268/covid-rapid-testing-pandemic-home-disease-pcr"&gt;of at-home tests&lt;/a&gt; and opened up billions of dollars in funding. Even though COVID-19 testing uses nasal swabs or saliva, the realizations about how important rapid, bedside tests could be — and that they didn’t exist — could translate to blood as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ggm6GF"&gt;Theranos may have been the worst-case scenario for the testing industry, but the big-picture idea — that testing should be faster and more convenient — is still true, Klapperich says. “Now, people are trying to sort out the question of what was real about what Theranos was saying. Because we still need this stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Vivobook Pro 14 OLED review: snappy performance and a smooth screen</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Asus puts a workstation’s power in a small, pretty package&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UoW7Iq"&gt;“OLED screens in affordable machines” has been the running theme of the laptop market this year. Between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled"&gt;Lenovo’s 13-inch Chromebook Duet 5&lt;/a&gt; and various 13-inch Windows options from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt;, 2021 has really brought the OLED laptop from a luxury product to, well, somewhat less of a luxury product if you know where to look.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHD8R9"&gt;Asus’ Vivobook Pro 14 OLED is a shot at putting OLED in yet another unprecedented form factor: the midrange workstation. It’s poised to be the first 14-inch OLED laptop on the market, as well as the first OLED laptop with a 90Hz refresh rate. Of course, it won’t actually earn either of those monikers until it’s actually released, which it hasn’t been yet — Samsung (which makes the screen) and Asus are claiming “early 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoCfoz"&gt;Rather than being geared toward a multimedia experience — as are 13-inchers like Dell’s XPS 13 OLED, Asus’ own Zenbook 13 OLED, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820568/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-13-inch-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro&lt;/a&gt; — the Vivobook is here to work. It’s equipped with AMD’s capable eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HX processor and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3050 GPU. It’s targeting creative work, on the go, on a budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKkV6u"&gt;With that in mind, my test unit (16GB of RAM, 1TB of storage) is a strong package for $1,199 — less than half the MSRP of a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro"&gt;comparable 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. (Samsung gave me that price with the heavy caveat that it could change prior to release. You have my word that if that happens, I will change the Vivobook’s score accordingly and republish this review.) It has a good port selection, it’s not too heavy, and the speakers and microphones should suit whatever video calling needs you have. Still, there are odd things here and there that you won’t see in more expensive devices (and even plenty of others at this price point). It’s an impressive and powerful machine that still won’t be the right daily driver for everyone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bu9Oji"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Asus Zenbook 13 OLED review: dazzling, to a point","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22538867/asus-zenbook-13-oled-review-amd-ryzen-specs-features-price"},{"title":"Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021) review: cut by the Blade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22702219/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2021-gaming-laptop-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="SQzXp6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10920042"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The touchpad of the Asus Vivobook Pro 14 with the numpad illuminated, seen from above on a white fabric surface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jfReA7wVDBhbb1mCwTyZpv3KDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980363/akrales_211102_4815_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, handy numpad in the touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W0CDvB"&gt;If you’re considering this Vivobook, it’s probably because of the screen. I’ll vouch for that: The 2.8K (2880 x 1800) 16:10 OLED panel is very nice and higher resolution than you generally see on OLED laptops of this size. It’s got impressive contrast, vivid colors, and sharp details, reproducing 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut and maxing out at 399 nits of brightness. The trademark of OLED technology, of course, is that blacks are totally black (since the individual pixels just turn themselves off). Samsung claims that the panel emits less blue light than other screens as well, and you can select an “Eye Care” color profile that yellows everything slightly in the MyAsus app.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqxKgq"&gt;The 90Hz refresh rate, while likely not a necessity for too many people’s jobs, is also a nice bonus. Scrolling is pleasantly smooth — once you get used to it, switching back to 60Hz is downright painful. This is certainly going to be one of the smoothest screens you can get at a $1,199 price point (again, assuming that the Vivobook stays there). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Vivobook logo on the bottom bezel of the Asus Vivobook Pro 14, up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YAvTOMEFztJrgfg9bZQoVrLN8j0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980369/akrales_211102_4815_0033.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus, Samsung, and AMD in one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lhZ7qe"&gt;If the screen isn’t what piqued your interest in the Vivobook, then it was probably the chip. The eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HX in my unit is the most powerful processor that AMD makes for thin and light laptops. It’s unusual to see such a powerful chip combined with a GPU in such a small device — excluding Apple devices, this is one of the most powerful 14-inchers on the market.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Vivobook Pro 14 closed, seen from above, on a white plush chair." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yF4agH84pjPuYlEzwVgKeKBgFm0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980374/akrales_211102_4815_0129.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid is... conspicuous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLGkUa"&gt;You can take a look at the chart below to see how the Vivobook did on various synthetic benchmarks. It should go without saying that the Ryzen 5900HX and RTX 3050 are handily beating what we’ve seen similarly sized AMD machines with integrated graphics like the Zenbook 13 OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tIRfmI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s unusual to see such a powerful chip combined with a GPU in such a small device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zO2AXY"&gt;The more important question for a lot of creative professionals is where exactly the Vivobook stands among MacBooks, which are the current gold standard and the machines we unambiguously recommend to anyone for whom money is no object — they also have exceptional screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Jpxud"&gt;The bad (but unsurprising) news for Asus is that the Vivobook got less than half the score that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; got on PugetBench for Premiere Pro, which measures video export and playback time at 4K and 8K. (The MacBook got a 1072, to the Vivobook’s 494.) It also took twice as long to complete our real-world 4K export (though that task is a weakness of AMD’s and a strength of Apple’s) — it took seven minutes and 36 seconds, where the Macbook took just two and a half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74DXvx"&gt;But it &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;get scores better than those of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; (which is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch"&gt;$700 more&lt;/a&gt; for comparable specs) on some of these benchmarks, and is comparable on most of the others. There’s a convincing argument that if you’re considering the 13-inch MacBook Pro for whatever reason, the Vivobook Pro is worth taking a close look at, too. (The 13-inch OLED Zenbook took over 14 minutes on the export and got a 201 on the benchmark.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Vivobook Pro 14 keyboard with the numpad illuminated seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JaIKpimV6ucMUbgBHeIMPDs7UiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980365/akrales_211102_4815_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not weightless, but it’s surprisingly portable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PhMTuy"&gt;Also impressive was just how easy these tasks seemed to be for the 5900HX. The Vivobook’s fans were running throughout my benchmark testing, but they were always quiet enough that I could work on another device at the same desk with no distraction. CPU temperatures were very under control throughout the synthetic benchmarks — I saw some spikes during the export but nothing above the high 80s (Celsius). In other words, these famously CPU-heavy tasks weren’t working the Vivobook too hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tzQLH8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10920065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wy0eRZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CPU-heavy tasks weren’t working the Vivobook too hard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QUVoq2"&gt;Now, there’s a caveat to all this: battery life. The Vivobook’s battery life is not great, and it’s one area where the device is far behind everything Apple currently sells. That’s not necessarily surprising, given the high refresh rate and high resolution of the display. OLED technology is supposed to mitigate those penalties somewhat, since it’s turning off pixels here and there, but even operating in dark mode with a completely black desktop background, I only averaged six hours and 37 minutes of continuous use. (That was with a load of around a dozen Chrome tabs, with occasional Zoom calls and streaming video). That’s not a terrible result, but it’s worse than many laptops in this price range. The primary benefit of a 14-inch form factor is the ability to use it away from your desk, and battery life is likely a big consideration for folks shopping in this category. Six and a half hours just puts a sour taste in my mouth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5NSPa"&gt;The other thing for “Pros” to note is that the configurations seem somewhat limited. The specs the Vivobook comes with may change closer to release (and I’ll update this review if they do), but from the sheet I was given, it seems like I have the top model. That means you can’t configure this device with more than 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, which — even with a capable processor — really limits what you can do with the device. (It’s not possible to upgrade the RAM or storage yourself after the fact, either.) Add the lack of Thunderbolt ports, which limits compatible peripherals such as external drives and docks, and you’re looking at a device that may be below the needs of many professional workloads. (There’s also not a 4K screen option listed here, if that’s something you need.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Vivobook Pro 14 on a white plush chair open angled to the left. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVaYYLczaldboUH3RRwC7ZPaiBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980366/akrales_211102_4815_0027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 90Hz refresh rate can’t be helping that battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qtDgaw"&gt;The rest of this computer is pretty good. The audio is strong, with no distortion at maximum volume. The microphones did a fine job of filtering out loud dishwasher noise in the background of my Zoom calls. The keyboard is quite springy with a comfortable texture — I will note that the deck is a bit flimsy and my keystrokes sometimes depressed the deck, which I know is a thing some people hate (and I have a fairly light stroke, as they go). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCuaNh"&gt;One cool thing is that if you press a little button in the top right corner of the touchpad, an LED numpad pops up on it. (This is a staple of a number of Asus laptops.) It’s potentially useful, and it doesn’t get in the way of using the touchpad, but the button is sensitive enough that I occasionally pulled up the numpad with my palm by accident while I was typing. Slight annoyance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Lc7Vow"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10920075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TZWZo"&gt;Assuming this Vivobook stays at the price I’ve been given, it’s a great deal. It also seems like, as we said of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, a bit of a tweener. Realistically, I’m not sure how large the constituency is who’s looking for a processor this powerful with a discrete GPU but is also fine with just 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. The so-so battery life, given this device’s thin and light stature, may limit the audience further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cymfq"&gt;I see this mostly as a device for people looking for a primary driver who want to game or edit on the side. This is a good affordable option for that crowd, but you’re also somewhat getting what you pay for — editors, or others with GPU-heavy workloads, who can afford to spend a bit more on the 14-inch MacBook Pro should absolutely do so, and gamers who can live without the OLED screen can get a more powerful GPU, more RAM, and much better battery life in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702219/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2021-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xznCKn"&gt;But I’m still glad the package exists; 90Hz OLED screens are really a joy to use, and they’re a thing I hope we see more of at this accessible price point down the road. And with its Ryzen 5000 series, AMD continues to bring power to thin and light laptops that we haven’t seen in years past. This is more so an exciting thing to see than something I’d recommend most people buy. But it is very exciting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside the slow, strange collapse of electric delivery startup Chanje</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9maj_WB78I4NzjSd-2ig-W9bZKU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275989/acastro_211001_4790_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How an EV startup and its charismatic CEO nearly cornered the market for electric delivery vans — until it all fell apart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="e1WjBe"&gt;Gaia. Mother Earth. God herself. Ask the former employees of electric vehicle startup Chanje and they recall slightly different versions of what &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; CEO and founder Bryan Hansel said he saw during an ayahuasca trip in the Amazon rainforest in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwIoCi"&gt;What they know for sure is Hansel repeatedly referred to this experience as a touchstone. It was his reason for founding the startup, which was premised on importing electric delivery vans from China and selling them to companies like FedEx, Ryder, even Amazon. He also recommended employees take ayahuasca to change their perspective at difficult moments, like when some bucked against the meditation quotas — part of a sweeping, mandatory “personal and professional development” program he installed  — or when the paychecks stopped coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueBnfQ"&gt;Chanje quietly folded earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned. The Chinese company Hansel partnered with went bankrupt after its chairman sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into an unsuccessful toll road in Mongolia. Hansel spent months trying to rally investors to buy pieces of that parent company to keep Chanje alive. His effort failed, though, and so he fired the remaining Chanje employees the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="75aeyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A small startup, a big opportunity, and a lot of collateral damage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OD60td"&gt;Six of those former employees, who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the condition of anonymity throughout the year, describe Hansel as “charismatic” and a natural pitchman, but also a “narcissist,” “manipulative,” a “snake oil salesman and a con man.” Hansel, during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in November, said he was simply too optimistic about the financial — and geopolitical — challenges Chanje faced the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdEbrm"&gt;Chanje caused real collateral damage for such a small startup. It still owes many of its former employees months of back pay and promised bonuses; at least four have sued the startup. Ryder also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337230/ryder-chanje-lawsuit-fedex-electric-vans-startup-delivery"&gt;sued for more than $3 million&lt;/a&gt; after Chanje failed to deliver most of the vans it promised to the fleet company.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xen1I"&gt;The startup’s collapse left FedEx in the lurch, too. Chanje promised the shipping giant 1,000 electric delivery vans, but never delivered them. It also abandoned a project to build out charging infrastructure at FedEx depots across California — infrastructure that was meant to be the groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311210/fedex-carbon-neutral-2040-2-billion-electric-vehicles-planes"&gt;company’s $2 billion push to become carbon neutral&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQpYVk"&gt;FedEx is now suing Chanje in an attempt to recover some of the millions of dollars it paid for that charging infrastructure. But as Ryder has already found out, there may not be anything left — and Hansel has already moved on to his next big pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTCcMbOEBxN3gIZOiOCgajJ95sA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070992/acastro_211001_4790_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zrb8Hv"&gt;Chanje wasn’t Bryan Hansel’s first foray into electric vehicles. In fact, the startup’s origins are more complicated than an inspirational drug trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GD41hc"&gt;Before Chanje, Hansel worked at a company called Smith Electric Vehicles. It’s the oldest electric vehicle company in the world, founded in 1920 in the United Kingdom. Smith spent much of the 20th century building short-range electric delivery vehicles and, at one point, held the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Electric_Trucks/NwDEDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=%22smith+electric%22+mister+softee&amp;amp;pg=PA135&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;exclusive rights to make electric Mister Softee ice cream vans&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YY2ANf"&gt;In 2007, Smith was looking for a way to establish a presence in the United States, which was home to more big fleet companies and was starting to see much larger investments in the clean energy space. Hansel had spent years working in product development and had previously bought a company from the investment firm that owned Smith. That firm tapped Hansel to become the CEO of a new Smith US subsidiary in early 2009 — despite his lack of experience in the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nBglCo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew nothing about electric vehicles, but it was just another product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WOQifd"&gt;“I knew nothing about electric vehicles, but it was just another product, and I felt the timing was right,” Hansel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J520d"&gt;The US had become such a hot spot for early electric vehicle hype that, in March 2010, Hansel made a bold pitch: he wanted the US subsidiary to &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2010/08/16/story6.html"&gt;buy out the parent company&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. Smith’s owners accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXp4sX"&gt;Smith became an American company as the world was reeling from the financial crisis. But the US government started investing in green tech companies as it tried to rescue the economy, and the Obama administration believed it found a darling in Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUVeet"&gt;Standing in front of a bright green-and-white Smith Electric van in &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/07/08/smith-electric-just-one-example-innovation-kansas-city"&gt;July 2010&lt;/a&gt;, then-President Barack Obama stumped for his administration’s decision to toss the company a $32 million Recovery Act loan. (Smith &lt;a href="http://earth2tech.com/2009/08/07/3-under-the-radar-battery-grant-winners/"&gt;also received a $10 million Department of Energy grant&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxK9km"&gt;Smith’s employees were helping the US fight through a “vicious recession” and “building the economy of America’s future,” Obama said. Investments in clean energy were going to inspire a wave of new jobs “year after year after year, decade after decade after decade, as companies like Smith, that start small, begin to expand,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ye37uL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJNvtsA2BPY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="64ZCec"&gt;Then, Obama revealed Hansel had pitched him something big: “I was just talking to your CEO, and he says he wants to open up 20 of these [factories] all across the country, so that in each region ... Smith is able to service its customers, and they’re going to have a reliable sense that Smith is always going to be there for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IeXrU"&gt;Hansel and Smith tried to ride the White House’s support to an initial public offering in late 2011. But by the time the deal was ready, the market had soured on clean tech startups. Hybrid sports car startup Fisker Automotive &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/fisker-karma-recalled-over-battery-fire-risk/"&gt;recalled its cars&lt;/a&gt; after problems with the batteries, and the Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.torquenews.com/1075/fisker-automotive-lays-workers-after-dept-energy-freezes-loans"&gt;froze its credit line&lt;/a&gt;. Solar car startup Aptera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22358355/aptera-ev-three-wheeled-doe-atvm-loan-program"&gt;folded at the end of 2011&lt;/a&gt; after failing to meet the requirements for a loan from the same DOE program. Most notoriously, solar panel company Solyndra went out of business after &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solyndra-bankruptcy/solyndra-1-2-billion-in-contracts-undercut-by-china-idUSTRE79H5YI20111018"&gt;Chinese companies flooded the market with cheaper products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kdjEG1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hansel told Obama he wanted to open 20 Smith factories across the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BR2ndK"&gt;Smith pulled the IPO in 2012. The following year, it stopped production at the Kansas City factory and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119012512/http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article1216484.html"&gt;abandoned plans for two other locations&lt;/a&gt; — meaning the country would never see the 20 factories Hansel had promised to Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rGNTU"&gt;Smith was saved in 2014 by &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/321529/smith-electric-vehicles-stirs-back-to-life-with-42-million-from-sinopoly-battery/"&gt;a $42 million investment&lt;/a&gt; from Chinese battery supplier Sinopoly, and Hansel once again tried to turn it into a public company — this time by acquiring a business that was &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151119012512/http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article1216484.html"&gt;already listed on the over-the-counter markets&lt;/a&gt; with no revenue and only one employee. But that deal ultimately fell apart, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;President Obama talks with a Smith employee as Bryan Hansel (in orange) watches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wX2PYZ"&gt;With Smith limping, Hansel joined his daughter on a 10-day trip to the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador in early 2015. They stayed with an indigenous tribe, and while there, Hansel took ayahuasca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp4SUU"&gt;The drug “floored him,” a person with knowledge of the excursion said. Hansel rolled in the nearby river mud until Gaia appeared, he explained to the group the next day. “[She] tells him he needs to get his shit together and start being part of the solution and stop being part of the problem,” this person said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GJ4bYN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ayahuasca “floored him”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qZ4PjB"&gt;Hansel’s daughter &lt;a href="https://blog.pachamama.org/pachamama-alliance-corporate-partner-profile-nohm"&gt;blogged about the trip&lt;/a&gt;: a photo of her and her father, adorned with tribal face paint, sits atop the post. While there are no explicit references to ayahuasca, she quotes her father describing the experience. “One of the most important elements is the exposure to the existence of the Amazon and understanding the delicate reality of its existence, being immersed in it,” Hansel said about the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyVlyz"&gt;Looking back now, Hansel tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it was “a transformational trip.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DbvqK"&gt;“There’s no question it changed my life forever,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szHbF7"&gt;After Hansel returned from the rainforest, he pushed to create a new electric vehicle startup to be jointly run by Smith and Five Dragons Group — the Chinese electric vehicle maker that owned Sinopoly. Five Dragons was already designing what Hansel says was the “[Tesla] Model S” in the commercial EV space in China. He felt the best opportunity was to create a new company that would primarily focus on selling FDG’s vehicle stateside. Smith agreed to do engineering work on Five Dragons’ vans so they could be legally sold in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gqxLu"&gt;“If we can have this product in the US, we win,” Hansel says he remembers thinking at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2eyNh"&gt;After cycling through a few initial names, Hansel at one point settled on “Nohm” — the given reason at the time being that “an ohm is the measure of electric resistance. Our vision is a world in which there is no resistance to positive energy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQXNXT"&gt;In 2016, Hansel would ditch Nohm for another name: Chanje. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="dLmcik"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7x2wSj"&gt;That’s when things got contentious. Smith &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087809/Smith_Second_Amended_Complaint.pdf"&gt;sued Five Dragons Group in 2016 (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, and accused Hansel of conspiring with a Five Dragons executive named Jaime Che to create Chanje as a way to rob Smith of its intellectual property. Hansel, acting as an “undisclosed agent” for Five Dragons, “improperly exploit[ed]” his role as CEO of Smith to bait the board into what was ultimately a trap, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxF1Gf"&gt;Hansel dragged his feet sourcing orders for Smith’s electric vans, which were ready to go and which Chanje was also supposed to sell, according to the suit. This cut off Smith’s only possible source of revenue and “backed [it] into a financial corner.” So Hansel and Che offered Smith a $2 million loan from Five Dragons — which, crucially, was secured by 50 percent of Smith’s stock in Chanje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BlBPnw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smith accused Hansel of acting as an “undisclosed agent” for Five Dragons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pInwdJ"&gt;After Smith took the loan, Five Dragons demanded the Kansas City company make “deep personnel cuts,” stop development of its electric van, and close its engineering center, among other concessions. Five Dragons also refused to pay Smith for the engineering work it did on the Chinese vans. At this point, it was “apparent that the financing agreements … were a ruse designed to close the financial vice in which [Five Dragons] had placed Smith,” the company wrote in its lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjxpQa"&gt;Hansel said in an interview that the lawsuit was “literally fantasy.” Five Dragons denied the claims in court. Che told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a message that he “[did] not know what went on between Bryan and Smith but [Five Dragons] has no commercial reasons to purposely sabotage Chanje’s sales effort when we are the largest shareholder and beneficiary of any such sales.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QxkJH"&gt;Smith was never able to repay the $2 million loan. So Five Dragons foreclosed on Smith’s ownership stake in Chanje in early 2016. The suit was ultimately settled in 2018. Smith got its IP back, as well as some Five Dragons shares in exchange for completely cutting ties with Chanje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jarLko"&gt;Hansel pushed forward with Chanje. The business plan was simple: the startup would import nearly finished electric delivery vans made by Five Dragons, assemble them at a facility in the United States, and market and sell them to the myriad companies looking to go green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rii7Z3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The market for capable commercial EVs was largely nonexistent in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqhMAD"&gt;Chinese vehicles have a limited track record of success in the United States. But in 2016, Chanje was so far ahead of the curve of commercial electric vehicles — a market that Ford, General Motors, and a number of startups are only getting into &lt;em&gt;now &lt;/em&gt;— that potential customers were willing to listen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8KTpmn"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijEnCR"&gt;Plus, former employees say the van was good. It was longer than most vans in its class, so there was more room for cargo. It had a massive 100kWh battery pack — something Tesla had only just started offering — that was good for around 150 miles of range. It was pretty much the only van designed to be electric from the beginning; other options on the market were internal combustion vehicles retrofitted to run on batteries, which meant compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et9kiC"&gt;Chanje came out of stealth in 2017 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/3/16598208/ryder-chanje-electric-van-rentals-new-york-california"&gt;immediately announced a deal to provide 125 vans&lt;/a&gt; to trucking and rental company Ryder. Ryder soon helped orchestrate a deal where it would buy and then lease around 900 Chanje vans to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/fedex-is-adding-1000-chanje-vans-to-electrify-its-fleet/"&gt;one of the biggest shipping companies in the world&lt;/a&gt;: FedEx. And FedEx agreed to purchase another 100 directly from Chanje. Behind the scenes, Chanje was talking to other Fortune 500 companies, including potential deals with Walmart and Ikea, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; learned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzI8Gk"&gt;The biggest, though, was Amazon, which was on the hunt for an electric option for its growing logistics fleet. The commerce giant was so interested in Chanje’s vans that it made real-world deliveries with them during a small trial in 2018. Hansel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Amazon wanted to order more, but that he was unwilling to let the conglomerate skip FedEx’s place in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXrnzk"&gt;Amazon confirmed the trial in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; but declined to comment further. The conglomerate ultimately made a big investment in EV startup Rivian and tapped it to build a custom fleet of light-duty electric vans instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IpbVi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chanje was courting Walmart and Ikea, and even did a small trial with Amazon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ1QgE"&gt;“Obviously looking back on it, [I] could have maybe played that differently,” Hansel says now. “But at the same time, we always had a confidence that we were going to be fine until things really went sideways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg35Rm"&gt;Most of these companies didn’t have the kind of charging infrastructure that could handle a new fleet of electric vans, so Chanje planned to sell them that tech as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac5MtV"&gt;It all made for an attractive pitch, for investors and prospective employees. When Chanje hired&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Credit Suisse in 2019 to find investors, the bank projected the startup would sell 3,500 vans in 2020 for around $377 million in revenue and as many as 28,000 vans in 2024 for $2.1 billion in revenue, according to internal documents obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Credit Suisse also projected Chanje could make $44 million providing charging infrastructure to its customers in 2020 and as much as $270 million in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0agPv"&gt;Hansel’s pitchman qualities made joining an easy decision, former employees said. “He is good at selling the story of Chanje, which, the story [was] good and the product is phenomenal,” one longtime employee explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RRSx2f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An unusual culture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MN3XVV"&gt;But Chanje’s culture was unusual. Hansel insisted that employees participate in a personal and professional development program he had designed with his personal executive coach. Employees were told to spend 20 percent of their time working on this program. There was a curriculum based in part around “The Work” by Byron Katie, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fthe-goop-podcast%2Fending-the-war-on-self-with-byron-katie%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22822775%2Fchanje-fdg-electric-delivery-vans-investigation-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;motivational speaker popular in Goop circles&lt;/a&gt;, which included required readings, mindfulness exercises, and practicing giving and receiving honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfSgTO"&gt;This created a split between younger employees and a few older ones who had come from the automotive world, including some who Hansel brought from Smith. Most of the former employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; say they were able to find some good in these activities. But the program was also a reason some people quit in Chanje’s early years. In fact, Hansel boasted about those departures in a &lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315295"&gt;2018 interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur&lt;/em&gt; magazine titled, “Everyone Quit — and This CEO Is Better Off Because of It.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7urld6"&gt;Even the employees who liked the program soured on it when Chanje’s funding started to dry up. The company started missing payrolls in 2017 and cut off deliveries to Ryder after just 22 vans, court documents show. It would quietly spend most of the next four years in survival mode, in large part because the Five Dragons Group had run into a very big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A earth globe that’s fallen out of a plastic bag, laying on the floor. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VI2VpmtrWIV4sGaxNm4WmxsjJ34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070994/acastro_211001_4790_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9i3Qgt"&gt;In 2011, Five Dragons Group chairman and CEO Cao Zhong wanted to build a road connecting coal mines in Inner Mongolia to processing plants in northeast China. Such a road would be expensive; the project ended up costing some $2 billion, and Cao himself pledged around $100 million of his Five Dragons Group stock as collateral for a loan to help build the road. He also &lt;a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2011-01/15/content_11858547.htm"&gt;raised hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; from Li Ka-Shing, the richest man in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HkduN"&gt;But when it opened in 2013, China was trying harder than ever to diversify away from coal. In 2015, Cao’s road-building company (which was separate from Five Dragons) &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2015/1117/ltn20151117017.pdf"&gt;admitted in Hong Kong Stock Exchange filings&lt;/a&gt; that the highway would be in an “incubation stage” where it would bleed money for the first few years. (In its &lt;a href="https://media-crtg.todayir.com/2021072917160288089868916_en.pdf"&gt;most recent annual report&lt;/a&gt;, Cao’s highway company lost nearly $200 million and said it’s evaluating ways to sell the highway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRbMP8"&gt;Five Dragons started to struggle as the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-11-22/china-to-pump-brakes-on-electric-vehicle-subsidies-source-101174670.html"&gt;began cutting subsidies for electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, and the country’s booming economy cooled. Cao’s failing highway only increased the burden on Five Dragons. The company was losing money, defaulting on bank loan payments, and the subsidiary that built Chanje’s vans wasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3029964/li-ka-shing-files-bankruptcy-petition-against-chinese"&gt;paying employees&lt;/a&gt; and eventually stopped work at its factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CmCEz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Five Dragons’ chairman built a massive road for hauling coal with backing from Hong Kong’s richest man&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXUfQO"&gt;Li, the Hong Kong billionaire, had also &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3029964/li-ka-shing-files-bankruptcy-petition-against-chinese"&gt;invested at least $50 million into Five Dragons in 2015&lt;/a&gt; after helping Cao fund the Inner Mongolia highway. But by 2019, his stake in the company was worth less than half the original amount. Cao had also &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2019/0927/2019092701393.pdf"&gt;personally guaranteed&lt;/a&gt; the bonds his highway company had sold to Li to fund that project — borrowings on which Cao’s company defaulted. So in September 2019, Li &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3029964/li-ka-shing-files-bankruptcy-petition-against-chinese"&gt;sued to put Cao into bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGucgX"&gt;Meanwhile, Cao’s one-time translator (and a young executive at Five Dragons) Jaime Che led a charge to usurp the CEO. Che convinced the Five Dragons board to remove Cao from the CEO post. The decision was voted on at Five Dragons’ annual shareholder meeting in September of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SiPoO"&gt;“I am doing the right thing for the company, my shareholders and employees but if some people think that I am the villain. For that, I say FOOK YOU!!!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JaimeCheHK/status/1169160589152854016"&gt;Che wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; following the meeting. “I will take the heat, I know good news will come soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pat6SH"&gt;All this turmoil at Chanje’s parent company kneecapped the startup. Beyond building the vans, Five Dragons was supposed to be Chanje’s main source of funding until it found outside investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WITLbV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For that, I say FOOK YOU!!!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4WFGEF"&gt;Hansel repeatedly told employees that the funding problem was close to being solved, the former workers said. “[We were] told for five years that it’s coming, it’s coming, it’s around the corner, it’s next week,” one longtime employee said. “And we all believed him.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf422S"&gt;That is, until the paychecks stopped coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBFenE"&gt;After skipping a few payrolls in 2017, Chanje made a habit of it in 2018 and 2019. At one point, employees weren’t paid for at least two months, multiple former workers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNv9XH"&gt;In 2019, Chanje’s employees came together for one of their usual all-hands meetings. They sat down on the polished concrete floor of the warehouse Hansel had leased around the corner from SpaceX’s headquarters. The CEO began the way meetings usually did: by having an employee lead a group meditation. The workers closed their eyes, breathed deeply. They were told to imagine a beam going through their bodies in order to discover where they may be holding tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUkgVU"&gt;At least one employee had enough, though. When the meditation ended, they asked Hansel outright: what was going on with the company’s funding, and when would they get paid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTXuco"&gt;Instead of answering, Hansel said God had come to him in a dream the previous night, and she gave him permission to share his trip in the Amazon, according to employees who were at the meeting. He told a meandering story about taking ayahuasca and seeing a plastic bag on the ground — only to later realize it was a leaf. This experience inspired him to help save the planet, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PzyWxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t know how all of us didn’t quit right then and there” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GoTnNG"&gt;Then, he preached one of the axioms of his personal development program. The problem wasn’t that they weren’t getting paid, it was that they were angry about not being paid, he said. You can choose to be happy if you want, he told them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAipcz"&gt;“Honestly, looking back, I don’t know how all of us didn’t quit right then and there,” one of the former employees said. “But even though he said those things … he still just had a way of making everybody in the room feel connected and wanting to stay together to see this thing through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcfEbR"&gt;Hansel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he and his leadership team “told people to leave” as things got rough. “We were very, very up front about [how] this is not normal, this is not acceptable,” he said, regarding missing paychecks. “We are making, as leadership, the choice to [stay]. We’re not asking you to do the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihPYvi"&gt;Looking back, Hansel says he and his leadership team were “extraordinarily transparent.” But, he said, “the consistent feedback that I have received and I think I have grown from is: ‘you’re too optimistic.’ I communicated what I believed to be the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3w6s8X"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FcaCo8"&gt;Dream missives from God couldn’t shore up Chanje’s bottom line. Potential customers were bottlenecked behind the FedEx deal, which the startup couldn’t fulfill. That made investors wary, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QFkB9"&gt;The bigger problem was China. Investors “loved the story, loved the customers, loved the team, loved the culture — loved everything,” Hansel said. But they would not do a deal with Five Dragons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuSRk6"&gt;From this point on, employees said it was a struggle just to keep the lights on. In addition to skipping paychecks, Chanje’s leadership team stopped paying employees’ health insurance more than once. Some employees paid for the company’s internet and electric bills out of pocket. Hiring bonuses were never paid out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zhe9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Paychecks were skipped, employees covered company bills&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S1DLtq"&gt;Hansel even promised a $5,000 “hardship bonus” to workers for missing payroll. That, too, was never paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lrtdZ"&gt;Meanwhile, Hansel hired his daughter and gave her control of the employee development program. She closely tracked which employees completed their tasks through an online portal and chided those who didn’t in meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7RrAF"&gt;“We were required to count our meditations, and if we didn’t do [that], it did affect our pay and our bonuses,” one former employee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwJTm3"&gt;Through all this, most employees stayed with Chanje. A big reason, some say, was that Hansel simply convinced them to — even as family and friends tried to tell them otherwise. Part of that was how Hansel wielded Chanje’s development program, one said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlNO7k"&gt;“It’s a way to get people to do things and do things well, and frankly it worked, it really turned around how I behaved at work, how I took in other people’s feedback,” the former employee said. “[But] if you use it to hinder the truth, it is a way to manipulate people, to [get them to] continue doing things that you ask of them while slogging through a bunch of shit like not being paid for almost three months at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjFg0N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hansel found a white knight in early 2020 — and then the pandemic hit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1sRTi"&gt;Hansel was able to keep most of Chanje’s employees around long enough to find a white knight in early 2020. J. Streicher, a 100-year-old Wall Street investment firm, signed &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/0320/2020032000059.pdf"&gt;a letter of intent&lt;/a&gt; to essentially buy out Chanje from Five Dragons Group for $260 million, with a $100 million payout to Five Dragons if Chanje were to go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuDxef"&gt;The novel coronavirus sunk those plans. J. Streicher &lt;a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/0703/2020070302478.pdf"&gt;backed out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62zVgA"&gt;Five Dragons was left with more than $100 million in loans that were past due, including many backed by the company’s ownership stake of Chanje. Shortly after J. Streicher walked away from the table, Five Dragons’ biggest creditor — a state-owned merchant bank — petitioned for bankruptcy in Bermuda, where the holding company was registered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLPkG7"&gt;In the bankruptcy process, court-appointed liquidators determined some of those loans that were ostensibly from three different lenders actually all had ties to Che’s mother, a powerful investor in Hong Kong. The state-owned bank accused Che of “underhandedly siphon[ing] away Company assets into the clutches of [his] mother.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8hKah"&gt;The judge in Bermuda agreed. She decided in July 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/Final%20Ruling%20-%202020%20No.%20118%20civ.%20In%20the%20Matter%20of%20FDG%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Limited%20-%20with%20citation.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that Che had conspired to stiff Five Dragons’ many unsecured creditors in favor of his mother’s companies, which were receiving interest payments on the loans. The judge essentially reset the process. Five Dragons remained in bankruptcy, and bids were solicited for the remains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lUnywg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Five Dragons wound up in bankruptcy in Bermuda&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxiqwI"&gt;(Che, in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said he told the Five Dragons board his mother was a large shareholder of one of the lenders but that she had “no control” over that company. He also said the Chairman’s actions put the company in a position where it had no choice but to borrow money at high interest rates and that he abstained from voting on the loan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6s4A0"&gt;Ten years after he successfully bought out Smith’s parent company, Hansel was one of the first in line to buy up pieces of Five Dragons in an attempt to save Chanje. He was in talks with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) run by Magnetar — a hedge fund that was &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble"&gt;at the center of the mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt; that caused the 2008 recession. The idea was for Magnetar to back him and then merge Chanje with the SPAC to take it public, according to former employees and court and stock exchange filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqN4Pj"&gt;Meanwhile, Chanje was still working to build the charging infrastructure for FedEx in 2021. Chanje installed chargers at around half of the promised 42 depots in California, employees said, though it sourced the hardware and construction work from two California subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrT5Qn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hansel also worked with a hedge fund to merge Chanje with a SPAC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QnnJfW"&gt;FedEx was paying Chanje millions of dollars to do this work, though two former employees said Hansel didn’t use all of that money to fund the charging stations. In fact, Chanje stiffed the subcontractors and instead used at least some of the FedEx money to keep the lights on. They’re not sure where the rest went. (Hansel said Chanje “had a real margin in that project” and that the startup was using those earnings to pay bills.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNKwZD"&gt;Those who weren’t working on the charging project were left to their own devices; some stopped coming into the office. Hansel continued to promise that a SPAC merger was coming that would save Chanje, but the deal with Magnetar fell apart. On the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Hansel called the few dozen remaining Chanje employees together for their weekly team meeting. He fired them all on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/To7hzz_YF9Uo0I9yyd9QrrLgAGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098169/132350237_3624957337541216_1097191523676046122_n.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jMLvE2"&gt;Chanje never initially responded to Ryder’s lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Florida in March 2021. It was only after the court started the process in June to issue a default judgement in favor of Ryder — which is owed nearly $4 million — that lawyers for the startup filed any paperwork with the court. They haven’t followed up, though, and so Ryder has again asked the court to issue a default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11Dj3u"&gt;FedEx sued Chanje in Los Angeles Superior Court in July (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097169/1803791194_1_126___1_.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) to try and recover the nearly $4 million it says it’s owed. In the complaint, FedEx says it had to pay those contractors — BTC Power and MaxGen — more than $3 million; the contractors had placed liens on four FedEx facilities after getting stiffed by Chanje. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvoBwL"&gt;FedEx also claims some of the chargers Chanje installed are broken and already need repairs. It, too, is seeking a default judgement. In the meantime, as it seeks to fulfill its $2 billion promise, this year the company &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2021/09/28/brightdrop-completes-first-of-500-electric-fedex-vans-adds-smaller-ev410-for-2023/?sh=4c752597616c"&gt;ordered vans from GM’s new electric delivery vehicle outfit, BrightDrop&lt;/a&gt;. Both Ryder and FedEx declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jum47L"&gt;In China and Bermuda, Five Dragons Group is still in the process of restructuring. It has until January 2022 to figure out a solution or be delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. (A Shanghai-based asset management firm submitted a restructuring plan in September that the state-owned bank is now considering, according to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKUTQYfxgf8"&gt;a recent hearing&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KMIstU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FedEx and Ryder are each owed millions of dollars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRabNu"&gt;At least four employees who filed complaints with California’s Labor Commission since early 2020 seeking back have subsequently sued Chanje in Los Angeles Superior Court to try and force the company to pay up. That includes Joerg Sommer, the former chief operating officer, who was owed more than $300,000 (&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23097193/1785356105_1_5_.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLP1VO"&gt;Bryan Hansel, meanwhile, has started a new company with his daughter called “&lt;a href="https://www.cohd.co/about-the-team"&gt;Cohd&lt;/a&gt;” to sell the personal and professional development plan he implemented at Chanje to other companies. Buyers can get “full access” to a “learning portal” with weekly assignments, personal reflection, and feedback logs. In return, Cohd says customers can expect things like “increased financial results,” “enhanced accountability,” and “reduced employee downtime.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yP72ib"&gt;Cohd also offers workshops and speaking engagements. But the most involved offering touted on Cohd’s website appears to be leading “offsite programming.” With those, Cohd promises to “prepare and lead multi-day offsite” trips focused on “team development” and “personal development.” Cohd’s site doesn’t mention any potential destinations, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gHutJJ"&gt;In his bio section of the site, Hansel describes his career in very broad terms. He mentions that, at one point, he “realized that as the CEO, he was responsible and was forced to look into the mirror for a change.” Under a headshot of him straining a smile sits a quote that is as much a platitude as it may be a warning: “Every CEO gets the exact organization they deserve.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Silicon Valley enabled Theranos to run wild</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmvbCyTIiicJzEiL9zy01_oLVa0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70275916/VRG_VFE_Theranos_Trial_01_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZyI7ok"&gt;As the trial of Elizabeth Holmes comes to a close, many questions have surfaced about what — or who — enabled Theranos to rise to such heights. As charismatic and ambitious as Holmes was, none of her success would have been possible without the nearly $945 million in funds she received from notable investors like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/health/theranos-investors-murdoch-devos-walmart.html"&gt;Rupert Murdoch or the Walton family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXxrfj"&gt;It’s not unusual for investors to blindly place their money into companies with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/technology/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-investors-diligence.html"&gt;little to no knowledge of their technology&lt;/a&gt;. But when those companies end up on trial for more fraud charges than you can count on two hands, &lt;em&gt;who is to blame&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngt9Ld"&gt;In the first episode of a three-part series, we look into the culture surrounding venture capital investors in Silicon Valley and what role they may have played in enabling the very fraud that Holmes allegedly conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEfk4W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
