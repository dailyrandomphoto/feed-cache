    <title>FuboTV’s fantastic live TV streaming service finally arrives on LG TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OU290gtPbBHcDit-xEHSXMeNDK0=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69419097/LG_CX_Angled_Press_Shot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fNbulC"&gt;FuboTV, one of the best over-the-top services for sports enthusiasts, is finally arriving on newer LG Smart TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhQuXE"&gt;While the app was already available on many set-top boxes like the Apple TV or Chromecast, it’s now available on LG’s native webOS platform on 2018–2021 Smart TV models (including LG’s fantastic OLEDs). That’ll give any consumers with newer LG models the ability to access the service’s 100-plus sports and entertainment channels directly from their sets, rather than having to rely on a third-party device for access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iePwM"&gt;“Over 90 percent of FuboTV’s viewership is on the big screen and today’s launch on LG Smart TVs expands FuboTV to even more smart and connected TV platforms,” Mike Berkley, FuboTV’s chief product officer, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HJtZV"&gt;Starting at $65 per month, FuboTV offers one of the most robust catalogs of sports-specific programming, though it has plenty of entertainment and news channels peppered in as well. ESPN, ESPN 2, Olympic Channel, CBS Sports Network, Big Ten Network, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, and beIN Sports channels are among those available on the service’s base tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SydJsH"&gt;But FuboTV really shines with its sport package add-ons, which offer more diversity in additional sports channels than similarly priced live TV services like Hulu with Live TV or YouTube TV. That said, regional sports networks are &lt;a href="https://support.fubo.tv/hc/en-us/articles/115005322088-What-Regional-Sports-Networks-are-available-on-fuboTV-"&gt;fairly limited&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s a persistent problem that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hulu-becomes-the-latest-service-to-lose-fox-regional-sp-1845456794"&gt;plagues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/youtube-tv-is-losing-regional-sports-channels-because-c-1845231335"&gt;nearly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/great-now-sling-tv-and-dish-are-losing-masn-and-nbc-re-1846603206"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; OTT live streaming services — not just FuboTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foD9Tn"&gt;Users on LG Smart TVs will now be able to easily record an entire series with a single click, customize their guide with their favorite channels, and add up to six user profiles, each of which will support personalized recommendations and user-specific recordings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbeccG"&gt;Unfortunately, one of FuboTV’s best features, the MultiView tool that supports up to four &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529068/fubotv-multiview-four-channels-apple-tv"&gt;simultaneous channel streams&lt;/a&gt; at once, is still limited to the Apple TV, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. But hey, at least you’ll be able to use the app on your fancy LG OLED without the help of a third-party box, stick, or dongle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the devices that can run iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rF8LPAZzq3_9X_1RzAsmkqVTLQ=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418992/887_2021_06_07_887_chromescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll get some fancy, new features, if you have the right devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YGREFX"&gt;Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; software at WWDC 2021. The public beta period will begin in July, and whether you’re curious to download them then, or just waiting for the final release, you’ll need to have the right hardware to do it. Apple usually eliminates support for a few devices each year as it leaps ahead with major software releases, so you’ll want to check below to see if your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or computer makes the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oph3LR"&gt;For iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Apple is extending support for all iPhone models that currently have iOS 14, along with the seventh-generation iPod Touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="eINVCX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RjIx6e"&gt;Here’s the list of supported devices for iOS 15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Msw5NFDQVFvpg60vzONxAhdDZqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643174/766_2021_06_07_766_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lfarV7"&gt;Now, for iPadOS 15 support, it’s the same story as iOS 15. All iPads that have iPadOS 14 will get the next iteration. Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="THJ9uE"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lmPaKpOvaosbL-2QI91CztGnTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643274/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EtLGJV"&gt;Apple’s watchOS 8 upgrade will bring the same level of device support as the ones above, leaving behind no generations that received the previous operating system update. Sensing a pattern here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BXeSf"&gt;These watches will get the update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VZk4Tz"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3 (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;maybe Apple should reconsider this&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="68CltS"&gt;Apple Watch Series 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pFvxNq"&gt;Apple Watch Series 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h5hr38"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9XXGOa"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nwxa1fTi5UrQrIKzUHK-9COSHOw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643294/image.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XWBaz1"&gt;Now for the computers that will get the update to macOS Monterey: a few models that got the Big Sur update last year have been left out in terms of support for the new software, including the 2015 MacBook, the 2013 MacBook Air, the late 2013 MacBook Pro, and the 2014 iMac. Here’s the full list that’ll get support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="i7zV7I"&gt;iMac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634"&gt;late 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DT8GDM"&gt;iMac Pro (2017 and later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TDG4DT"&gt;Mac Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202888"&gt;late 2013 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cZc8bq"&gt;Mac Mini (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201894"&gt;late 2014 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SkWfhc"&gt;MacBook Pro (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201300"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FavKjr"&gt;MacBook Air (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201862"&gt;early 2015 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SncFxN"&gt;MacBook (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201608"&gt;early 2016 and later&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8rNgiu"&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MoviePass settles with FTC over fraud and data security failures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MoviePass App As Company Makes It Harder To See Movies" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KkVFQQsoGvAfoQyXJUdr5SfSbgo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418846/1018277694.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpSucC"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission charged the executives of the long-defunct MoviePass app over allegations that they fraudulently blocked customers from using the service as advertised while failing to protect their data privacy. The FTC also announced that it had reached a settlement with MoviePass and its executives as a result of the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyql0H"&gt;Under the proposed settlement, MoviePass, its parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics, its CEO Mitch Lowe, and chairman Ted Farnsworth are forbidden from falsely representing their business and data security practices to customers. Any businesses controlled by these entities are also required to roll out comprehensive information security programs to protect consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v1E3ZF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“MoviePass and its executives went to great lengths to deny consumers access to the service they paid for”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUbE2O"&gt;“MoviePass and its executives went to great lengths to deny consumers access to the service they paid for while also failing to secure their personal information,” Daniel Kaufman, FTC acting director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection said in a statement Monday. “The FTC will continue working to protect consumers from deception and to ensure that businesses deliver on their promises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbXUV1"&gt;Last year, MoviesPass declared bankruptcy after a tumultuous two years attempting to disrupt the moviegoing business. The company offered users one movie ticket a day to any film at any theater for less than $10 a month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872984/moviepass-shutdown-subscription-movies-helios-matheson-ted-farnsworth-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that MoviePass would purchase tickets at box office prices and then give them to consumers for the tiny monthly fee, eventually launching the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113645/moviepass-bankruptcy-helios-and-matheson-subscribers-owed-millions"&gt;into bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzlbfQ"&gt;Throughout its existence, MoviePass was briefly shut down, subscription fees increased, and the number of movies users could see a month became more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqm0Nm"&gt;The FTC’s complaint accuses the company of deceptively marketing its “one movie per day” service to subscribers and barring customers from using the service as advertised. It also alleges that the company falsely invalidated customer passwords over “suspicious activity or potential fraud” in order to ban frequent moviegoers from the service. The FTC also says that MoviePass initiated a ticket verification program as a means of discouraging people from using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj3vhB"&gt;As part of the settlement, MoviePass’ operators must put comprehensive data security programs into place in any future ventures after saving MoviePass customer data in plain text, the FTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HhIEb"&gt;Since MoviePass went under before the FTC took action, the agency plans to open a docket for public comment on the proposed order, FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chopraftc/status/1401973809482174467?s=20"&gt;said in a tweet Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple WWDC 2021: the 15 biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tC7o0G99WQ3SsWDyA-1RDsYeGJk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418626/VRG_WWDC2021_Textless.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="viUgh4"&gt;Apple just wrapped up its WWDC 2021 keynote, and it was jam-packed with news and announcements, including our first looks at iOS 15, the new macOS Monterey, big improvements to FaceTime, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vamod1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22465927/apple-wwdc-keynote-2021-live-blog-updates-news"&gt;Our live blog&lt;/a&gt; has moment-by-moment commentary on what Apple announced from Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn. But if you just want to know the big-ticket items from the show, we’ve got you covered right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LAw8dw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22220915"&gt;iOS 15 brings big improvements to FaceTime, updates to notifications, and more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D6Z4Uhb_TRKu02Wcgozb2BVlh2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643347/image__4_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h4SY4o"&gt;Apple announced iOS 15, which brings improvements to FaceTime such as spatial audio, a new “SharePlay” feature that lets you share media with people on FaceTime virtually, updates to Messages, a new look for notifications, the ability to set different “Focus” statuses, updates to Memories in Photos, a redesign to the weather app, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WL8mE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;Apple is building video and music sharing into FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EK2koBM18PgZEbL47rR4EODomSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643074/lcimg_7f9d02c6_2dc4_44ff_83cf_a0e89d83127b.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EhoT4v"&gt;Apple’s new SharePlay feature will let you watch or listen to content with others virtually. Apple is also introducing a SharePlay API so that other developers can build apps that support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dDVF4H"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522859/apple-live-text-photos-notes-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;Apple is going to use AI to read all the text in your photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWjwsfwk1AQ4BA3fbd3-SuYkPPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643104/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_6.22.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="87XXLe"&gt;Apple’s new Live Text will digitize text in your photos, which can let you copy and paste text from a photo, for example, or call a phone number that’s in a photo. Apple says it uses “on-device intelligence” for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xQ15S8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc"&gt;You’ll soon be able to use your iPhone as your ID at the airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7-O5b2J8hNQ0zSgmY4kFCHk1q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643126/lcimg_b1bc491d_e93b_41f1_8ac3_a0717ab1150b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="re1asU"&gt;Apple’s Wallet will soon let you store your ID in a digital form (in participating US states), which you’ll then use as identification in US airports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h72yPd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22227853"&gt;iPadOS 15 lets you drop widgets on the homescreen and brings changes to multitasking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4Uqto7bppgfN_DbrFeRemvJTbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643163/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_10.42.38_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iHJMpC"&gt;With iPadOS 15, Apple will let you add widgets to the homescreen and access to the app library, which debuted last year on iPhone with iOS 14. Apple is also introducing improvements to multitasking, with new controls that make it easier to manage your apps, and you’ll be able to build apps with Swift Playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="paMHeJ"&gt;Apple announced new privacy-focused features at WWDC, including that Apple Mail will block tracking pixels with Mail Privacy Protection and that Safari will hide IPs. Apple is also introducing a new section in settings called the “App Privacy Report.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YulMJc"&gt;Apple will let Siri process voice requests on device, meaning audio won’t be sent over the web, and Siri can accept many requests while offline. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x4v18m"&gt;Apple is introducing a number of new health-focused features, such as the ability to share health data with your families and with healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qpr0x"&gt;Apple is making some new changes to AirPods, such as making it easier to find them on the Find My network and the ability to announce your notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2isK3h"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus bundles a VPN, private email, and HomeKit camera storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="29sSDH"&gt;Apple’s iCloud is getting a new private relay service and the ability to create burner emails called “Hide My Email.” These will be part of a new iCloud Plus subscription, which will be offered at no additional price to current iCloud paid users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cSY1yR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;Apple announces watchOS 8 with new health features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lt7uAn"&gt;Apple’s upcoming watchOS 8 has new health features, including a new Mindfulness app, improvements to the Photos watchface, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c2uDHt"&gt;Apple will let third-party accessory makers add Siri to their devices, Apple announced during WWDC. The company showed it on an Ecobee thermostat in its presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XeTmlB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey lets you use the same cursor and keyboard across Macs and iPads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nvex1T"&gt;Apple’s next big macOS release is called Monterey. One big new feature is the ability to use the same mouse and keyboard across your Mac and your iPad. Apple’s Shortcuts app is also coming to the Mac. And Monterey adds improvements to FaceTime, SharePlay, and Apple’s new “Focus” statuses that are coming to Apple’s other software platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WRuHpZ"&gt;Apple redesigns Safari on the Mac with a new tab design and tab groups&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TCt5f3T7aNKNOLRZk96aCgyN-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643328/896_2021_06_07_896_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qtNz9f"&gt;Apple is redesigning Safari with a new look for tabs and tab groups. And on iOS, the tab bar will be at the bottom of the screen to be in easier reach of your thumb. Web extensions are also coming to iOS and iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UrO0ID"&gt;Apple is bringing TestFlight to the Mac to help developers test their apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjkc1P"&gt;Apple announced that it will let developers use TestFlight to test their apps on the Mac. The company also announced Xcode Cloud, which lets you test your apps across all Apple devices in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple introduces Siri for third-party devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Na6kHEQOPltkp6vsxMt9OfrGW3A=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418452/lcimg_bdd5a604_baa2_4518_a03e_bf828a525d3e.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfREqO"&gt;Siri is finally coming to third-party devices. Apple announced at its WWDC keynote that HomeKit accessory makers will be able to integrate Siri voice control into their products starting later this year. The voice assistant will be routed through a HomePod if the devices are connected to your network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EfaW1"&gt;Apple hasn’t released a comprehensive list of devices and brands that will support Siri. The company demoed it on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%2Fecobee-smart-thermostat-apple-siri%2F%3Futm_source%3Dorganic_twitter%26utm_medium%3Dorganicsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartthermostat_siri_announcement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22523045%2Fapple-wwdc-siri-third-party-devices-ecobee-watch-tvos-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ecobee&lt;/a&gt; thermostat during its WWDC keynote presentation. It also announced support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; — a new interoperability standard that has big players like Amazon, Google, and Samsung on board — will come with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugvo3D"&gt;Apple also revealed a number of smaller smart home features. Home Keys, which allow you to remotely lock and unlock doors by tapping your iPhone or Apple Watch, are coming to Wallet app, as are work keys and hotel keys. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XhKPJss_w0FcLUjIVE1pszuMgUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643338/lcimg_2686e85d_8036_43f4_bd45_102917d9f1c2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BAAvmp"&gt;The HomePod Mini will support lossless audio in Apple Music later this year and will be able to function as a speaker for the Apple TV 4K (as does the discontinued full-size HomePod). Apple also announced that the HomePod Mini will ship to more countries this month — including Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand — as well as Italy by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dx85Oa"&gt;HomePods also now support commands for the Apple TV (so you can ask Siri to play shows), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt; now works with Apple TV, which will enable you to watch shows synchronously with friends over FaceTime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVHqG1"&gt;Speaking of Apple TV, tvOS now includes a “Share with You” row, where friends can share shows with each other via text messages. Another new row called “For All Of You” is intended to help families find shows to watch together — it will curate suggestions that combine every user’s viewing history. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkWn7cWwSc3qWXVf4CNQAmRoYqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643337/lcimg_7879a186_9bec_434c_a7bf_b805150a6a95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kOqvv3"&gt;And the Apple Watch now supports the HomePod’s intercom feature, which will allow you to talk to HomeKit-enabled doorbells and access package detection from your wrist. You’ll be able to control nearby HomeKit accessories in camera view.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple lets users see family members’ Health data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5CY5t2zUbaXFVslJ_h3STUGkC0=/5x256:806x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418399/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PvtRRE"&gt;Apple will let people share the data from their Health app with family members or others, the company announced. It’s one of a new slate of health features for iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPLlL9"&gt;With permission, someone can share access to their overall heart rate and movement data. They’ll also be able to share access to alerts, which will ping authorized users when the feature notices things like a high heart rate or change in mobility. The person they’re sharing the data with can message them directly about any changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMdbCC"&gt;“Many people around the world are caring for someone, and we want to provide a secure and private way for users to have a trusted partner on their health journey,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-personal-health-by-introducing-secure-sharing-and-new-insights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522872%2Fhealth-app-family-mobility-fall-risk-wwdc-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIwShd"&gt;The feature could be useful to caregivers who may be keeping tabs on the health of their loved ones, like elderly parents, from a distance. Older adults, though, tend to be &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article-abstract/60/5/926/5491612"&gt;less comfortable with this type of monitoring&lt;/a&gt; than their caregivers are. Monitoring tools can give peace of mind to caregivers while feeling invasive to the people tracked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY2NwH"&gt;Apple is also adding another health metric, called walking steadiness, to the Health app. It will use mobility data already collected by the iPhone to monitor for any changes to factors like balance or walking patterns, and will tell users if they’re at an increased risk of falling. The app will also include some exercises to help increase steadiness. The company says it built the system using data collected through a &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/get-involved/apple-heart-and-movement-study"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; that included over 100,000 participants of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxMNvH"&gt;Falls are a major public health challenge. Each year, around 30 million adults over the age of 65 fall, and many falls lead to injuries or other health issues. Falls are responsible for $50 billion healthcare costs a year, &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180402.25780/full/"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmsLCz"&gt;Users will now also be able to share their Health app data with their doctors. Physicians already regularly have patients &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;bringing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463322/wearables-afib-apple-fitbit-doctor-visit"&gt;readouts&lt;/a&gt; from their devices into appointments. The integration will let people transfer that data more directly. Apple said the feature will start off with support from six electronic medical record companies in the United States, including Cerner and Athenahealth. Doctors using those platforms would be able to see the data in the medical record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcjwmm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS Monterey lets you run Shortcuts and share files between Macs and iPads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbbg3kwo6UfUluS7bo1ST7-BCvM=/5x0:1564x1039/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418342/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cSXpW2"&gt;Apple has announced the next version of macOS at its WWDC keynote, after showing off iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. It’s calling it Monterey, in keeping the California location-based theme it’s had since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8Ih2W"&gt;The company is promising even more interoperability with iOS, including the ability to share a keyboard and mouse between a Mac and an iPad. The feature is similar to the one found on Logitech keyboards and mice, letting you seamlessly move your cursor and files between a Mac and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KytFw4"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple_WWDC21_Drag_And_Drop_Demo|102462" data-volume-uuid="d15336f46" data-volume-id="102462" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-33" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The jaw-dropping drag-and-drop demo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjz1Oc"&gt;Macs are also getting the ability to act as an AirPlay target, allowing you to use your Mac’s screen and speakers to play content from your iPhone and iPad. (Apple hasn’t made it clear if you’ll be able to AirPlay from one Mac to another.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shoSvl"&gt;Apple has also announced that Macs will be getting the Shortcuts automation application.  The familiar editor from iOS will be available, but with actions specifically for macOS. Apple will also be including pre-built Shortcuts for what it thinks will be common tasks. Users will be able to access Shortcuts from almost anywhere on the system, including in Spotlight, from the menu bar, and using Siri. People who have already been automating their Macs will be happy to hear that Shortcuts will be able to import existing Automator workflows (though Apple does make it clear that there will be a transition between the two over the coming years).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2q6e6Fy7sjYhax40SocirjAjoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643692/Apple_macos_monterey_shortcuts_gallery_06072021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easy Mac automation has a new face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wCx6Qj"&gt;In addition, Safari is getting a bit of a redesign, with the tabs and address bar all moving up into the same space, and the tabs getting a new, floating look that’s somewhat reminiscent of FireFox’s recent re-design. Apple has also introduced tab groups to the browser. Of course, tab groups are synced between your Mac and iOS devices, but they’re also easy to share — Apple demoed dragging a group into a Mail window, which created a bulleted list of links for the recipient. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3CqAvW5vjfWXinHsdR749MBUdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643340/image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the new Safari interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUGPIh"&gt;Apple is also bringing many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;features announced for iOS and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; to the Mac, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime’s group watching/listening abilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Quick Note&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbR5di"&gt;This is the first version of macOS that’s being announced after the rise of Apple’s M1-powered Macs, the first of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21552828/apple-macbook-air-arm-m1-chip-laptop-specs-price-release-date"&gt;was announced in November 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s plan is to have its entire line switch over to its custom chips by the end of next year, so it seems that macOS Monterey will be the operating system shepherding Macs through much of the transition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udsbPB"&gt;To see which of the previous Macs Monterey will run on, you can see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"&gt;our article breaking down the device compatibility&lt;/a&gt; of everything Apple announced today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces watchOS 8 with new health features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdhKXMz81ZBxPVMiDspBUy5xYk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418263/vpavic_120916__1220_0325_close.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lnGUo5"&gt;Apple has just announced watchOS 8, the latest version of the company’s smartwatch platform for the Apple Watch. The new software succeeds last year’s watchOS 7 and is going to be first available for developers to test their apps with starting today, with a public beta coming in July. A final public release is expected later this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBSX64"&gt;Apple is debuting a new Mindfulness app, an extension of the Breathe app that nags you to breathe throughout the day. It’s adding new animations and other features to help you relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLsMth"&gt;The Fitness app is getting more workout types for tai chi and pilates. The Apple Watch’s Health app will explicitly track your respiratory rate while sleeping and notify you if it’s outside of your normal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2lmPaKpOvaosbL-2QI91CztGnTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643274/lcimg_e0eb6a55_c77c_4513_86a9_1373f1fd5bb0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Portrait watchface is coming in watchOS 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lgd1Sj"&gt;There’s a new watchface that will let you use a photo taken with the iPhone’s portrait mode and layer text and other information behind it. Apple says you will be able to customize what text is shown and how it integrates with the image itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3op1o"&gt;Similarly, the Photos app on the watch is getting upgraded with a new layout and the ability to share photos directly through Messages or Apple’s Mail app. There are new text entry options when replying to messages. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfdVWLoOXSu2H8CfebLsVTOgAMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643282/lcimg_13fd8fbd_fc86_4ecd_bfd1_7d9df4b29e09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The suite of new features coming in watchOS 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WGGVYm"&gt;WatchOS 8 will be gaining some of the new features coming in iOS 15, including the new focus mode that lets you choose apps or contacts to push notifications to you in specific contexts. Apple says that the Series 6 watch will get support for car key support, utilizing its UWB radio. You’ll also be able to use your watch to find other Apple devices, such as AirTags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9It9pu"&gt;The Home app, which lets you control smart home gadgets from the Apple Watch, is getting redesigned for watchOS 8, with more shortcuts to commonly used devices and the ability to view camera feeds from security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ebdvyv"&gt;There are a handful of other new features coming, too, including next-hour precipitation alerts. More native apps will be able to take advantage of the Apple Watch’s always-on display, including Maps, Mindfulness, Now Playing, Phone, Podcasts, Stopwatch, Timers, and Voice Memos. Apple says it is providing an API for third-party apps to use it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvV60K"&gt;And finally, you’ll be able to set multiple concurrent timers on the Apple Watch and give them unique names. Big stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iV8Crb"&gt;Apple says watchOS 8 will be available for models reaching back to the Series 3. Here’s hoping it’s actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;possible to install it&lt;/a&gt; on that model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple adds welcome privacy features to Mail, Safari</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eqpTNvKXHPluqTh87_h-ccAycoM=/99x0:1140x694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418247/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6NgMr4"&gt;Apple has always stressed user privacy as part of its core mission. At its WWDC 2021 event, it announced it would be adding a spate of powerful new functions to Mail and Safari, as well as giving users broader insight into what their installed apps are doing with their information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY8N9Y"&gt;First, Apple’s Mail appears to have declared war on tracking pixels, which can be included in some emails to give third parties insight into if or when their messages were opened — though it didn’t provide much detail on how it will win said war. According to Apple’s manager of user privacy software Katie Skinner, Mail will also now hide user IP addresses by default. Safari, likewise, will hide IPs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjyDso"&gt;More surprisingly, Apple announced it’s adding an App Privacy Report, which will live in settings and provide an overview of, as you might have guessed, privacy-related matters as they relate to installed apps. For example: how often apps use your contacts, microphone, location, or other data and identifiers. The App Privacy Report will also show which third-party domains are receiving your information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s iCloud Plus bundles a VPN, private email, and HomeKit camera storage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YIPlYqXEVsi9RAs3v35AHhh9NSs=/186x0:2127x1294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69418241/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_4.31.47_PM.10.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus logo. | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WuFNaz"&gt;Apple is amping up iCloud with a new set of features called iCloud Plus. The cloud storage service will now come with access to a VPN, burner email addresses, and unlimited storage for HomeKit-enabled home security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ng1oBX"&gt;The VPN, called Private Relay, will route your internet traffic through two relays in order to mask who’s browsing and where that data is coming from. Apple is trying to distinguish the feature from traditional VPNs — and if you ask, Apple will tell you it’s not a VPN at all — in part because it sends data through that second hop. That second hop prevents any one party, including Apple, from seeing all of your browsing data, Apple says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5XAFp"&gt;The burner email feature, called Hide My Email, lets you create single-use email addresses that will forward to your actual account; that way, you can provide a junk email to a service you don’t trust in case it starts spamming you. Apple already offers a similar feature through Sign In With Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOfF98"&gt;Apple will also include unlimited storage for video from HomeKit-enabled home security cameras. You currently need to pay for at least 200GB of iCloud storage to record video from one camera, and you need to pay for a higher tier to support more streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNFqoz"&gt;The features are all supposed to be included with existing iCloud plans at no additional cost. Apple didn’t say if the feature would be available through its cheapest plans, though, which don’t currently support HomeKit video storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A laptop with the Digital Legacy screen pulled up. The page explains how to access data from another person’s account, saying that you need an access key. A smartphone has a screen pulled up saying “Request access” and that you will need to provide a copy of a death certificate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jDAQ4Q3qs9PM__wWn7lT2ThR_N4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643272/lcimg_3f636f4a_b117_4181_b27e_f468b53a991d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Digital Legacy feature for iCloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2uymdJ"&gt;Apple is also introducing new features to help manage your iCloud account. There’s a new recovery feature that allows Apple to message security codes to your friends or family if your own device is lost. There’s also a “Digital Legacy” program that lets you choose who can access your files after you die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeEYJB"&gt;Unfortunately, Apple didn’t announce the iCloud update we were all hoping for: a free storage tier that starts above a paltry 5GB. Maybe next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhzBTG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 7th, 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Apple on why it is not calling Private Relay a VPN&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
