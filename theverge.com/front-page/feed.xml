    <title>Russian hackers reportedly attacked GOP computer systems</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvWhrV"&gt;Russian state hackers affiliated with the group Cozy Bear were reportedly behind an attack last week on Synnex, a contractor that provides IT services for the Republican National Committee (RNC), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The attack may have exposed the organization’s information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLvpgG"&gt;When asked by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;a spokesperson for the RNC denied the organization’s systems had been hacked, but confirmed that one of its IT providers Synnex, had been exposed. The RNC provided the following statement in reference to the attack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hLZvbb"&gt;Over the weekend, we were informed that Synnex, a third party provider, had been breached. We immediately blocked all access from Synnex accounts to our cloud environment. Our team worked with Microsoft to conduct a review of our systems and after a thorough investigation, no RNC data was accessed. We will continue to work with Microsoft, as well as federal law enforcement officials on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fQkwN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.synnex.com/news/press-release-details/2021/SYNNEX-Responds-to-Recent-Cybersecurity-Attacks-and-Media-Mentions/default.aspx"&gt;In a statement released on July 6th&lt;/a&gt;, Synnex further confirmed “it is aware of a few instances where outside actors have attempted to gain access, through Synnex, to customer applications within the Microsoft cloud environment.” The company claims it is reviewing the attack alongside Microsoft and a third-party security firm. Manipulating enterprise software that interacts with Microsoft’s cloud rather than going after Azure or Office products directly shares some similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;the SolarWinds hack in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXnVJ4"&gt;And that connection would make sense: members of Cozy Bear working with SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html"&gt;are largely suspected to be behind the manipulation of the SolarWinds software for illegal ends&lt;/a&gt;. The SolarWinds breach potentially exposed information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;from over a hundred companies and government organizations&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;compromised the tools of cybersecurity companies&lt;/a&gt; designed to prevent these kinds of attacks, like FireEye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOXGHD"&gt;There’s also parallels to draw between a breach of the RNC and the hack of the Democratic National Committee and Hilary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. That breach, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12259258/wikileaks-leaked-democratic-national-committee-emails-personal-information"&gt;the leak of thousands of emails on WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568660/russia-dnc-hack-indictments-gru-mueller-guccifer-dcleaks"&gt;the indictment of 12 members of GRU&lt;/a&gt;, a Russian military intelligence agency with connections to another group of ursine-inspired Russian hackers called Fancy Bear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CngieM"&gt;The RNC attack arrives among a flurry of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and companies in the US. The list is long, but in the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;insurance provider CNA&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;IT software provider Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, have all been the victims of ransomware attacks. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests Cozy Bear’s attack could have used these ransomware hacks as a kind of cover, and even if they didn’t, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763608/microsoft-russia-election-hack-gru-phishing"&gt;attacking political targets is an ongoing problem&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t always end in a dramatic leak.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft issues emergency Windows patch to fix critical ‘PrintNightmare’ vulnerability</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ztCMQtMSzjjbES4NsAzCbqtpmik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548401/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pSKaLh"&gt;Microsoft has started rolling out an emergency Windows patch to address a critical flaw in the Windows Print Spooler service. The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560435/microsoft-printnightmare-windows-print-spooler-service-vulnerability-exploit-0-day"&gt;dubbed PrintNightmare&lt;/a&gt;, was revealed last week, after security researchers accidentally published proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code. Microsoft has issued &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527"&gt;out-of-band security updates&lt;/a&gt; to address the flaw, and has rated it as critical as attackers can remotely execute code with system-level privileges on affected machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYsi0z"&gt;As the Print Spooler service runs by default on Windows, Microsoft has had to issue patches for Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2008, Windows 8.1, Windows RT 8.1, and a variety of supported versions of Windows 10. Microsoft has even taken the unusual step of issuing patches for Windows 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065122/microsoft-windows-7-end-of-support-lifecycle-millions-pcs"&gt;officially went out of support last year&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has not yet issued patches for Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 10 Version 1607, though. Microsoft says “security updates for these versions of Windows will be released soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiHdo3"&gt;It took Microsoft a couple of days to issue an alert about a 0-day affecting all supported versions of Windows. The PrintNightmare vulnerability allows attackers to use remote code execution, so bad actors could potentially install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full admin rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xy6i3F"&gt;“We recommend that you install these updates immediately,” says Microsoft. “The security updates released on and after July 6, 2021 contain protections for CVE-2021-1675 and the additional remote code execution exploit in the Windows Print Spooler service known as ‘PrintNightmare’, documented in CVE-2021-34527.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjYughWEFUARdUXTjCu3rO0RBrw=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548349/switch_oled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YD4F1B"&gt;The Nintendo Switch is&lt;em&gt; fine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;Like Alex says&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no pressing reason for Nintendo to replace it right now. But does that mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;today’s new OLED variant&lt;/a&gt; has utterly dashed our dreams of a more powerful Switch Pro, one that might play games like &lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Hyrule Warriors, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Strikers &lt;/em&gt;without chugging? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMkDED"&gt;I wouldn’t rule out a Switch Pro just yet, partly because I have a hard time believing Nintendo can resist pumping out as many models as the market will hold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbCrZH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m on vacation today but just gonna leave this here for no particular reason &lt;a href="https://t.co/qo5B3xFHRY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qo5B3xFHRY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cgartenberg/status/1412453918387417093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X2DKgt"&gt;And partly because, if I were Nintendo, I’d be saving a Switch Pro for a moment it’ll truly count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3ekGz"&gt;Today, Nintendo would have to battle chip shortages and the pandemic game development slowdown to replace a console that’s... already flying off the shelves? But fast forward to 2022, and the company might have a more pressing reason to make a Switch with more horsepower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V2EyXi"&gt;An easy choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxRIR"&gt;If we assume the rumors are true, Nintendo has been toying with a more powerful Switch for several years now, but repeatedly decided to hold back. In March 2019, longtime game industry reporter Takashi Mochizuki wrote that a new Switch &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-to-launch-two-new-switch-models-11553494773"&gt;would have “enhanced features targeted at avid videogamers,”&lt;/a&gt; only for Nintendo to announce a model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;that simply added additional battery life&lt;/a&gt;. This March, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;Mochizuki got far more specific&lt;/a&gt; about a new OLED Switch due this year. One with “an upgraded Nvidia Corp chip with better graphics and processing” and 4K graphics when streamed on the TV thanks to Nvidia DLSS. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;But as we now know&lt;/a&gt;, the OLED model doesn’t have a new CPU, period. It’s got the same guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34KQtb"&gt;You can argue that’s because the Switch doesn’t really need a new chip — and we do argue it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; — but Nintendo might have had an uphill battle to get new CPUs to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfRUyr"&gt;Remember, we’re in the middle of a historic chip shortage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;a shortage with seemingly no end in sight&lt;/a&gt;, where giant companies are buying up all the chip-building capacity they can from an incredibly small number of players that actually produce the silicon. TSMC, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-relies-on-one-chip-maker-in-taiwan-leaving-everyone-vulnerable-11624075400?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;which reportedly produces&lt;/a&gt; 92 percent of the world’s cutting-edge chips (and as much as 60 percent of the rest) is &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/22/tsmc-to-prioritize-apple-and-automaker-silicon-orders-as-global-semiconductor-shortage-continues/"&gt;said to be prioritizing Apple and hard-hit automakers&lt;/a&gt; over other firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kGEIv4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KakcPi"&gt;Even if Nvidia designed a new Tegra processor, built some sample parts, and Nintendo designed a new Switch Pro around it, that doesn’t mean Nintendo’s suppliers could necessarily produce the chips — particularly not at the quantities you’d need to meet demand and fill store shelves. There could be dire Switch Pro shortages, not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;the shortages we’ve been seeing&lt;/a&gt; for the PS5, Xbox Series X, and every single decent Nvidia and AMD graphics card now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnVNzq"&gt;But Nintendo doesn’t need to fight for additional capacity if it sticks with today’s Nvidia Tegra chips. It just needs TSMC to keep the existing chips coming, where it’s already got quite a bit of capacity: the production lines now provide enough chips for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;over 28 million consoles a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PRbVl"&gt;Besides, while Nintendo has successfully surfed shortage waves in the past to drum up tremendous sales (most famously with the Nintendo Wii but also the early Switch), a Switch Pro shortage might hurt more than it helps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzLMiK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Don’t rock the boat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pvnanp"&gt;The existing Nintendo Switch has been the best-selling console in the US &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/06/nintendo_switch_has_been_the_us_best-selling_console_for_30_months_in_a_row"&gt;for 30 months in a row&lt;/a&gt;, and global sales were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;up 44 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the first three months of the year. Nintendo probably doesn’t want to risk that momentum with a mixed message about how you can’t easily buy a Switch, or how the new more powerful Switch may or may not play the same games as the old one (a mistake it made with the Wii U, and arguably with the New Nintendo 3DS). It’s also not clear if Nintendo has any games ready to show off and justify the power of a Switch Pro anyhow — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; sequel&lt;/a&gt; is now due in 2022, we’ve heard little about &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;since Nintendo rebooted development&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019, and &lt;em&gt;Bayonetta 3&lt;/em&gt; still doesn’t have a release date. While it’s possible Nintendo has surprises up its sleeves, the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;hasn’t made game development easier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoCyRH"&gt;When Nintendo introduced its first Switch revisions in 2019, and again today, experts explained that mid-cycle refreshes are designed primarily to keep the momentum going. Nintendo’s done this with portables for years, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1412409245585248261"&gt;NPD analyst Mat Piscatella explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UAJhaQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Back in the day, Nintendo portable revisions would stabilize the demand curve and firm up ASPs. They were about maintaining sales performance, and preventing the pull of price drops and stale inventory. The Switch OLED is right out of this successful playbook.&lt;/p&gt;— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1412409245585248261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Ip1L"&gt;And while the OLED Switch doesn’t need a new Nvidia chip to keep that momentum today, there’s nothing stopping Nintendo from dropping a new processor into that OLED Switch (perhaps even literally) in the future, if Nintendo feels the need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvDjrZ"&gt;One of the striking things about the full-size Nintendo Switch’s refresh in 2019 was just how little the internal design changed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/5/20755253/nintendo-switch-lite-smaller-battery-new-processor-fcc-filings"&gt;We dove through teardown photos back then,&lt;/a&gt; and the new motherboard and processor almost looked like a drop-in replacement: same size, same layout, same battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVedwv"&gt;Perhaps next year — when Nintendo’s once again feeling the pressure to keep Switch sales high, no longer needs to fight for chips, and has a system-selling video game like the &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; sequel primed and ready to go — it’ll try again. Nintendo can drop that new-and-improved Nvidia Tegra chip into this year’s OLED-equipped Switch, give it a snappy name like New Nintendo Switch i Max Plus Remake Intergrade, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;maybe add some Bluetooth headphone support&lt;/a&gt;, and call it a day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Go is still incredibly relevant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pokemon Go" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dL92dWUh-Vy_lkFbwuvcjvNaIIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548297/jbareham_160711_1134_0036_02.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iids08"&gt;Even though &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is turning five years old this week, it’s still going strong with upcoming events, some notable fans, and what appears to be a whole lot of profit. It looks like Niantic’s &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; brought in over $5 billion since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/5/12102432/pokemon-go-release-date-ios-android-app-available"&gt;its launch in July of 2016&lt;/a&gt;, averaging around a billion dollars per year, &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-five-billion-revenue"&gt;according to Sensor Tower analytics&lt;/a&gt;. The game started out as a viral sensation but has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;obviously had staying power&lt;/a&gt; over the five years that it’s been around. Sensor Tower claims that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; players spent $1.3 billion in 2020, besting its record-setting 2019 revenue by around $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsKdsD"&gt;Sensor Tower’s data seems to indicate that the game not only survived the pandemic, but came out stronger. It’s a bit surprising, at least to me, given how few people I know who still play. Sensor Tower cites Niantic’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178230/pokemon-go-coronavirus-niantic-updates-temporary-discounts-inside"&gt;updates to the game&lt;/a&gt; as one of the reasons for the game’s 2020 success, as the company made it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;more suited to a world&lt;/a&gt; where people couldn’t necessarily go for walks or gather in large crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcUiXC"&gt;While Niantic hasn’t released its own numbers or reasons for the success, we do know it plans to keep adapting to our new reality.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As we move into the latter half of 2021, Niantic says it’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/22544263/pokemon-go-gameplay-changes-pandemic-covid-19-niantic"&gt;planning on reverting some of the changes&lt;/a&gt; it made in response to the pandemic, while also keeping some around and further tweaking the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VvmleD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game also recently got a shout-out from Miyamoto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hjWJZH"&gt;The game doesn’t seem to be losing steam in 2021 — on July 17th and 18th, Niantic will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454064/pokemon-go-fest-2021-music-festival-pikachu-rock-pop-star"&gt;holding its online Pokémon Go Fest&lt;/a&gt;, with some cities &lt;a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/pokemongofest2021-cityactivations"&gt;having in-person events&lt;/a&gt; on the 17th. The event will be music-themed, and admission will cost $5, down from $14.99 in previous years, in honor of the game’s five-year anniversary. The game also recently got a shout-out from Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/qa2106e.pdf"&gt;in an investor Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, with the Mario and Zelda creator saying that he was hooked on playing &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; with his family. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok confirms the app is ‘experiencing some issues’</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id3eZN"&gt;The TikTok app is currently “experiencing some issues,” according to the app’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokSupport/status/1412508896552534019"&gt;support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in a post at 4:28PM ET. The app’s team is “working quickly to address” the problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iImJ0g"&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, I wasn’t able to log in to the app on either the web or my phone. When I tried, I got this message, which felt like it was downplaying the issue: “There is a small problem with the server, fixing it now.” Now, I am able to log in and use the iOS app as normal, but I can’t log in on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6yn5YC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The TikTok app is currently experiencing some issues, which our team is working quickly to address. Thank you for your patience!&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokSupport (@TikTokSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokSupport/status/1412508896552534019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cHgXoK"&gt;While the problems seem to have somewhat been resolved, they earlier appeared to be fairly widespread, with more than 40,000 user reports of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/tiktok/"&gt;on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOFhZw"&gt;There are also many people on Twitter still posting using the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tiktokdown?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#tiktokdown hashtag&lt;/a&gt;. I gotta say, the memes on this hashtag are pretty good — if you’re looking for something to do instead of hang out on TikTok, scrolling the Twitter posts about the service being down might be a fun alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHD4s6"&gt;TikTok hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSLpCl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 6th, 6:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: TikTok seems to be recovering, but it is still experiencing some issues. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal and DreamWorks films to exclusively hit Peacock within four months of theatrical releases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cik6FElLntTxGPSb0PD2qynosmI=/49x0:951x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547838/peacock.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XxzPQc"&gt;Beginning next year, Universal theatrical releases will head to Peacock as exclusives no later than four months after they premiere in cinemas — a clear bid to win over subscribers who may have missed the studio’s flicks on the silver screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZbDrT"&gt;The multi-year deal will see not only Universal titles but films from DreamWorks, Illumination, and Focus Films as well. As part of the agreement, titles will head to Peacock for the first four months as well as the last four months of the traditional 18-month pay-one window, the companies announced Tuesday. (Pay-one refers to the agreements between services and studios for first rights to stream films and content after their initial release.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmnmOQ"&gt;Universal’s 2022 film roster includes some highly anticipated releases. A spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that all Universal Filmed Entertainment Group releases next year — including &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Dominion&lt;/em&gt;, an untitled Jordan Peele horror film, &lt;em&gt;Minions: The Rise of Gru&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish &lt;/em&gt;— will hit Peacock no later than four months after their cinema releases as part of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9g5fmS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DreamWorks, Illumination, and Focus Films productions will also be included as part of the agreement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc2FQe"&gt;During the 10-month period between those two windows, the titles will head to other streaming services. This release model will allow “multiple audiences across a variety of streaming services to experience Universal’s award-winning and critically acclaimed film slate,” the companies said. As part of the agreement, which will begin in 2022, Universal will also produce exclusive releases for Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBNMrB"&gt;From the sounds of it, Peacock is betting big on exclusive streaming rights to Universal’s anticipated 2022 roster of films to lure potential subscribers to its recently launched streaming service. Peter Levinsohn, vice chair and chief distribution officer of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, said in a statement that the company was “excited to become Peacock’s first Pay-One partner while the platform continues to curate and build a vast film library that will delight its rapidly growing subscriber base.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peugeot reveals a wicked wingless hypercar </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3atKBbarmQH5vhvcwzMcDNdUWms=/26x0:2375x1566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547732/3115466_c76lrw4ipm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peugeot’s new hypercar, the 9X8.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Peugeot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPjpyu"&gt;French automaker Peugeot has &lt;a href="https://int-media.peugeot.com/en/node/90087880"&gt;revealed the new hybrid hypercar&lt;/a&gt; that it will race in the World Endurance Championship series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans next year. Not only does it look extremely cool — it truly “looks fast standing still,” as they say in motorsports — but it’s missing the typical rear wing, meaning Peugeot’s designers and engineers are making a huge bet that they can create the kind of aerodynamic downforce required to compete with Toyota, the dominant player in prototype racing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BovL3y"&gt;The new car, named the 9X8, is also just the latest reason to start following the top sports car racing series in the world, as it’s a sign that automakers of various stripes are taking the new Le Mans Hypercar class seriously and — crucially — are willing to put a ton of effort into designing vehicles that are genuinely interesting and different. Not only will Peugeot race this radical car starting next year, joining Toyota and single-car team Glickenhaus, but &lt;a href="https://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/ferrari-announces-factory-lmh-program/"&gt;Ferrari is entering a car&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2023. It will be the Italian sports car manufacturer’s first prototype-class racing car in more than a half century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HUUNWd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10639777"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTt8Hr"&gt;The Le Mans Hypercar class was created a few years ago as Audi and Porsche dropped out of what was then the top prototype class in endurance racing, Le Mans Prototype 1, citing high costs. (Audi and Porsche &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055120/porsche-racing-quit-wec-formula-e-electric"&gt;opted instead to focus on Formula E&lt;/a&gt;, the upstart all-electric racing series that is far less expensive — though Audi has &lt;a href="https://the-race.com/formula-e/why-audi-is-walking-away-from-formula-e/"&gt;since announced it’s leaving that sport&lt;/a&gt;.) As a result, Toyota dominated the series in the interim as basically the lone entrant in the top class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JngX89"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new hypercar class is turning into the shakeup that endurance racing’s top class needed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgY71N"&gt;Creating a whole new class let the sport’s governing body, the FIA, address the cost issue while also giving potential entrants a new set of technical challenges to try to conquer. The new class is also supposed to be a little slower than LMP1, and involve more technology typically found in road cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woXUtq"&gt;Still, Peugeot’s new car is a beast. Per the regulations, it will marry a 680 horsepower V6 engine with a 200kW electric motor that pulls its power from a 900-volt battery pack that Peugeot is co-developing with French company Saft. Interestingly, since the regulations only allow a maximum of 680 horsepower at any given time during a race, the Peugeot’s powertrain will have to dynamically balance the power output of these two sources, since they can create &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-engine-that-will-power-peugeots-le-mans-hyp-1845876398"&gt;more than that in tandem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDxq2J"&gt;Clever technical solutions like that are one of the reasons to watch sports like endurance racing in the first place, but — for now at least — the new Le Mans Hypercar class doesn’t seem too prescriptive. In fact, it’s the existence of ample wiggle room in the rules that makes the wingless design possible in the first place, according to Peugeot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyeTGo"&gt;“The greater flexibility allowed by the sport’s new technical rules regarding aerodynamics permits radical new thinking that favours the emergence of innovative cars, with scope for the design teams to make an even bigger contribution,” Peugeot Sport &lt;a href="https://int-media.peugeot.com/en/node/90087880"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Peugeot’s engineers and designers effectively took advantage of this opportunity to invent new creative processes and break away from established codes to produce a Hypercar of a completely new genre.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WtaeAS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook is a premium Chromebook for grown-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URZefw"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22424783/lenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd"&gt;Lenovo C13 Yoga Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;8. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400085/lenovo-ideapad-flex-3-chromebook-review-price-screen"&gt;Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Chromebook for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S71N4L"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 3 is ideal for someone on a tight budget who wants a small, lightweight device. It’s most useful as a portable companion for travel or school: It lasted us close to nine hours one a charge, and also juices up pretty quickly with its 45W power brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMomXG"&gt;There are some other perks as well. It has one of the better keyboards we’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook in the $350 price range. And it has excellent connectivity, including four modern USB ports and a microSD reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0kBcV"&gt;All that said, this isn’t the device for things beyond basic tasks. The tiny screen (11 inches) doesn’t have a lot of room for multitasking, and the Intel Celeron processor isn’t designed to handle many demanding apps or too many Chrome tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kg36s4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10639822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams tries out Together Mode for smaller groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83s0WDydSX57VabwOWK8PsN7D4Y=/173x0:1748x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547452/2021_07_06_09_41_12_TechSmith_Camtasia_2021.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EbIBmA"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amandassterner/status/1410591387184242691"&gt;adding support for smaller gatherings&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode feature of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which uses AI to place all of the participants in a meeting into virtual environments (&lt;a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-teams-makes-together-mode-available-for-all-meeting-sizes"&gt;via OnMSFT&lt;/a&gt;). Sports fans may recognize the feature from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21337326/nba-microsoft-teams-together-mode-basketball-virtual-experience-fans"&gt;the NBA’s use of it during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; to provide a crowd-like experience for basketball games. The change to allow smaller crowds is somewhat the opposite of that and is currently in beta. Given Microsoft’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549191/skype-windows-11-microsoft-teams"&gt;Teams as a personal communications app&lt;/a&gt; as well as a corporate one, it’s not necessarily surprising that Together Mode will be able to work for family gatherings as well as company-wide all-hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEBp0Y"&gt;At the moment, the feature’s availability seems to be limited to people using the Teams Developer Preview. In theory, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro"&gt;joining is easy&lt;/a&gt;: you just go to Teams, click on the ellipsis next to your profile picture in the top-right corner, go to About, then check Developer Preview. If you’re using a work account, though, you may not have the option; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; the ability to turn previews on or off is controlled by your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0weOC"&gt;It being in preview also puts an asterisk on the “together” part. When I was testing with one client running on the preview, and one not, the Together interface only showed up on the computer running the preview. On the computer that wasn’t, it just looked like a normal Teams call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGAPAHrxZaKY5kd8-lcJBcifCTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701739/2021_07_06_09_40_00_TechSmith_Camtasia_2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alone at the coffee shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4DJQUk"&gt;It also appeared to work for one person, for those who’d like to sit alone at the cafe from the comfort of their own home. As with any features in preview, how it works is subject to change by the time it gets released to the general public. It’s good to see that Microsoft is at least planning on allowing smaller groups to use this feature, as it can be fun for gatherings big and small.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS 101: how to force quit a Mac app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-CwgHR_wOY-d-ceXSgL4epemc=/0x34:1058x739/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547450/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_2.08.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTrMbb"&gt;Apps on macOS are usually well-behaved, but there are times when they can stop working or freeze and slow down your entire Mac. If that happens to you (and it might happen often if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;playing with the latest Monterey betas&lt;/a&gt;), it’s time to quit the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu7SMu"&gt;The first thing to do, of course, is try to quit the app normally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="224zXf"&gt;Right-click on the app’s icon in the menu bar and select “Quit,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33lfCZ"&gt;Press the Command-Q keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DdcZYn"&gt;However, if the app is frozen or just won’t go away, then you need to force a quit. Again, there are a couple of ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LYQa97"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner and look for a choice that says “Force Quit” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpmgTD"&gt;Press Command-Option-Esc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGxWEJCREgbEqgl5I-HhcupWLPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701867/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="byeFag"&gt;Either way, this will bring up the “Force Quit Applications” box, which will have a list of currently active apps. Highlight the troublesome app, and click on the “Force Quit” button. A pop-up will ask if you’re sure; click on “Force Quit” to finally quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yedHKjJbMVDbcF4Rv0fbv4N4JeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701870/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XHmqw7"&gt;If for any reason you can’t access the “Force Quit” menu, there is another way to quit the app using the Activity Monitor, which lists all of the active processes on your Mac. To get to the Activity Monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rF7rhW"&gt;Use Spotlight Search to find “Activity Monitor,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4X1teS"&gt;In your Finder, click on Applications in the left-hand menu. In the resulting list of apps, double-click on Utilities to open the folder, and then double-click on Activity Monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications Utility folder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvDa75zQOI0DwTY5DW0vxkRhhz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701873/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.56.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications’ Utility folder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FZwqc2"&gt;You’ll see a list of active processes, which should include your misbehaving app. It’s going to be a long list, so you can click on the “Process Name” heading to alphabetize the list for an easier find. If you suspect that the app is stressing your CPU, you might try clicking on the “% CPU” heading, which may put the app at the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CMmuCURZUgQZz6vrf9_GYtYx94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701874/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.57.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nt5G6I"&gt;Highlight the app you want to quit, and click on the “x” icon at the top of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzaPws"&gt;Click on “Force Quit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can either quit or force quit the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbRG3yXrKPupi5QFry73TVRQz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701875/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_12.03.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can either quit or force quit the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBldLk"&gt;And if you’re still having difficulties, you can always shut down your system. You may lose some of what you’re currently working on, but it will close the app that’s driving you nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="368Xap"&gt;Hold down your power button (or the Touch ID button if your Mac has a Touch Bar) until you see the Apple logo on your display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vFZxsK"&gt;Let go, and allow the system to restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uA3HUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avlTqC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
