    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For college students seeking an affordable laptop, HP’s Envy x360 performs just as well as some expensive competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ntrjko32oDlmo53mASwptA-kbCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19897864/mchin_200413_3971_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series S is on sale at Woot for its lowest price ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1C9hVgB1FGjM8EYll7petwp8lr4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416960/vpavic_201103_4275_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today only (or while supplies last), you can pick up Microsoft’s next-gen console for just $279.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGsaOQ"&gt;While nabbing an Xbox Series S isn’t as difficult as getting your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X these days, Microsoft’s pearly white console is still in high demand. Currently, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup012122/https://www.woot.com/offers/microsoft-xbox-series-s-512gb-3?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_13" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot is hosting a deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its regular $299.99 price tag to $279.99. This isn’t a massive discount by any means but it matches the best price we’ve ever seen for this console. The Series S isn’t quite as powerful as the Series X with some of the key distinctions being a lack of a physical disc drive, less storage space, and a less powerful processor. However, the console is still home to fantastic first-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and is compatible with a massive library of last-gen titles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/1/20/22892969/xbox-games-360-original-backward-compatible-digital-sale-deal-microsoft"&gt;many of which are currently on sale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BCriBu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="G6Hwfq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Microsoft building a gaming monopoly?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22889435/microsoft-activision-blizzard-game-pass-cloud-gaming-monopoly-ftc-questions"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kGw3an"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer, one of MSI’s best gaming monitors is now on sale at Walmart. The MSI Optix MAG321CQR normally retails $449.99 but is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-Optix-31-5-16-9-QHD-RGB-LED-Non-Glare-Super-Narrow-Bezel-1ms-2560-x-1440-144Hz-Refresh-Rate-Free-Sync-Height-Adjustable-Curved-Gaming-Monitor-Bla%2F866580873%3Fathcpid%3D866580873%26athpgid%3DAthenaItempage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3Dsi%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS004%26athguid%3DETq9k2xgFeUvULajDCcvVFd9f8WBYvi8ca8L%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $289.99 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. This 32-inch curved gaming panel comes equipped with all the bells and whistles you need to elevate your gaming setup. The Optix lands in a sweet spot by combining a 144Hz refresh rate with 1440p resolution, striking a solid balance between performance and visual fidelity. In addition to the expected HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, the monitor also features a pair of USB-A ports for power and a single port for data. The included stand is height and tilt adjustable, too, and the monitor is compatible with VESA mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7ojG2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition is on sale right now for $79.99, a healthy $50 off the usual price tag. This isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, but it’s a decent value for anyone in the market for a TKL model. Just like other TKL keyboards, the Tournament Edition ditches the number pad and dedicated media playback buttons for a slimmer design that presents you with the essentials you need for gaming, in addition to the handy function row and navigation keys. It also uses Razer’s proprietary linear optical switches for smooth and rapid key presses, as well as a standardized keycap layout that allows you to swap out custom keycaps for a more personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aeIloN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10721765"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WwN5hz"&gt;Whether you need something to help keep your floors tidy or just a robotic chariot for your resident feline, the iRobot Roomba j7 is a solid option. Normally $649.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Wi-Fi-Connected-Vacuum/dp/B094NW318F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has recently discounted this model to $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. One of the smartest automated cleaning solutions for your home, the j7 can clean on a schedule or handle messes immediately with the help of the Roomba app or Alexa and Google voice assistants. This model also features integrated obstacle avoidance, which allows it to easily navigate furniture and other large objects, but also ensures that it won’t accidentally choke on an errant iPhone charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorc8r"&gt;Perhaps most importantly, however, the j7 features good battery life and is capable of avoiding poop and other pet messes it can’t handle effectively. One small caveat to this otherwise well-rounded robovac is that, unlike the more expensive iRobot Roomba j7 Plus, it lacks an auto-empty base, meaning you will need to empty the bin manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJogxi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989422"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Currently, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROCCAT-Vulcan-Optical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08J4HQGZ2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab this unique keyboard for $129.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a substantial drop from its usual price of $199.99 and the lowest price we’ve seen for this keyboard to date. The Vulcan Pro features a full-size layout with dedicated media playback buttons and a remarkably slim chassis. The slim style extends to the keycap design, which rests on top of the switches rather than around them, giving the keyboard the aesthetic of a sci-fi typewriter and providing a more prominent display for the RGB backlighting. One final feature that makes this keyboard unique is the software. The Roccat Neon software (formerly swarm) allows you to add custom typing sounds to your keyboard if you’re feeling nostalgic for that classic clicky sound.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I had to see these Hello Kitty gaming accessories, so now you do, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer’s Hello Kitty headset on a pink table with a pink keyboard, mousepad, and monitor in the background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w4EvuJXsmdKZrKrGMUgXhDvCpwk=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416958/HeadsetFocus_OnDesk.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are cat ears on the headset. I wish I was joking.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYIIEb"&gt;Razer is known for making some of the best, flashiest gaming gear on the market, from the category-topping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22650400/razer-basilisk-v3-chroma-rgb-scroll-wheel-price-features"&gt;Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt; to the mind-blowingly powerful and portable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Razer Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it’s announcing something, well, slightly different. The company has partnered with Sanrio to release a line of Hello Kitty-themed gaming accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrltpt"&gt;You may think I’m making this up, but alas, I am not. Take a look: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer’s Hello Kitty chair in front of a black background. On the chair are the Hello Kitty lumbar cushion, headset, mousepad and mouse." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gR-lZCibzyHD3nli3wVyghVyEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184801/FamilyShot.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gang is all here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AUNvLw"&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here. As you can see, we’ve got a mouse, a mousepad, Bluetooth headphones, a chair, and a lumbar cushion. It’s not just the kitty herself featured throughout — other franchise characters, including two who, I’m told, are named Badtz-maru and Keroppi, also make appearances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IM7DGz"&gt;You know what? I was prepared to roll my eyes at these, but they’re kind of adorable. If you have one of the various hot pink laptops that Razer has released over the years, I think these should go great with it. Just make sure you don’t wear bright red anywhere near this setup because it’s going to hurt my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FWdug"&gt;If you want to purchase any of these (they’re sold separately, so you don’t need to buy everything), you can get the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2Frazer-iskur%2FRZ38-02840200-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;chair for $499&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Fhello-kitty-and-friends-edition-razer-deathadder-essential-goliathus%2FRZ83-03850100-B3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;mouse and pad for $64.99&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2Frazer-kraken-bt-kitty-edition%2FRZ04-03520300-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;headphones for $119.99&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-lumbar-cushion%2FRC81-03830201-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;lumbar cushion for $59.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you care about boring stuff like specs, the chair is an &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming%2Fchairs%2Frazer-iskur-x&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;Iskur X&lt;/a&gt; with a synthetic leather cover, the mouse &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-essential%2FRZ01-03850100-R3M1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;is a DeathAdder Ess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-essential%2FRZ01-03850100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ential&lt;/a&gt; with a 6,400 DPI optical sensor, and the headphones are from the Razer Kraken BT line (there’s a regular &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-headsets%2FRazer-Kraken-BT-Kitty-Edition%2FRZ04-03520100-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeHelloKitty012122"&gt;“Kitty Edition,”&lt;/a&gt; sans Hello, as well). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQxvoG"&gt;These are all a bit more expensive than their non-Hello Kitty counterparts, so certainly aren’t the best value for your money — but can you really put a price on the meme potential of filling your gaming setup with anthropomorphic cats? Now, excuse me while I try to convince my employer to let me expense a kitty-themed home office. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebook 2022: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="wvBJQw"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2022 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776850/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review-the-15-inch-chromebook-to-beat"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip CX5&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2022&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1hHuvs"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook CX5 is the best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VMPUxM"&gt;Best Chromebook with a 15-inch screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qu3aaz"&gt;Folks may understandably balk at the Chromebook Flip CX5’s price, but it really is that good. It’s sturdy enough to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, and has a unique velvety texture that’s very pleasant to hold. Add a wide port selection, a smooth and comfortable keyboard, and a vivid display, and you’ve got a chassis that can hold its own against plenty of midrange Windows laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RcLGGd"&gt;The CX5’s performance is equally impressive. We never once heard its fan in our testing, even when pushing a workload that slows most devices down. Battery life is quite satisfactory and easily lasted us all day. And the CX5 delivered some of the loudest audio we’ve ever heard from a Chromebook. While the CX5 isn’t a perfect device, it’s a solid performer all around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google denies Facebook collusion claims in new court filing and blog post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXBdURUe4gguSbPjzy7fXSY6JEo=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416801/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google denies colluding with Facebook in new court filing | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wg7Xr3"&gt;Google has filed a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184858/Google_MTD_1_21_2022.pdf"&gt;motion to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; the antitrust complaint filed last week, which alleges it colluded with Facebook to manipulate programmatic ad markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdG0Hp"&gt;“State Plaintiffs’ complaint — cheered on by a handful of Google’s rivals who have failed to invest properly, compete successfully, or innovate consistently — might serve the narrow interests of those rivals,” Google argues in the motion, “but it also threatens to stifle the dynamism that drives Google and other firms to deliver the products on which businesses and consumers depend every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IDI9EX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The complaint misrepresents our business, products, and motives”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe6alL"&gt;Originally filed in November, the antitrust suit has been led by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton of Texas and has gradually revealed more allegations through a series of revised complaints. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883987/mark-zuckerberg-sundar-pichai-ad-collusion-tx-ag-paxton-complaint"&gt;complaint filed last week&lt;/a&gt; provided particularly specific details about Google’s alleged collusion with Facebook, including a project nicknamed “Jedi Blue” that the suit says intended to limit ad header bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpRyTo"&gt;The new complaint relies on internal emails that show the Jedi Blue deal was reviewed with input from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta / Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Sheryl Sandberg. But Google has denied that the deal involved any anticompetitive behavior and says it was approved without Pichai’s direct approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idnHGI"&gt;Adam Cohen, director of economic policy at Google, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the new response that the allegations are “more heat than light” and that Google doesn’t think they meet the legal standard to bring the case to trial. “The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims,” he wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z2q0uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“courts are rightly skeptical of challenges to how a company designs its own products”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OEI2Fz"&gt;At the heart of the lawsuit is the allegation that publishers are forced to use Google’s ad server to access its ad exchange. But Google says this claim is incorrect, “and AG Paxton offers no evidence to prove otherwise.” The company also disputes allegations that it has held back rivals from using its Open Bidding program and that it rigged ad auctions to favor Facebook. In addition, Cohen says, the lawsuit is based on outdated information “that bears no correlation to our current products or business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKm3cp"&gt;The new complaint quoted a 2015 email in which “Google employees expressed fear that Google’s exchange might ‘actually have to compete’ with other exchanges at some point in the future.” A newly unredacted section of the complaint also alleges that Google made concessions to Facebook as part of Jedi Blue, which gave Facebook an advantage in auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVaMdD"&gt;In its motion to dismiss, Google argues that the lawsuit does not illustrate any anticompetitive conduct. “Despite amassing a lengthy collection of grievances, each one comes down to a plea for Google to share its data or to design its products in ways that would help its rivals,” the motion states. “The Sherman Act requires no such thing. None of the conduct alleged in the [complaint] falls into the narrow exception to the general rule that any firm may choose with whom it will deal, and courts are rightly skeptical of challenges to how a company designs its own products, especially when innovation creates more choices for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts2WR4"&gt;Google also disputes Paxton’s claim that the company secretly colluded with the Facebook Audience Network via its Open Bidding agreement, with Cohen noting that the agreement is not exclusive and that it “&lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admob/latest-admob-updates-making-more-money-mobile-app-ads/?fbclid=IwAR3dY0kup3tTR1O_1dAHDaKecUUS-aduWQb_W_MNF-7VZVV3n0E55Ryaovc"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; FAN’s participation as one of over 25 partners in our Open Bidding program, all of whom have signed their own agreements to participate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hNIA2"&gt;Cohen added that Facebook participating in the agreement benefits advertisers and publishers. “In fact, if FAN &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; a part of Open Bidding, AG Paxton may have claimed we were preventing a rival from accessing our products and depriving publishers of additional revenue,” he wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3QZbX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Lb2A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1gphO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employees at Activision studio Raven Software formally organize union</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVCmCm"&gt;After five weeks of striking, the QA testers at Raven Software, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, have formed one of the first unions in a AAA game publisher. The union, known as the &lt;a href="https://gameworkersalliance.com/"&gt;Game Workers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, was formed in association with the&lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/"&gt; Communications Workers of America (CWA)&lt;/a&gt;, a labor union that represents telecommunications and digital media workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7PJhN"&gt;Back in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;12 QA workers were laid off&lt;/a&gt;, sparking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;a walkout&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; support studio. Since then, some members of the QA department engaged in a sustained strike at Raven Software, prompting the creation of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826129/activision-blizzard-employees-create-strike-fund-while-taking-steps-toward-unionization"&gt;GoFundMe to support the striking members&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szatzy"&gt;“We formed the Game Workers Alliance (CWA) because my colleagues and I want to have our voices heard,” said Brent Reel, a QA lead at Raven, in a CWA press release. The union is asking for formal recognition from parent company Activision Blizzard, who, in recent SEC filings related to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;pending acquisition by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-01-19-activision-blizzard-tells-sec-its-unaware-of-employee-strike"&gt;failed to acknowledge&lt;/a&gt; that a strike was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUij2o"&gt;Activision Blizzard has also been engaged in alleged union-busting activities, with executives imploring workers to “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter"&gt;consider the consequences&lt;/a&gt;” of signing union authorization cards. Elsewhere in Activision Blizzard, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Treyarch recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1467936015071559683"&gt;converted all contract employees to full-time positions&lt;/a&gt;, prompting questions as to why Raven Software could not do similarly. The formation of the union comes a week before the formal termination of the laid-off workers was to take place on January 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nly4oe"&gt;Rich George, senior director of game communications at Activision Blizzard, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ld1cT4"&gt;“Activision Blizzard is carefully reviewing the request for voluntary recognition from the CWA, which seeks to organize around three dozen of the company’s nearly 10,000 employees. While we believe that a direct relationship between the company and its team members delivers the strongest workforce opportunities, we deeply respect the rights of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpE185"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK"&gt;A Better ABK&lt;/a&gt;, an Activision Blizzard employee advocacy group, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1484563155464462342"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are so incredibly excited for our allies at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreGWA"&gt;@WeAreGWA&lt;/a&gt;. It has taken months of meticulous planning and careful work to get where we are today, but we couldn’t have done it without each other. Thank you to everyone who has publicly supported us and stay tuned. We’re not done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTt0eY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4EjyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkKxsA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGdPx6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdzOjp"&gt;With the rise of the Omicron variant, we’ve been urged to use COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to make sure that we don’t spread the virus to friends and family. However, it’s been very difficult to follow that suggestion, what with long lines at COVID testing stations and high prices for home kits — when you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euZO1K"&gt;To try to alleviate this situation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;the US federal government has created a website&lt;/a&gt; where you can order four free rapid test kits per month per household. While the site was scheduled to officially open Wednesday, January 19th, it started taking names and addresses a day early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRPiGo"&gt;It’s extremely simple to put in your order. You will not need to submit a credit card or any other financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HeKtVl"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov/"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSN8FP"&gt;Tap on the button reading “Order Free At-Home Tests.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1XuoG7"&gt;If you don’t see the button for any reason, you can go directly to the USPS site (which is where the button would send you anyway) at &lt;a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits"&gt;special.usps.com/testkits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DLzP1J"&gt;Fill in your name, email address (if you want to receive notifications), and shipping address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egN7Sd"&gt;Click on the green “Check Out Now” button — and you’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWK2i6OSwH_RhFwxKvSiPp2A0Gs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177189/Screen_Shot_2022_01_18_at_1.34.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNKDCC"&gt;So far, we haven’t had any reports of problems with the site itself, although (as can be imagined), it’s highly popular. (According to the site &lt;a href="http://analytics.usa.gov"&gt;analytics.usa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, as of 2PM on Tuesday, January 18th, over 700,000 people had already visited the website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a05RJ0"&gt;There is now also a phone number if you have difficulty accessing the internet or have any problems placing an order: 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQEAia"&gt;The kits are supposed to ship within 7–12 days, starting in late January. Until then, as far as rapid tests are concerned, we’re still on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQTbBP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;Some apartment dwellers are reporting problems with putting in an order if somebody else in their building already did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BLXfsZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Houston, we have a problem!  People at same street address but different apartment numbers are being refused free COVID test kits at &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS"&gt;https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS&lt;/a&gt; if another apartment dweller ordered first.  This happened to me and I’m not the only one. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USPS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#USPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidTesting?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CovidTesting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZllXT7m6jq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZllXT7m6jq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicky Sundt (@NickySundt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickySundt/status/1483521702315405315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KBv29U"&gt;There have been a number of solutions suggested if this happens to you, including putting your apartment number on the same line as your street address, putting your apartment number on the second address line, or using a word (such as “suite” or “apartment”) rather than a hash sign. None of these have been verified; we’ll let you know if we hear anything further. Meanwhile, if you’re having problems, you can try the 800 number mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Microsoft to acquire Activision,  Google building a headset, and the 5G battle with airlines</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uk013"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kb4LEK"&gt;The biggest news in tech this week was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft acquiring game publisher Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for $68.7 billion. On today’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with games reporter Ash Parrish and senior reporter Alex Heath about the acquisition, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the issues behind the culture&lt;/a&gt; at Activision Blizzard, and what this means for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889457/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-mobile-gaming-candy-crush"&gt;gaming space in the future. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jt0c8k"&gt;The crew also discusses Alex’s scoop this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892152/google-project-iris-ar-headset-2024"&gt;Google is building an AR headset&lt;/a&gt;, internally codenamed Project Iris, that it hopes to ship in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V52eo3"&gt;Later in the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;policy editor Russell Brandom joins to discuss the ongoing battle between the FAA, AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and airlines over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;activating 5G towers around airports&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893641/antitrust-big-tech-reform-amazon-google-apple-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;tech antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt; developing in Congress this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Beats Fit Pro get their first major discount and drop to $153 (update: no longer available)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQEt-_8D2BkuiFz7ldNZ8js-RGg=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416262/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro come in black, gray, white, and pink. Today’s deal is on the black and white colorways.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vc0Erx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 1:05PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro deals at both Amazon and Walmart are no longer available at this time. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAAegS"&gt;Time and time again, we see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"&gt;Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless earbuds getting frequent discounts and deals&lt;/a&gt;. In general, if you want to buy any pair of true wireless earbuds — with active noise cancellation or without — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"&gt;you should be able to find a deal somewhere&lt;/a&gt;. One holdout that has been elusive up to now was the Beats Fit Pro. These latest models from Apple-owned Beats came out in late 2021 and surprised us with how good they are — even besting the AirPods Pro in the sound quality department. They have held steady at their $199.99 price point the whole time, but now they finally see a discount of about $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hePsYN"&gt;Today, you can pick up the Beats Fit Pro on sale from Amazon and Walmart. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has both black and white colorways for $153.11&lt;/a&gt; (add it to your cart to see the price), while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Fit-Pro-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Beats-Black%2F232379973&amp;amp;subid1=beatsfitprobreakout012122" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart has the black model matched at the same price&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has the white model on sale, but its discount is not as sizable. The funkier gray and purple colors remain at full price, but nothing beats black and white in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNqYcD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TESug6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;In our review of the Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Welch found the wing tips to be comfortable over long listening sessions — offering a more secure fit than the AirPods Pro. The sound quality is excellent, and the active noise cancellation and transparency mode are of the same caliber you expect from Apple and the AirPods Pro. The biggest caveats of these earbuds are their more limited functionality with Android phones and their lack of wireless charging. You have to plug the case in via USB-C, which is still nice to have in lieu of a Lightning port. At this discounted price, it’s easier to overlook these flaws, and if you use Apple products, you get all the conveniences of the H1 chip and deeper OS integration and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwwFyhC7ZPVVKpAaM-7gBbzqu-g=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414132/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WA4EOF"&gt;For the launch of Samsung’s next flagship smartphones — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we think — the Korean electronics giant will once again let you signal your intent to buy its phones &lt;em&gt;before they’re even announced&lt;/em&gt;, much less go on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq7k0V"&gt;So if you’re the kind of person who absolutely &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; the new Samsung handset before anyone else (except influencers, journalists, and the like), you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsVu5GbT1T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this page at Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt; to reserve a preorder for one of these unannounced phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVcCO"&gt;If it’s anything like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335591/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-preorder-reserve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t need to plunk down a virtual wad of cash just yet — you’re simply reserving a slot to order the phone later, typically after the company’s actual smartphone keynote (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coming February, the company just confirmed&lt;/a&gt;) ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C1x8wX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung confirms February Unpacked, hints at the end of the Note line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vZ4vx5"&gt;Like before, you’ll also get $50 of credit towards other Samsung Galaxy products when you preorder, so maybe there’s a free case or charger in your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LEQb1"&gt;While we don’t have official details on what the new phones are quite yet, they have leaked fairly extensively as usual, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, in particular, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expected to effectively be the new Galaxy Note, stylus and all&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung mobile president TM Roh threw some gas on that fire &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-setting-a-new-standard-for-smartphones-in-our-changing-world" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post today,&lt;/a&gt; too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N8T6m4"&gt;We know many of you were surprised when Samsung didn’t release a new Galaxy Note last year. You loved the unparalleled creativity and efficiency of the  Galaxy Note series, which enabled you to switch from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You raved about the lifelike S Pen, which many say rivals putting ink to paper. And we haven’t forgotten about these experiences you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjUcBQ"&gt;“At Unpacked in February 2022, we’ll introduce you to the most noteworthy S series device we’ve ever created,” he adds later — clearly a play on the word noteworthy — and says that “you will help Samsung rewrite the future of smartphones once again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDq6oK"&gt;If you’re still not convinced the Note is merging, there’s this video too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AatdJO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_kk-AfcbNI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj20J3"&gt;Otherwise, Samsung’s hinting the new phone will have a brighter camera for better night photos, claiming it will offer “game-changing Nightography,” and earlier this month, the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22888966/samsung-exynos-2200-soc-chip-announced-amd-gpu-rdna-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new Exynos processor with AMD RDNA 2 graphics&lt;/a&gt; that might feature in the S22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DNQ7e"&gt;For a better sense, I’d suggest looking at the many leaks we’ve covered, which go over a variety of likely specs, including a wide array of cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AbhmFh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"},{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"},{"title":"Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886595/samsung-tablet-lineup-ultra-notch-rumor"},{"title":"Samsung leaks new notched tablet on its own website","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890937/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-tablet-android-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mjkMUb"&gt;And then, as always, I would suggest waiting for the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDBTys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WtLbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
