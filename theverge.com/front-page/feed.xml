    <title>Some of Verizon’s Visible cell network customers say they’ve been hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYy2soK3rXiuStajsstFeIuJ5qg=/331x0:1081x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987158/1500x500.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Visible&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8JPEpQ"&gt;Some customers of Verizon’s Visible service are using social media to say that hackers have accessed their accounts, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q6y73u/im_seriously_disappointed_with_visible_today/"&gt;changed their information&lt;/a&gt; to lock them out, and in some cases &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q6o4q4/yes_i_was_hacked_as_well_im_making_this_as_public/"&gt;even ordered phones&lt;/a&gt; using their payment info (&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/verizon-owned-visible-network-suffers-suspected-data-breach/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re not familiar, Visible is a cell service &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/what-visible" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;owned and operated by Verizon&lt;/a&gt; that pitches itself as a less expensive, “all-digital” network, meaning there aren’t any physical stores like you’d get with a traditional carrier. Starting on Monday, customers on both Twitter and Reddit reported en masse that they’d been getting emails from the company about changed passwords and addresses, and that they’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dao0815/status/1448026781332623360?s=20"&gt;had difficulties contacting the company’s chat support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYw5nt"&gt;Visible’s customer service account on Twitter seemingly hasn’t addressed the issue, besides &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/visiblecare/status/1448040220318961665?s=20"&gt;directing upset customers to its DMs&lt;/a&gt;. A user marked as a Visible employee on the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q65cdl/security_update/"&gt;posted a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt; afternoon, saying that a “small number” of accounts were affected, but that the company didn’t believe its systems had been breached. The statement did recommend that users change their passwords, but as many commenters pointed out (and as I can confirm), the password reset system currently isn’t working. Verizon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yX8ZQb"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-10-13T01:13:44.362093+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q65cdl/security_update/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Security Update&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/"&gt;Visible&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D0Ho6e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I haven’t received any emails or texts from the company about the situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9aXBLc"&gt;I’m a Visible customer myself (I switched from T-Mobile for reasons unrelated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;its recent massive data breach&lt;/a&gt;, but am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; thrilled to possibly have been double-owned) and so far my account doesn’t seem to be compromised. I’m able to log in online and make sure my order history doesn’t have anything untoward, and opening the app is working like normal (though I received a few errors earlier in the day). I haven’t received any emails, texts, or other communications from the company regarding this situation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sj6f0YP8i1FoTvugJ7E9tmVjifQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22922737/IMG_2881.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The error message I received earlier trying to log into the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ofVyAc"&gt;Without much official word from the company, it’s hard to say exactly how the reported breaches happened, and what any potential hackers have access to — though we’ll keep you updated if we hear back. With many security breaches, the advice is to change your password and make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on, but Visible &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q53nk9/lack_of_2fa_on_visisble/"&gt;currently doesn’t support 2FA&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, incidents like this where some customers are seeing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Buttered_Pecans/status/1447413221057462275?s=20"&gt;$1,000-plus charges&lt;/a&gt; on their credit cards from Visible may make that feature a higher priority.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trans employees at Netflix plan walkout even as one activist is reinstated following suspension</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifQDrf5naa_aQggrLd67fPdSGdU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69987110/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kjhFcp"&gt;The trans employee resource group at Netflix is planning a company-wide walkout on October 20th to protest statements made by co-CEO Ted Sarandos regarding Dave Chappelle’s latest comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZgGSc"&gt;“Trans Lives Matter. Trans Rights Matter. And as an organization, Netflix has continually failed to show deep care in our mission to Entertain the World by repeatedly releasing content that harms the Trans community and continually failing to create content that represents and uplifts Trans content. We can and must do better!” wrote a leader of the trans ERG in an internal organizing message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9XJPe"&gt;The event comes even as Netflix has reinstated Terra Field and two other employees who were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"&gt;suspended after attending a director-level meeting they were not invited to&lt;/a&gt;. Field had recently posted a viral tweet thread about the Dave Chappelle special, saying it “attacks the trans community, and the very validity of transness.” Field was not aware that she was not supposed to attend the meeting, according to people familiar with the situation. Netflix now plans to issue guidance to employees regarding its meeting attendance policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="leqh9K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Netflix has reinstated me after finding that there was no ill-intent in my attending the QBR meeting. I've included the statement I requested below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going to take a few days off to decompress and try to figure out where I'm at. At the very least, I feel vindicated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lYxemYgRkJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lYxemYgRkJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Terra Field (@RainofTerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EtmH3e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix suspends trans employee who tweeted about Dave Chappelle special ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720724/netflix-suspends-trans-employee-tweeted-dave-chappelle-the-closer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pTrgTL"&gt;Netflix employees say that comments made by co-CEO Ted Sarandos have only inflamed the situation. On October 8th, the executive sent an internal email saying the company would not be taking down the special. He added that he didn’t believe Chappelle’s stand-up crossed a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__9gqde7xl32s"&gt;Sarandos later wrote a second memo saying: “Our hope is that you can be hugely inspired by entertaining the world, while also living with titles you strongly believe have no place on Netflix. This will not be the last title that causes some of you to wonder if you can still love Netflix. I sincerely hope that you can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP8ItO"&gt;In the special, Chappelle addressed critiques he’s gotten from the LGBTQ community — then doubled down on his jokes about trans people. The stand-up set has been widely slammed by trans activists and groups like GLAAD and the National Black Justice Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrZdr3"&gt;Internally, organizers wrote: “As we’ve discussed through Slack, email, text, and everything in between our leadership has shown us they do not uphold the values to which we are held. Between the numerous emails and non-answers that have been given, we have been told explicitly that we somehow cannot understand the nuance of certain content.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces Unpacked 2 event for Wednesday Oct 20th, right after Apple and Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KVR4JRpTmrHFcTSVE6s5D6S9qBk=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986975/Samsung_Galaxy_Unpacked_Part2_Static_Samsung.com.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GKa0mn"&gt;Samsung has just sent out invitations for an event it is holding online on Wednesday, October 20th at 7AM PT / 10AM ET. It’s called “Galaxy Unpacked Part 2,” which is possibly an indication that rather than all new Galaxy phones, we may be seeing iterations on existing ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLUUSo"&gt;With Samsung’s announcement, we’ll now have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;Apple event on Monday&lt;/a&gt; (where we are expecting new MacBook Pros), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 launch on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, and now Samsung’s apparently smaller event on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqhR10"&gt;In addition to the invite’s image, Samsung’s newsroom post announcing the event hints at some kind of personalization for Galaxy devices: “Our users are multifaceted and live life in so many colorful, interesting, and unique ways. As such, the technology they use every day should reflect their individuality. Join Galaxy Unpacked Part 2 on October 20 to see how Samsung is opening up new experiences for self-expression through technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85GIiz"&gt;That could mean anything, but it does seem to hint at new colors of the Galaxy phones or maybe even a full-on customization option. I could imagine building a Z Flip 3 with my choice of colors on each side of the fold, for example, and the teaser image may hint at just that. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21407750/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-price-release-date-hinge-screen-durability"&gt;With the Z Fold 2,&lt;/a&gt; Samsung offered customers the option to choose their own accent color for the hinge, though that option went away on the Z Fold 3 (thus far, anyway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H85ZA6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s going to be a very busy week&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWsqIi"&gt;Of course, no customization program has come &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/5/4588922/moto-x-review"&gt;close to the original Moto X&lt;/a&gt;, which let people chose any number of different color options and even materials for their phone — including bamboo. It seems unlikely that Samsung will be willing to go that far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0UJLu"&gt;What seems even more unlikely is the Galaxy S21 FE, a lower-cost “fan edition” of the Galaxy S21 that’s been kicking around the rumor mill for a while now. It’s less likely mainly because the S21 FE is currently in a kind of limbo where it’s either been delayed or cancelled because of the chip shortage. &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s22-delayed-galaxy-s21-fe-quiet-launch-january/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sammobile&lt;/em&gt; reports that Samsung is still considering a January launch for the S21 FE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veyIZQ"&gt;Regardless of what Samsung announces on Wednesday the 20th, it will have a hard time getting attention after all the Sturm (Apple) and Drang (Google) the previous two days. Though perhaps picking Wednesday is Samsung’s strategic attempt to wrest some interest away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;the Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnDwLD"&gt;Speaking of it being a busy week, we also have &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 year event called &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and Saturday. If you’re in New York City, tickets are available at a &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/ontheverge/Podcast"&gt;discount with code $99NOW right here&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves Thursday the 21st open for another tech company to announce something. Has anybody heard from OnePlus lately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLbaaV"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G4 TV returns November 16th with Attack of the Show, Xplay and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Se2pPUXQYumH6bXHBAPSMGdiEQo=/0x0:1023x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986952/g4_teaser.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: G4 TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzvaLy"&gt;After more than a year of teasing and occasional streams, G4 &lt;a href="https://g4tv.com/g4-launch-nov16"&gt;will make its return as a linear TV channel on November 16th&lt;/a&gt;. So far, the channel is confirmed to appear on Comcast/Xfinity, Verizon Fios, Cox, and Philo. Since announcing its return last year, G4 has put out some reunion content plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22254953/g4b4-revival-twitch-youtube-attack-of-the-show-x-play"&gt;occasional streams on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, where the network will maintain a “multi-year promotional and commercial partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCZHBq"&gt;Though the original G4 faded out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/8/3744200/g4-rebrand-esquire-channel"&gt;when it got rebranded as the Esquire Channel&lt;/a&gt; about eight years ago, the network’s new mantra is that “we never stopped playing.” Network president Russell Arons writes in a statement that G4 “can’t wait to have our fans join us in our hilarious and fairly preposterous sandbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pefG0"&gt;When G4 comes back next month, some of the programming and hosts should be very familiar. &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show&lt;/em&gt; is back with host Kevin Pereira, while &lt;em&gt;Xplay &lt;/em&gt;(no longer X-Play) is again in the review business under the auspices of Adam Sessler. Along with some esports-focused series, G4 has also obtained US streaming rights to &lt;em&gt;Sasuke&lt;/em&gt;, aka &lt;em&gt;Ninja Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, for old-school fans who watched the original Japanese version on its cable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwWbyM"&gt;A new highlight is G4’s &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Limited Series&lt;/em&gt;, a follow-up to D&amp;amp;D Live 2021 created in a partnership with Wizards of the Coast. Expect the show to feature “a mix of G4 talent, veteran D&amp;amp;D players, and celebrities” as they proceed through four campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6Vte"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The rise of D&amp;amp;amp;D liveplay is changing how fans approach roleplaying","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="htFrsj"&gt;If your particular carrier or service isn’t listed here, Adam Sessler notes in a tweet that there will be more announcements as the network gets closer to launch. G4’s new programming will air from a dedicated studio in Burbank, CA, designed by the same architecture firm behind Red Bull HQ and Esports Stadium Arlington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2QLDCU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;bear in mind the content is also live on &lt;br&gt;Twitch as well. We're intending to make &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/G4TV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@G4TV&lt;/a&gt; as readily available to as many people possible worldwide. Plus there are even more distribution channels to be announced in the coming weeks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FZmy8EKq3n"&gt;https://t.co/FZmy8EKq3n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam “Halloween Reference" Sessler (@AdamSessler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSessler/status/1447920041312194561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Netflix is adding the original Cowboy Bebop so you can watch it all before the live action adaptation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_tyR55YNTZj4p2dNrHVzrlso6U=/28x0:1051x682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986898/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_4.20.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from &lt;/em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448060919595126787" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEggb0"&gt;Netflix is adding the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448060919595126787"&gt;original &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; anime series&lt;/a&gt; to its catalog on October 21st, giving you about a month to watch it all ahead of the live-action series’ debut on November 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHihKP"&gt;This is great news for me personally. I’ve been extremely intrigued by what Netflix has shown from the live-action series — which so far has included a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634321/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho-photos"&gt;series of images&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2N-9EmedA"&gt;opening title sequence&lt;/a&gt;, which is inspired heavily &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Go4J1RaeuM"&gt;by the one from the anime&lt;/a&gt; —  but I haven’t seen the original show for myself. Now that the whole show will be on Netflix, I can see it all with a subscription to just one streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="frpIUS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bang… COWBOY BEBOP, the original anime series, is coming to Netflix worldwide on October 21 &lt;a href="https://t.co/BN3LF2XVSl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BN3LF2XVSl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448060919595126787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TONzqb"&gt;It’s unclear if the move to Netflix means that &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; will be removed from Hulu, Funimation, or any of the other streaming platforms &lt;a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/cowboy-bebop-2001"&gt;where it’s currently available&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also unclear based only on Netflix’s tweet if the show will be updated or remastered in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix calls Squid Game its ‘biggest ever series at launch’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6RxfL3Ai631T6YxSzglRKURO8c=/382x206:2463x1593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986799/Screen_Shot_2021_10_12_at_3.32.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9tbPJY"&gt;Netflix’s hugely popular series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713623/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-prank-calls"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has become its biggest title ever at launch, the company said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVXbpl"&gt;The company’s Netflix Geeked account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1448045572200534022?s=21"&gt;tweeted Monday&lt;/a&gt; that Hwang Dong-Hyuk’s survival thriller reached 111 million global accounts in its first 17 days on the service. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; is the first Netflix series to surpass 100 million in its first 28 days on the service, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Netflix typically uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;28-day windows&lt;/a&gt; to measure the performance of a title on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUF326"&gt;The spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the figures it shared are based on the number of accounts that watched the series for at least two minutes, its standard metric for ranking titles (though it has used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924954/netflix-viewers-numbers-metrics-data-stranger-things-tuca-bertie-oa-renew-cancel"&gt;additional measurements&lt;/a&gt; to track the success of titles in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uXyywR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It took more than 10 years for Hwang Dong-hyuk to get Squid Game made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only took 17 days and 111M global fans to become our biggest ever series at launch (and the first to surpass 100M when it premiered). &lt;a href="https://t.co/zVF8GjHIkQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zVF8GjHIkQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1448045572200534022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u3h58G"&gt;Since debuting on Netflix on September 17th, &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; has reached the no. 1 position on the streaming service in 94 countries — every country in the world where the service features a top 10 list, the company spokesperson said. Additionally, the show has held the no. 1 position for 21 days in the US, shattering the record for a non-English language title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukWTCy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713623/netflix-edit-squid-game-phone-number-prank-calls"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; as the first Korean title to reach the top spot in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC’s new headset has leaked and it’ll make you look like a bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m5EM-O7gb3oItoEIJlCr7-eA9uU=/36x0:1656x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986793/FBiCo_yWUAAAbAd.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked marketing image of the unannounced HTC Vive Flow VR headset.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9ulGQ"&gt;On Monday, I wrote about leaked details of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721337/htc-vive-flow-vr-headset-vivport-verse-metaverse"&gt;unannounced HTC Vive Flow VR headset&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to be announced at an event on Thursday. Just one day later, we now know what it looks like thanks to images shared by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412"&gt;prolific leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, who has been actively posting new photos over the course of the evening. According to a slide in a more recent tweet, the device will cost $499 and start shipping in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Afp9"&gt;Here’s the first batch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xZyEq6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Miss me, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/htc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HTC&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://t.co/hB7iPLLCHk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hB7iPLLCHk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448050993158033412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTH5Cu"&gt;Overall, the images in Blass’ first tweet match many of the details &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/htc-flow-hue-viveport-verse"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, but they give a much better idea of what the final device may look like. (And I’m just going to say it: the leaked promo kind of makes the wearers look like bugs.) It’s hard to tell if the big yellowish spots on the front of the headset are see-through; but if you look closely, it appears there may be cameras embedded in the front of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BP0yKr"&gt;The first leaked photos appeared to indicate that the headset will be tethered via a wire to some kind of tube-shaped device, which could perhaps provide a little extra power to the headset (similar to the original Magic Leap). But other images make it less clear: another set of images leaked by Blass shows that it does have internal processing (and a blower-style cooling fan), and yet another set suggest the tube might simply be a carrying case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avPSdZ"&gt;There’s even one image that shows it plugged into a phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PzhMNU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/lnFaZLvNCR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lnFaZLvNCR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448058074896519168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nup2Hy"&gt;Conspicuously, there doesn’t appear to be a head strap in these images of the Vive Flow. Most headsets that people find comfortable balance their weight using some kind of strap, so we’ll have to try the Vive Pro for ourselves to see if HTC has figured out a way to make Vive Pro pleasant to wear without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tfzjT"&gt;The new headset also has an extremely close resemblance to HTC’s “Project Proton,” a prototype mixed reality device the company revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145260/htc-project-proton-vr-ar-xr-headset-prototype-cosmos-vive-5g"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt; with a similarly buggy-eyed design and a similar possibility of being tethered to a pack. It’s unclear if the Vive Flow is the final retail evolution of that Proton, but it seems like a strong possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7eJlLd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/T0m1YpM8iJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/T0m1YpM8iJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1448090431401693191?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="osDIwN"&gt;If you want to learn more about the Vive Flow, you might not have long to wait, as the company will be hosting &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vive.com%2Fus%2Fgo-with-the-flow%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2F22723442%2Fhtc-vive-pro-headset-leaked-photos-evan-blass-bug-look" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an event on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; with the coincidental tagline “Go with the Flow.” Earlier Tuesday morning, HTC teased a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/htcvive/status/1447944104609042432"&gt;very brief look&lt;/a&gt; at what will be announced there — while it’s hard to tell if it matches the leaked renders from Blass, it sure does look like a VR headset of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OigmpD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Coinbase is adding a way to showcase NFTs later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qNSQn3lpdKtcPuwGdf3b_FFvnDI=/25x0:675x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986646/0_fwgVMwxTtDBDuIue.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Coinbase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KU8SrC"&gt;Coinbase &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-nft-is-coming-soon-join-the-waitlist-today-for-early-access-cc7bac29fd72"&gt;announced Monday that it plans to sell, trade, and mint NFTs&lt;/a&gt; in an expansion from the marketplace’s cryptocurrency-based roots. Details on how “Coinbase NFT” will do all of that are slim, but the company sees an opportunity. “Just as Coinbase helped millions of people access bitcoin for the first time in an easy and trusted way — we want to do the same for the NFTs,” Coinbase vice president of product Sanchan Saxena writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KetjVa"&gt;The big idea seems to be social engagement. Coinbase wants to “curate your personal feed” of NFTs and display the NFTs you own on your profile so you can make connections with like-minded fans of digital cats, punks, apes, and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rxPwu8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="llBuHk"&gt;At launch, Coinbase NFT “will support Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards,” all NFTs will be on-chain, and there are plans for multi-chain support “soon after” launch. Besides whatever curated feed the company plans to introduce, Coinbase NFT seems similar what competitor OpenSea offers as the current NFT marketplace du jour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9jUpK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/coinbase-is-launching-its-own-nft-platform-to-take-on-opensea/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, what seems to be missing from Coinbase’s plans is any kind of Layer-2 scaling integration, the popular method for reducing the costs and environmental impact of minting and trading art on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are criticized for the way they replicate some of the inequitable and speculative parts of the real-world art market, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;they also carry plenty of environmental concerns&lt;/a&gt; because of how much energy is required to run the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWGJ8C"&gt;Coinbase’s plans are early and could possibly change, but if another NFT showroom/trading floor sparks your curiosity, the company already has &lt;a href="https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce"&gt;a waitlist for early access&lt;/a&gt; you can join.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charter asks ex-customers to resubscribe or risk their credit scores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NlssuVWZAd7qHeSfEhNDqXtX9aE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69986448/acastro_170712_1847_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QP3l0r"&gt;Charter has been telling former customers that it’ll forgive their debts and stop reporting them to credit agencies if they resubscribe to the company’s Spectrum TV, internet, or voice service, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-10-12/column-spectrum-billing-threat"&gt;according to a story from the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The “one-time courtesy” offer came to light after Steve Schklair, who says he hasn’t been a Spectrum customer for years and doesn’t owe the company money, shared a letter describing the supposed deal with the&lt;em&gt; LA Times. &lt;/em&gt;Charter later confirmed the letter was authentic, saying that it was an offer that was meant to help consumers “reconnect” to Spectrum, as well as get a leg up on their finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV7ToN"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;, the letter Charter sent Schklair said the company would cancel his (supposed) debts after he resubscribed and that his new account would be in good standing. It seemingly implied that Charter had been reporting that debt to credit reporting agencies (potentially bringing down Schklair’s credit score) and that he would no longer have to worry about that if he was a customer again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jzkeDm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reporting debts is Charter’s legal right — but Schklair says the offer still feels like blackmail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhKUtr"&gt;The letter tries to paint it as a charitable offer from the ISP, saying that a good credit history helps you get credit cards and better mortgage rates. While the company has a history of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/29/21157801/stop-spectrum-junk-mail-how-to-spam-calls-online-form"&gt;sending customers an annoying amount of letters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; hilariously points out that this one comes off as “Sopranos-like,” almost as if the company is saying, “You’ve made a nice life for yourself. Be a shame if something happened to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03FxJH"&gt;Charter has a legal right to report an ex-customer’s debts to credit report agencies if they still owe money — that’s how the credit reporting system works, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22421193/credit-reporting-infrastructure-errors-experian-equifax-transunion"&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;. But if the letter was offering no-strings-attached debt forgiveness, or even a reasonable debt repayment plan, it probably wouldn’t be described as “sleazy” and “corporate blackmail,” “filled with real and implied threats” by some of the people receiving it. It’s hard to come off as altruistic if you’re not telling people about the better options they have and just trying to get them to give you their money again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jn6au7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spectrum customer service reps couldn’t find outstanding payments for Schklair’s account&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9ykb"&gt;Making the situation feel even grosser, Charter may have sent the debt forgiveness offer to Schklair for no reason — he told the&lt;em&gt; LA Times &lt;/em&gt;that Charter hasn’t been dinging his credit reports, the company hadn’t been contacting him about missed payments, and that two customer service reps said he didn’t owe anything (Charter said it wouldn’t discuss Schklair’s individual case for privacy reasons). In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Charter said the letter was a “highly targeted promotional offer for former customers who have an outstanding past-due balance of at least two years, and are currently in the collections process” and that the offer made it so customers would be able to escape collections without paying that balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8nGKw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, a competitor to Charter, is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRFxry"&gt;I’m not a financial advisor, but I’ve heard most of the experts say that you should be wary of offers from companies saying you can consume your way to financial freedom. The offer in the letter reported by the&lt;em&gt; LA Times&lt;/em&gt; goes from $50 to $75 after a year — a big jump that someone who struggled with payments in the past may have a hard time dealing with (unless they’re counting on Spectrum to lock them into a cycle of debt forgiveness offers). While trying to woo customers back is standard corporate stuff, maybe Charter should consider either going back to the standard “we miss you” letters or making actually helpful offers to customers rather than a way to trap them back in the same debt cycle (provided, of course, that the customer was even in debt in the first place).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P1khS8"&gt;Vudu’s freemium streaming app is now supported on Facebook’s Oculus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;Quest 1 and Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; VR devices, with a spokesperson telling &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; more than a hundred 3D titles are available to buy or rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKN1LQ"&gt;The Fandango-owned streaming service — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228486/fandango-vudu-streaming-purchase-walmart-comcast-nbcuniversal-amazon-itunes"&gt;was purchased&lt;/a&gt; from Walmart last year — supports both free, ad-supported movies and TV, as well as rentals and purchases. In addition to the 100-plus titles available on Vudu in 3D, the service additionally offers more than 200,000 titles to rent or buy to stream on other devices, as well as thousands of ad-supported titles. It’s the first time that the app is supported on VR devices, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUZ17Q"&gt;“We’re thrilled to be working with Oculus to help transport fans to new worlds in the most immersive formats available,” Fandango’s chief commercial officer Kevin Shepela said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G81nLG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service offers more than 100 titles in 3D&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3Vwuc"&gt;A Fandango spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment about whether it planned to expand to other VR devices as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRf7zA"&gt;Following its acquisition of Vudu last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607391/vudu-fandango-now-combining-roku-movies-tv"&gt;Fandango pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on its FandangoNow streaming service — indicating it felt that Vudu was the clear way forward in the streaming space. In addition to its rentals, Vudu emphasizes the large number of 4K UHD titles it can stream, far more than many rivals (though support for UHD streaming on most major services has expanded significantly in the last couple of years). Per the Vudu spokesperson, films available to rent in 3D on Oculus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="v30fH8"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt; ($3.99)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="Ae1gIw"&gt;

&lt;li id="lGPsiQ"&gt;

&lt;li id="m1OOOe"&gt;

&lt;li id="4Okrw8"&gt;

&lt;li id="sT1eU1"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Walk&lt;/em&gt; ($4.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IUtJAl"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Boss Baby: Family Business&lt;/em&gt; ($5.99)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="pPuuYo"&gt;The service also allows 3D movie and TV purchases and 2D/3D bundles. &lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mad Max: Fury Road&lt;/em&gt; are available to buy in 3D for $14.99 and $19.99, respectively. &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; bundles can be purchased for $24.99 and $34.99 each.&lt;/p&gt;
