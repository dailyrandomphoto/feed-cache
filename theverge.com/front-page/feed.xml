    <title>Jaguar I-Pace is Google’s first electric Street View car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1jvQ-CY8bZFn66rBgRb-s9Lhm4I=/0x115:2776x1966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342344/Jaguar_I_PACE_x_Google_Street_1b.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yo0Hgo"&gt;Google finally has its first all-electric vehicle for capturing Street View. The tech giant and Jaguar Land Rover announced today that they have collaborated to rig up an all-electric I-Pace SUV with the equipment required to capture Street View imagery, and deployed the car in Dublin, Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ii5hbB"&gt;The I-Pace will also collect more general Google Maps data, and it will be outfitted with air quality sensors from Aclima — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9067171/street-view-car-air-quality-detection-google-aclima"&gt;Google has done with its Street View cars for the better part of the last decade&lt;/a&gt;. The I-Pace will collect “street-by-street air quality” data in Dublin, measuring nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as fine particles. Google will make the data available to the Dublin City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ureA9b"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover and Google are no strangers. Sibling company Waymo — which began as an autonomous vehicle project inside Google but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13936782/google-self-driving-car-waymo-spin-off-company"&gt;was spun out in 2016&lt;/a&gt; — uses Jaguar I-Paces in its &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/03/waymo-jaguar-i-pace-black/"&gt;self-driving car tests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtSoc9"&gt;“We’re always looking for opportunities to improve our fleet of vehicles and there is the potential to increase our EV fleet size in the future, but no updates to share at this time,” a spokesperson for Google said when asked whether the company plans to use any more electric cars for Street View. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVcT6K"&gt;Launched in 2018, the $70,000 I-Pace gets around 246 miles on a full charge (after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21003647/jaguar-i-pace-software-update-range-bump-12-miles"&gt;software update increased the range in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Philo is the latest live TV streaming service to get a price hike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEGw9ap7ZzX6LIhzFj1lxXDesuo=/575x0:6785x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69342215/multi_platform_device_mockups_with_logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Philo’s&amp;nbsp;streaming service&amp;nbsp;on various devices. | Image: Philo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezTqVe"&gt;Philo has become the latest live TV option for cord-cutters hoping to skirt cable contracts to get a price bump — but there’s a workaround for current subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ja9dwm"&gt;Beginning June 8th, Philo’s monthly subscription cost for incoming customers will hike to $25 from $20. But those who are subscribed to the service before that date will be able to keep their plans at the current cost with no change, Philo CEO Andrew McCollum said in a Tuesday &lt;a href="https://blog.philo.com/posts/package-and-price-changes"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. To offset the price increase, Philo will be increasing its unlimited DVR storage period to a full year, up from 30 days, and existing customers who’d like to upgrade their storage will be able to bump up to the new price tier if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QueStn"&gt;McCollum cited an increase in contract fees with content partners as being behind the price change. Philo is “relentless in our focus on keeping our price low,” McCollum said, but the company “can’t offset these rising costs indefinitely, and this change reflects that reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMEl18"&gt;Philo’s hardly the only cable alternative of late to get a price hike. Other live TV cord-cutting services that have seen their subscription prices rise over the last couple of years include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309678/fubo-tv-subscription-price-increase-cost-family-plan-standard-youtube-disney-warnermedia"&gt;Fubo TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570259/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-cable-sports-news-virtual-bundle-disney"&gt;Hulu with Live TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt;, all of which currently start at around $65 per month before any additional premium add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4b4ccs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Philo is seeing its first official price hike since launching in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UthzVw"&gt;Philo reported last November that it had reached &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/streaming-tv-philo-launches-whimsical-170000482.html"&gt;800,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it’s substantially smaller than larger live TV services like YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV, both of which have subscriber figures in the millions. It hasn’t technically seen a price hike since its launch back in 2017 (though it did initially offer a cheaper “skinny” tier that cost $16 per month before &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/philo-discontinue-cheaper-skinny-bundle-1203194495/"&gt;the plan was axed&lt;/a&gt; in 2019). And at $25, it still remains one of the cheapest ways to access live and linear TV, particularly given its unlimited DVR and 63 live channels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa0TVG"&gt;But with Philo, you will be missing out on some premium features available on other services. For example, the service doesn’t include dedicated live sports channels, but some of its channels do occasionally run live sports programming. It also lacks local news channels, and its live channels only stream in 720p resolution while on-demand programming streams in 1080p. Philo also doesn’t have originals, though a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that original programming “is something we may consider in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKWLLs"&gt;If you’ve been considering a Philo subscription, now’s the time to get it. June 8th is swiftly approaching, and that extra $5 a month starts to add up — particularly when accounting for any number of other subscriptions you may already be paying for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA for US Congresspeople: Please do not enter your phone’s passcode on TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 looks great. The new design feels both modern and classic." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fIM4IFgjVzP_Qy-U19nbpKnIROA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341948/vpavic_4243_20201017_0088.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jn082c"&gt;Hello again, it has come to my attention that Republican Senator Ted Cruz and I are in perfect alignment on one issue: if you enter your iPhone passcode on live TV, you need to change the passcode. This means you &lt;em&gt;in particular&lt;/em&gt;, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEq677"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I recognize it’s happened before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7yehk"&gt;I honestly didn’t think anyone needed to explain this, particularly since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/11/17964848/kanye-west-iphone-passcode-trump-iplane-apple-meeting"&gt;Kanye West accidentally revealed his passcode&lt;/a&gt; (000000, in case you are curious) during a video with then-president Donald Trump in 2018. But here we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfd31R"&gt;If you are a member of the US federal government, you are a desirable target for all kinds of hackers, most of whom do not have your best interests at heart. Your phone stores a lot of sensitive data about where you go, who you talk to, and so on that can be used to target you for nefarious purposes. Also, since it is usually with you, if spyware is installed, you are potentially now giving God-knows-who access to your camera and your microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vt2AAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz to Sen. Richard Blumenthal after he held up his iPhone and entered in the pass code on live TV: “Senator Blumenthal, I would note you put out on CSPAN the code on your iPhone, so you might want to change that now.“ &lt;a href="https://t.co/yNor7oC2ia"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yNor7oC2ia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveGuest/status/1397283551364661249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D8f884"&gt;I am hammering on this very obvious thing because of Blumenthal’s response. “My life is an open book,” he said. Okay, look, assuming Blumenthal has nothing to hide other than some old photos of him making bad sartorial choices — you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don’t want people to get into your phone! &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2016/09/whos-stalking-what-know-about-mobile-spyware"&gt;Spyware is real, and it’s scary&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nejmnz/when-technology-takes-hostages-the-rise-of-stalkerware"&gt;Survivors of domestic abuse&lt;/a&gt; certainly know this.) If you’re regularly handling important affairs of state, you should &lt;em&gt;definitely &lt;/em&gt;try to make it harder to surveil you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il3GQI"&gt;And then! Blumenthal says something worse! “I recognize it’s happened before,” he says. &lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt; Sir. Entering your passcode on TV &lt;em&gt;one time&lt;/em&gt; is too many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvFmGi"&gt;Look, I recognize no actual congresspeople are going to read this — I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"&gt;I warned about Venmo a month ago&lt;/a&gt;, and then it turned out &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;the actual &lt;em&gt;President&lt;/em&gt; had a public Venmo feed&lt;/a&gt;. I recognize that lawmakers are busy and important and maybe not as up on opsec as we might wish — but can we get them some competent staffers, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers demand company quit polluting near communities of color</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7AOxgGDXM8Y7mSCdYiOjxTjy2J8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341910/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qa8Zu1"&gt;Hundreds of Amazon tech workers are pressuring Amazon to quit polluting — especially in  communities near its warehouses. More than 600 workers signed a &lt;a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/Xsul4-F6BUuVi_MofTP5YA2"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; asking Amazon to bring its pollution down to zero by 2030. They also called on the company to prioritize deploying zero-emissions technologies near the communities hit hardest by Amazon’s pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJCvMJ"&gt;The petition was started after Amazon rejected a shareholder resolution asking the company to report how much pollution it emits in communities of color. Amazon says the proposal was similar to a resolution that was voted down by shareholders last year. Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCVx00"&gt;Amazon’s warehouses have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;mushroomed&lt;/a&gt; around working-class communities&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;predominately made up of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;households of color, activists say. Those warehouses are &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/san-bernardino-county-california-air-pollution-logistics-industry/"&gt;magnets for pollution&lt;/a&gt; from diesel trucks, trains, and planes that are constantly moving goods to and from the warehouses for the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;e-commerce giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AByJ9P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They show up with warehouses and delivery trucks that worsen our roads, our air”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgOF4S"&gt;“Amazon shows up without informing the community about their encroachment. They show up with warehouses and delivery trucks that worsen our roads, our air.” Paola Dela Cruz-Perez, a youth organizer for the nonprofit East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice said during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNWsJB2cTI0"&gt;shareholder briefing&lt;/a&gt; held today. “Amazon has been expanding their operations in Southeast L.A. neighborhoods like my own by exactly understanding how environmental racism works, and choosing to profit from this oppression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFEGjF"&gt;The workers organizing the petition are part of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. “As employees, we are alarmed that Amazon’s pollution is disproportionately concentrated in communities of color,” they said &lt;a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/Xsul4-F6BUuVi_MofTP5YA2"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We want to be proud of where we work. A company that lives up to its statements about racial equity and closes the racial equity gaps in its operations is a critical part of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPL1HZ"&gt;It’s not the first time Amazon employees have pushed the company to create better environmental policies. In 2019, more than 7,500 workers backed a shareholder proposal asking Jeff Bezos to create a comprehensive climate change plan for the organization. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/22/18635604/amazon-shareholder-meeting-2019-climate-change-proposal"&gt;While the proposal was ultimately shot down&lt;/a&gt;, it marked the first time tech workers had used their stock to push for real change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r1sfb"&gt;Amazon workers have led a wave of employee activism in the tech industry, specifically related to Big Tech’s impact on the environment. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/20/amazon-google-other-tech-employees-protest-support-climate-action/"&gt;thousands of workers at Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook&lt;/a&gt; walked out of work to protest a lack of action on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOI4rh"&gt;Shortly before the walkout was scheduled to take place, Jeff Bezos announced he would be rolling out a fleet of electric delivery vans by 2024. The news did not change employees’ plans to protest, as they wanted to see stronger action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3wkDuN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Jeff Bezos has faced a lot of heat for flaunting Amazon’s environmental credentials while his business continues to pollute neighborhoods&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OWhxg0"&gt;In 2020, Amazon fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two key organizers with the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. The company said the employees had violated a company policy which banned workers from speaking out about the business. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html"&gt;National Labor Relations Board has determined the firings were retaliatory and illegal&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iZVyW"&gt;Jeff Bezos has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;faced a lot of heat&lt;/a&gt; for flaunting Amazon’s environmental credentials and promoting his own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321793/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-new-president-ceo"&gt;climate action fund&lt;/a&gt; while his business continues to pollute neighborhoods. “He has an opportunity to do so much with the funds that he has provided out there, although I would still consider it chump change compared to the wealth that he has accumulated off the backs of our people,” Gabriela Mendez, a community organizer with the nonprofit Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcvwtX"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873834/amazon-sustainability-jeff-bezos-climate-change-pledge-emissions-paris-accord"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2040, meaning that it won’t release more planet-heating carbon dioxide than it can capture or offset. But that commitment still leaves room for Amazon to keep producing some pollution, as long as it invests in carbon removal technologies, forest restoration, or other measures to cancel out its effects on the climate. The pledge also doesn’t address other harmful pollutants from tailpipes. Amazon workers are asking the company to completely eliminate emissions instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkyltV"&gt;Amazon does have other initiatives that could cut down CO2 and other pollution. By 2030, the company wants to roll out 100,000 electric delivery vehicles. Amazon also plans to run its operations on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;100 percent renewable energy by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gU7D7C"&gt;“We’re committed to building a sustainable business for our customers and the planet, and using our size and scale for good. This includes investing heavily to build an environmentally-sustainable business and support the communities where we operate,” a spokesperson for Amazon said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFUp8j"&gt;Amazon shareholders will vote on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399329/amazon-shareholders-plastic-packaging-waste-pollution"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; on May 26th aimed at tackling the company’s plastic pollution. The proposal asks the company to report how much of its plastic packaging ends up in the environment, and comes after Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana"&gt;disputed estimates&lt;/a&gt; from the nonprofit group Oceana that 22 million pounds of its plastic waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jEBEIH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government decides pipeline cybersecurity ought to be regulated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="U.S. Department of Homeland Security" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jJOUeP4gvloEm8vxipstfvo6oHY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341678/649149526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NgPfut"&gt;The hack of the Colonial Pipeline — which kneecapped oil availability on the East Coast for almost two weeks — was as disastrous as it was likely preventable. A branch of the Department of Homeland Security, however, is hoping to correct course by changing the rules on cybersecurity and disclosure for Colonial and other companies in the pipeline industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmsd94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/colonial-hack-pipeline-dhs-cybersecurity/"&gt;As reported b&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Transportation Security Administration (yes, the same sub-branch of DHS everyone associates with taking their shoes off in airports) will be requiring pipeline companies to report breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, with additional rules on how to keep these critical infrastructure systems secure from digital threats arriving “in coming weeks.” Any sort of abnormality which could, say, cause a company to part with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;$4.4 million&lt;/a&gt; in ransom money, would need to be reported to both the TSA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrmCiN"&gt;Incidentally, guidelines already exist to keep these sorts of systems secure — following them was merely voluntary. Companies were also free to decline inspections of their systems by the TSA. (We’ve reached out to Colonial to see if it chose to duck any such inspection.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNHszQ"&gt;According to an anonymous source within the agency who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, failing to meet the forthcoming requirements is likely to result in financial penalties, though how much is unclear. They would have to be fairly substantial in order to change the essential calculus. As &lt;a href="https://walton.uark.edu/insights/why-companies-arent-investing-in-cybersecurity.php"&gt;Wharton researchers point out&lt;/a&gt;, the average cost of a breach in 2017 was just north of $7 million — not a massive expenditure compared to say, the price tag for implementing top-notch cybersecurity across a swath of legacy systems; they also found that “in the short run, the market jumps in fright after disclosure of a breach, but in a longer period of time (even just a month), there is hardly a difference between a breached and an un-breached company.” In short: a successful breach does very little to a company’s bottom line, either through immediate costs or longer-term stock valuation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hwVn2g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In short: a successful breach does very little to a company’s bottom line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbxxO"&gt;Essentially, TSA’s new rules will need to have substantial power to inflict financial hardship, or companies probably will not have much incentive to change their lax habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mCzoQ"&gt;That these decisions are driven entirely by profits is nowhere better exemplified than by the Colonial hack itself, which did nothing at all to harm the actual systems responsible for delivering fuel: what was compromised, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;, was Colonial’s billing system, and the protracted shutdown was due largely to the company being unable to determine how much customers would have owed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxVqoO"&gt;Even assuming pipeline companies are broadly cooperative, the TSA is setting itself up for a Sisyphean task of overseeing over &lt;a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/faqs/general-pipeline-faqs"&gt;2 million&lt;/a&gt; miles of pipeline with a staff — as of 2019 — of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/colonial-hack-pipeline-dhs-cybersecurity/"&gt;just five auditors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wow, investors actually just gave Turntable.fm $7.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSMmWn0_-1yoYZopGyGKD4Bg7sE=/0x47:2120x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341610/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_11.25.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9Rsfs"&gt;Turntable.fm, the social platform that lets people collaboratively build and perform DJ sets, has raised $7.5 million in venture capital funding, &lt;a href="https://blog.turntable.fm/im-super-excited-to-announce-that-turntable-has-raised-7-5-b3f676b90c0d"&gt;according to a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; by CEO Billy Chasen. Turntable.fm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313793/turntable-fm-return-two-versions-original"&gt;was revived by Chasen&lt;/a&gt; as a response to the pandemic, after it shut down in 2013. But it’s not the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;version of Turntable in the works now, which makes that funding more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8C3KvX"&gt;The investment was led by the Andreessen Horowitz firm, also known as a16z, which has invested in products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase, and Robinhood. The list of investors also includes Seth Goldstein, who was a co-founder and investor for the original incarnation of Turntable.fm in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwXqki"&gt;While Turntable.fm is being run by its original creator, another group is trying to create a competing revival of the service. It’s also called Turntable but is located at tt.fm. It’s helmed by another former member of the original Turntable team, Joseph Perla, who hopes to turn it into a mobile-first service with a revamped design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="info"&gt;The two sites, however, don’t get along — there’s controversy over whether Perla was a co-founder or just an employee (&lt;a href="https://turntable.fm/about"&gt;Turntable.fm’s about page&lt;/a&gt; throws shade about this, listing Goldstein as the “only other co-founder”), and over the trademark. Both sides say that the other made legal threats, and that they wish the other would just leave them alone to work on the project. The top of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntable.fm"&gt;Turntable.fm’s Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is filled with warnings about disputes and close connections, and &lt;a href="https://billychasen.medium.com/clarifying-the-founding-of-turntable-fm-4fe03bcc7286"&gt;Chasen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jperla.medium.com/i-worked-with-billy-back-in-2011-when-we-co-founded-the-original-turntable-dd5cbc8c0648"&gt;Perla&lt;/a&gt; have both written Medium articles addressing the situation (both with their own versions of the story). If it reminds you of the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spider-man-pointing-at-spider-man"&gt;Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme&lt;/a&gt;, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7piqEV"&gt;a16z, though, has seemingly chosen to back Chasen’s version, which has the original turntable.fm URL. Chasen doesn’t discuss much about what the future of the service will look like in the blog post, other than the fact that he’s turning off the Patreon crowd-funding. I spoke to him right after the site originally came back, and at the time Chasen said that the site only played YouTube videos but that SoundCloud integration was in the works. It seems that he’s made good on this promise, as that integration is now in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeALej"&gt;The Medium post also says that Turntable.fm is looking to hire engineers or designers to work on its team, which makes sense now that the company has some money to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY9wwa"&gt;At the moment, the service is still hidden behind a password, which is sent to users after they join the waitlist by emailing Turntable their favorite song (the site’s message implies you’ll be judged on your taste).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The greenest team in esports now has the perfect logo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJjJTlXA4gWdAYOWJlNFMzAzEHg=/195x0:2306x1407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341598/FlyQuest_Theme_Qs.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HPwsLi"&gt;For the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132970/flyquest-league-of-legends-esports-treequest"&gt;FlyQuest has been on a mission&lt;/a&gt;. Though the team competes in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series, it has steadily become as known for its socially conscious efforts as its in-game performances. The team launched initiatives centered on &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/treequest/"&gt;planting trees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/seaquest/"&gt;donating to a coral reef foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/mequest/"&gt;improving mental health&lt;/a&gt;. But for FlyQuest CEO Tricia Sugita, the process was always a bit incomplete. “While we were doing those actions, a part of it always felt missing,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Because what was lagging behind was our design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="st3gW0"&gt;Today, FlyQuest is revealing a brand-new logo meant to invoke its focus on everything green. It’s a fairly simple design: a straightforward “Q” with a leaf in the middle. Despite this simplicity, the rebranding has been in the works for quite a while. Sugita says the team started thinking about it toward the end of 2019 and then spent most of 2020 and early 2021 smoothing things out. The team partnered with designer &lt;a href="https://claranguyen.net/"&gt;Clara Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; to create the logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WetJpl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is what you can expect from FlyQuest forever”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m7nu2p"&gt;One of the main goals was to create a sense of permanence. While FlyQuest’s overall image received a green makeover last year, Sugita wanted to ensure that it was clear that wasn’t just a whim. “Now it’s official. Now this is what you can expect from FlyQuest forever,” she says. It’s something that has helped the team differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded field, where most esports teams center their image on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268014/ninjas-is-pyjamas-nip-esports-logo-redesign-motto"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;. “It was already a big step as an esports organization to say that this is our company vision,” Sugita explains. “That’s so rare on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="flyquest logo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0SXOoIqhyJMorVl7-2uXbu5OCc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538434/FlyQuest_Theme.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="flyquest logos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbjM4sFX84KaHeUOlU4p_86TPtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538437/Logos.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3xcLQc"&gt;FlyQuest’s old logo featured a lot of straight lines and hard edges, which is something the team wanted to get away from. The color palette has also been simplified from green and gold to a primary green. “I wanted something that was more rounded and soft,” Sugita says. “It feels welcoming, inviting, wholesome, all of those things it brings you. [The old logo] did have boldness that I appreciated, but it was just too sharp and edgy. If you get those shapes right, it becomes inclusive, and that’s really what I’m trying to go for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d797vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you get those shapes right, it becomes inclusive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9k9Gw"&gt;Despite the long process, Sugita says the redesign went fairly smoothly. After spending some time learning about FlyQuest and the team’s vision, Nguyen originally designed six different options, all of which included a big Q with either a sun or leaf featured prominently. From there, it was narrowed down to two options, which included the final design. Sugita believes that the process was so straightforward because the team knew what they wanted and spent time to clearly articulate that to Nguyen. “I felt like she could understand the heart and soul and intention behind it,” Sugita explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmBl7l"&gt;Often, these kinds of big redesigns — whether it’s in esports, traditional sports, or elsewhere — come as a shock to fans, who don’t like to see their favorite team suddenly change. But FlyQuest’s rebranding has been much more gradual than most. The new logo isn’t coming out of nowhere; it’s following what could almost be described as a soft-launch period, which also included some unique jersey designs, featuring everything from jellyfish to honeycomb patterns. After a year like that, a green leaf logo fits right in. “Who else uses flowers, and bees, and cute turtles?” asks Sugita. “We do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside Apple’s colorful new M1 iMac, thanks to iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1Fc9oVwTXiY7oUWw3ybKwopoK0=/0x272:6552x4640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341558/lqgEBjUUFgYXyDRU.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGTmOM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has published a detailed teardown&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s newly redesigned M1 processor-equipped iMac, and it contains bad news about how easy the new all-in-one is to repair. Whether it’s the fans, USB ports, headphone jack, power button, or speakers, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says virtually any repairs to the new desktop require battling through Apple’s adhesives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf3GVX"&gt;Like the other M1 Macs, everything is soldered together now — so there’s no upgrading RAM or internal storage even if you do crack it open. The good news is if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; go through the effort of cracking it open, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says most of the other internal parts (including the ports, webcam, and speakers) are relatively easy to swap out with replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qh_UOEv_1KUeQPgNjGj5E9PPFWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539225/h3ZxqpRyhwlebxWC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNY1Rz"&gt;These problems might not matter right now while the iMacs are shiny, new, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;generally excellent&lt;/a&gt;, but they could make a world of difference in a few years when their components start to wear out and fail. &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has long been critical of the repairability of Apple’s devices, but it’s arguably much more important for a device like the iMac, which tends to get replaced less often than a phone or tablet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called it “the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z1vBML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iMac M1 review: the all-in-one for almost everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yVFrQL"&gt;If you thought the new iMac looks a lot like a massive iPad on a stand, then you might not be surprised to hear that much of what makes the iPad difficult to repair has been inherited by the new iMac. &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; has awarded the machine a total score of 2/10 for repairability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2XaNh"&gt;Apple’s M1 processors haven’t even been around for a year yet, so we don’t yet know how they’re going to hold up over time. But if any issues do crop up, this design could make it harder and more expensive for users to fix the machines they’re powering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YXogD4IJWwbFeDhrxruH5HMhCPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539226/3JkYPFl2Ta1jkuPp.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lydcJg"&gt;This is far from the first time that &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has criticized the repairability of an iMac. In 2015, for example, it awarded &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B21.5-Inch%2BEMC%2B2889%2BTeardown%2F50961&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; a low score of 1/10 for its repairability for design elements like having its RAM and CPU soldered onto the motherboard, preventing easy replacements or upgrades. Other iMacs like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B27-Inch%2BRetina%2B5K%2BDisplay%2BTeardown%2F30260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27-inch 5K iMac from 2014&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F101807&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2018 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; fared better, thanks to their replaceable CPUs and RAM, but these are absent from the new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHVaCs"&gt;“Apple’s newest iMac follows the other M1 machines down an interesting, but even-less-repairable path,” the teardown concludes — an expected, albeit slightly disappointing direction that Apple’s ever-thinner hardware has been trending in for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VTDFrZ"&gt;

    <title>Tesla is already shipping cars without radar sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ngO4ykV_s4xtvRqfTYhumvViVN0=/848x1062:3175x2613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341548/0x0_Model_Y_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hmzcv"&gt;Tesla has &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision"&gt;stopped building forward-facing radar sensors&lt;/a&gt; into its Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs in North America, after CEO Elon Musk publicly expressed a desire to rely on cameras to power the company’s advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyFUSy"&gt;Tesla has been developing the vision-based version of Autopilot during the limited beta test of its “Full Self-Driving” software. But it’s not completely done making sure Autopilot works without the radar sensor, though, as it is limiting or disabling some features on these vehicles for an indefinite amount of time. Autosteer — the Autopilot feature that can keep a Tesla centered in a lane, even around curves — will only be usable at 75 miles per hour and below. Tesla is also only making it available at an (unspecified) longer minimum following distance to any cars in front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBEuht"&gt;The company says Smart Summon — which lets a driver “summon” their Tesla from outside the car, even in a crowded parking lot — “may be disabled at delivery,” along with the Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance feature. Tesla says it will start restoring these features “[i]n the weeks ahead” in a sequence of over-the-air software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4SA2a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has tested a vision-only version of Autopilot in the beta for its “full self-driving” software&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7s74ES"&gt;Tesla is not currently removing the radar sensor from its more expensive models, the Model S sedan or Model X SUV. The company says it is initially focusing on making the Model 3 and Model Y reliant on the exclusively vision-based system because it sells far more of them. “Transitioning them to Tesla Vision first allows us to analyze a large volume of real-world data in a short amount of time, which ultimately speeds up the roll-out of features based on Tesla Vision,” the company writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqoTrE"&gt;Tesla didn’t offer any more information about when it would stop building radar sensors in the Model S and Model X, or the vehicles it’s building in China. The company actually stopped making the Model S and Model X in the first quarter of 2021 as it readied a new version of each vehicle. Those redesigned versions have been delayed, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445453/tesla-model-s-plaid-delivery-event-date"&gt;a launch event for the new Model S is scheduled for next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1hiBw"&gt;Radar sensors are common in many modern passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs. They’re used to help detect fast-approaching objects, even in poor visibility, and are one of the sensors that power safety features like automatic emergency braking. While modern cars also pull data from other sensors — including cameras — to power these features, automakers like to have multiple types to make sure that there’s redundancy. If one type of sensor fails or can’t perform in a certain situation, there’s always a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENsj3a"&gt;Musk has, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451404/tesla-luminar-lidar-elon-musk-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;somewhat famously&lt;/a&gt;, spent years saying he didn’t think laser-based lidar sensors were necessary to develop semi- and fully autonomous vehicles. But he recently started talking a lot more about switching Tesla to a vision-based system that mainly relied on the eight cameras embedded in each car (and 12 ultrasonic sensors) as well as a neural network processing of the real-time feeds they generate. In April, &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22"&gt;the company wrote in a press release&lt;/a&gt; that “a vision-only system is ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnqGH"&gt;“Our AI-based software architecture has been increasingly reliant on cameras, to the point where radar is becoming unnecessary earlier than expected,” Tesla wrote. The company said at the time that it was “nearly ready to switch the US market to Tesla Vision.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report: Valve is secretly building a Switch-esque portable gaming PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gRf_Sryp6F-EcWBrlJ6_SLrBZU=/0x51:2000x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341336/valve.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An early version of the Steam Controller.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQIKF6"&gt;Nearly a decade after introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;an ill-fated line&lt;/a&gt; of Linux gaming PCs dubbed “Steam Machines,” PC gaming giant Valve is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;reportedly trying its hand at hardware again&lt;/a&gt; — with its own handheld gaming computer a la the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWeogu"&gt;That’s the word &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;’s Sam Machkovech&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have multiple sources attesting that Valve has been working on such a device: a touchscreen, touchpad, button, trigger, and dual-joystick-equipped portable that’ll likely run Linux and an array of specially optimized Steam titles. It should have the ability to dock, a la Nintendo Switch, via a USB-C port, too. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;suggests it could arrive as soon as the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blzr6e"&gt;It appears to be called SteamPal, or Neptune, according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/3d8e7591e4464298b89c98d72a6c1b4a697db9af/ClientExtracted/steamui/6.js"&gt;a recent code dump&lt;/a&gt; collected by SteamDB:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0dYbVoUZtzehUD29UqHoZWZfsIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539193/steampal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ3qWg"&gt;Gabe Newell himself also cryptically teased at some sort of announcement regarding Steam and consoles earlier this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZPFcOi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Gabe Newell has teased either Valve or Steam's games coming to consoles in this calendar year, at a public Q&amp;amp;A held in a public school yesterday morning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TbKnrc6fZn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TbKnrc6fZn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tyler McVicker (@Tyler_McV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/1392172423722774528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ip51RY"&gt;Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KevIYg"&gt;Could Valve build such a thing? It’s absolutely possible. We’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;a recent explosion of portable gaming PCs&lt;/a&gt; thanks to new Intel and AMD chips, and while they’re still a good bit fatter and with shorter battery life than the Nintendo Switch, they’re getting more efficient and powerful every year. I’ve been testing an early version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt; for months, and it’s been a great companion for&lt;em&gt; Persona 4 Golden &lt;/em&gt;couch sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiN6Pi"&gt;We have many burning questions, though, like whether the Linux gaming ecosystem (and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952028/steam-valve-code-stadia-xcloud-cloud-gaming-service-competitor-streaming"&gt;streaming games&lt;/a&gt;) are compelling enough to sell people on a dedicated portable, and whether Valve will do what it takes to make such a system succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TeANXc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We play with the Steam Machine, Valve's game console of the future&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Steam Machines are here: how Alienware is realizing Valve's console dream&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Don't buy a Steam Machine&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X7XD6A"&gt;The original Steam Machines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;failed for a wide variety of reasons&lt;/a&gt;, including a lack of exclusive titles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5295632/valve-steam-machines-at-ces-2014"&gt;a lack of control over partners&lt;/a&gt; that were allowed to build boxes that didn’t make sense, but Valve’s own hardware game was pretty strong: I poured one out for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;the Steam Controller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box"&gt;Steam Link&lt;/a&gt; respectively a few years back, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; is still considered the top-tier PC VR headset for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiqruJ"&gt;If Valve builds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976012/half-life-alyx-valve-series-future"&gt;more of its own games&lt;/a&gt; and takes an active role in optimizing for such a system, I’d definitely be interested. &lt;/p&gt;
