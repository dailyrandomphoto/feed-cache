    <title>Big Fitbit update adds Charge 4 health features, brings premium data to more users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQKES06GZdlolc30DylKyVPu_Po=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799046/Fitbit_Charge_4_Core_Black_Rosewood_v2_Screens_Cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The FitBit Charge 4 gets a healthy feature boost with a new update | Image: FitBit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ip8V2Y"&gt;Fitbit is offering a major update for some of its current smartwatches. As &lt;a href="https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-update-charge-4-temp-sp02-health-metrics-glucose-feb-2021-8298"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;Wareable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the company is making new health data available to Charge 4 users and expanding access to previously paywalled information to more users. Fitbit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved"&gt;recently acquired by Google&lt;/a&gt;, continues its trend of supporting devices well after launch with feature updates and fixes to keep them fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrdVOI"&gt;With the update, Charge 4 users will be able to access blood oxygen readings on the watchface, information that was previously available only through the app in sleep data. The update also adds skin temperature data to the Charge 4, which wasn’t offered previously on this device at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PMHxta"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fitbit Sense review: enough bugs to raise your heart rate","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gbqtVX"&gt;Owners of the Charge 4, Versa 2, and Inspire 2 also gain access to Health Metrics, which previously required a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835674/fitbit-premium-subscription-service-personalized-data-challenges#:~:text=Fitbit%20Premium%20is%20a%20new,Fitbit%20fitness%20trackers%20and%20smartwatches."&gt;Premium subscription&lt;/a&gt;. This dashboard shows trends for certain health metrics — including breathing rate during sleep and heart rate variability — over a recent period of time. Premium subscribers still get a little extra information, since their dashboards will show a full month’s worth of information while the free version shows only seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJLuNR"&gt;Fitbit also continues to expand access to its EKG feature on the Sense, making it available to customers in Canada, New Zealand, and US territories. This feature wasn’t available in all regions when the device launched, but it &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-ecg-app-rollout-071725627.html"&gt;was added in places like the US&lt;/a&gt; following regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdJhg"&gt;This update shows that Fitbit remains committed to rolling out new features and addressing issues proactively. It addressed EKG issues with some Sense units last year by contacting affected users and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152346/fitbit-sense-electrocardiogram-ecg-reading-hardware-issue-replacement"&gt;replacing their smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;. Fitbit has also supported the Charge 4 for nearly a year old now, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/11/21321298/fitbit-charge-4-smart-wake-dynamic-gps"&gt;previous update&lt;/a&gt; to add new features and better manage things like GPS use. So while we’ve seen devices with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;their share of bugs at launch&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit users can take comfort that the company is listening at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Border agents can search phones freely under new circuit court ruling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="More than 1 million people traveled on planes in US on a single day ahead of Thanksgiving amid coronavirus pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PSzIARyHOUsbNp4R5AvCbh4Spq8=/20x0:2981x1974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798996/1229742498.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;David Santiago/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qOnUwO"&gt;A US appeals court has ruled that Customs and Border Protection agents can conduct in-depth searches of phones and laptops, &lt;a href="https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/alasaad-v-mcaleenan-federal-district-court-rules-suspicionless-searches-of-smart-phones-at-u-s-ports-of-entry-unconstitutional"&gt;overturning an earlier legal victory&lt;/a&gt; for civil liberties groups. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294856/document_19_.pdf"&gt;First Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch declared&lt;/a&gt; that both basic and “advanced” searches, which include reviewing and copying data without a warrant, fall within “permissible constitutional grounds” at the American border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duCcU9"&gt;Lynch ruled against a group of US citizens and residents objecting to invasive searches of their electronic devices. The group includes Sidd Bikkannavar, a NASA scientist who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14583124/nasa-sidd-bikkannavar-detained-cbp-phone-search-trump-travel-ban"&gt;detained and pressured to unlock&lt;/a&gt; a secure government-issued phone. Most of the incidents date to 2017, when then-President Donald Trump pushed for tighter border security alongside travel bans and other restrictions. But some took place earlier, reflecting long-standing concerns among groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, which backed this lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ULMTI2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Searches of electronic devices do not involve an intrusive search of a person.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mQRCJ2"&gt;A district court declared that CBP searches violated the Fourth Amendment by not requiring “reasonable suspicion” that the devices contained contraband. Lynch disagreed. “Electronic device searches do not fit neatly into other categories of property searches, but the bottom line is that basic border searches of electronic devices do not involve an intrusive search of a person,” she wrote. That lowers the bar for conducting them at the border, where the government’s interest in security is “at its zenith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJriDB"&gt;Appeals courts have &lt;a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/summary-circuit-split-device-searches-border-us-v-touset"&gt;issued conflicting opinions&lt;/a&gt; on how electronic devices fall under the “border search exception,” a rule allowing warrantless searches that might otherwise be unconstitutional. Customs officials are able to conduct basic searches without “reasonable suspicion,” and they can conduct basic and advanced searches without obtaining a warrant. The exception is primarily intended for finding contraband or unauthorized entrants, but it applies to federal agents working within 100 miles of the US border — an area that covers &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/border-zone/"&gt;most metropolitan areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1EQky"&gt;Civil liberties advocates argue that modern phones and computers contain an unprecedented wealth of information, especially if agents can remotely retrieve emails or other material through the device. And Lynch suggested that Congress or the White House could establish clearer rules, which “may choose to grant greater protection than required by the Constitution.” However, today’s ruling reverses a decision that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/federal-judge-issues-historic-opinion-digital-privacy-border"&gt;considered a landmark victory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZk09R"&gt;The ACLU expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. “Warrantless and suspicionless electronic device searches can give border officers unfettered access to vast amounts of private information about our lives,” said Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “We are disappointed with the ruling and evaluating all options to ensure we don’t lose our privacy rights when we travel.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China becomes latest country to reach Mars with Tianwen-1 probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wwk6cO777lO9BQGKm9wJRaSZ78U=/0x288:3000x2288/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798914/6786184.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tianwen-1’s first image of Mars, captured Feb. 5 | China National Space Administration&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tDzHQ4"&gt;China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft successfully rolled into Mars orbit Wednesday morning, the China National Space Administration confirmed. The probe’s arrival makes China the sixth space-faring power to reach the planet. It’s also the second country this month to celebrate its first Mars mission, arriving a day after the UAE’s Hope orbiter entered Martian orbit Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihEOmn"&gt;Tianwen-1, which translates to “questions to heaven” or “questioning the heavens,” is a five-ton bundle of a rover, lander, and orbiter that launched from Wenchang in south China in July last year. China was one of three countries to use a narrow, roughly two-month window to launch spacecraft to Mars as it closely aligned with Earth in their orbits around the Sun — an alignment that only happens once every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="raBP9H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will cooperate sincerely and go hand in hand with countries all over the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yBBEHM"&gt;Chinese state media Wednesday morning confirmed Tianwen-1 completed a successful braking maneuver to ease into the orbit of Mars after traveling a total of 295 million miles. Tianwen-1’s orbital-control engine ignited at 6:52AM ET and fired for 15 minutes to rapidly decelerate its cruising speed for a gradual orbital insertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCa3MV"&gt;“Exploring the vast universe is the common dream of all mankind. We will cooperate sincerely and go hand in hand with countries all over the world to make mankind’s exploration of space go further,” Zhang Kejian, director of the China National Space Administration, said in a statement Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr6l0B"&gt;The spacecraft settled into an orbit that will bring it within 248 miles from the Martian surface, where it’ll spend a few months surveying its landing site at the Utopia Planitia region. In May, the lander and rover will detach from the spacecraft and make a daring attempt to land in Utopia Planitia, where a large deposit of water ice lies beneath the planet’s surface. If successful, China will become the second country, after the US, to land and operate a rover on the Martian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="igysRG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The day before Chinese New Year’s Eve, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tianwen?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tianwen&lt;/a&gt;-1, China’s first Mars probe, successfully reached the Red Planet on Wednesday around 7:52 pm where it will celebrate a unique Spring Festival, following  an epic seven-month journey of 400 million kilometers. &lt;a href="https://t.co/RCzI1qa7F9"&gt;https://t.co/RCzI1qa7F9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8gcCmcXDBf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8gcCmcXDBf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1359488315066511362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JovDgq"&gt;Tianwen-1’s landing attempt was originally planned for April, but the China National Space Administration &lt;a href="http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/n6758823/n6758838/c6811243/content.html"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; it was changed to May or June. The landing site is about 1,147 miles — roughly the drive from Miami to New York — from the target site of NASA’s Perseverance rover, which will attempt a landing on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xO6HY"&gt;With the Tianwen-1 rover on Mars and an orbiter scanning from above, China is setting out to trace the distribution of subsurface water ice to get a better understanding of the planet’s geologic structure. The lander is essentially a delivery platform, providing a ramp for the rover to roll off of and traverse the Martian terrain, where it will also &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/chinas-tianwen-1-enters-orbit-around-mars/"&gt;analyze&lt;/a&gt; the water ice as a potential resource for long-term human missions on Mars, according to &lt;em&gt;SpaceNews&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLRWbx"&gt;China’s debut trek to Mars comes as Beijing ramps up its role in space exploration. While Tianwen-1 was flying to Mars, the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;went to the moon and back&lt;/a&gt; with its whirlwind Chang’e 5 sample-return mission, the fifth mission in China’s Lunar Exploration Program and its first mission to bring lunar dirt back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvgQSw"&gt;Tianwen-1’s successful jump into Mars orbit garnered applause from NASA and the European Space Agency. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s top science official, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_ThomasZ/status/1359499532434825216?s=20"&gt;congratulated China&lt;/a&gt; and said “there is much to discover about the mysteries of Mars and we look forward to your contributions!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s Trump ban is permanent, even if he runs for office again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yw0IusnZcVqopV7ucPz0W6bGzcg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798912/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7q6JHy"&gt;Former President Donald Trump will not be returning to Twitter at any point in the future, according to the company’s chief financial officer. In an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359502706776432642"&gt;interview with CNBC’s &lt;em&gt;Squawk Box&lt;/em&gt; program on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said that running for public office again would not reverse the ban the company handed out to Trump in the aftermath of the US Capitol riot on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGdqyg"&gt;The question is relevant considering Trump’s ongoing impeachment trial. A central question in the trial is whether Democrats can bar Trump from running for president again in 2024 or seeking other public office. Regardless of the outcome, the @realDonaldTrump will still remain suspended for good, Segal said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UdaPiA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"The way our policies work, when you're removed from the platform, you're removed from the platform whether you're a commentator, you're a CFO or you are a former or current public official," says &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TWTR&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$TWTR&lt;/a&gt; CFO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nedsegal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@nedsegal&lt;/a&gt; on if President Trump's account could be restored. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZZxascb9Rz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZZxascb9Rz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359502706776432642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Tj7DY"&gt;“The way our policies work, when you’re removed from the platform, you’re removed from the platform,” Segal told CNBC, “whether you’re a commentator, you’re a CFO, or you are a former or current public official. Remember, our policies are designed to make sure that people are not inciting violence, and if anybody does that, we have to remove them from the service and our policies don’t allow people to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJexSj"&gt;Twitter was far from the only platform to take action against Trump following the events of January 6th and Trump’s continuous refusal to accept the results of the 2020 US election. Trump was also banned from Facebook and Instagram, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;scores of other platforms took various moderation actions&lt;/a&gt; of some sort as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EO9mKb"&gt;But Twitter was Trump’s primary mode of communication, and his absence on the platform has dealt a serious blow to his ability to spread false information about the election results and remain an active participant in discussions around the Biden presidency’s first few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRj0ka"&gt;Yesterday, Twitter reported fourth quarter earnings results indicating it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275079/twitter-trump-ban-daily-user-growth-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;continued to gain new users&lt;/a&gt; even after banning Trump. “We are a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or account,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said on a call with investors on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyrCh0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rebecca Black releases 10th anniversary remix of Friday... on a Wednesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylGZZvLxHhYY7gZV-49deC6SjpY=/0x0:708x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798877/Screen_Shot_2021_02_10_at_8.07.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rebecca Black&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vyD5KB"&gt;Rebecca Black has released a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MsRebeccaBlack/status/1359371627381727234"&gt;10th anniversary remix of her viral hit “Friday.”&lt;/a&gt; Yes, somehow, the original song came out 10 years ago, and I have never felt so old. The original song came out on February 10th, 2011, which weirdly means this new version of “Friday” happens to be released on a Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ef5OzB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kfVsfOSbJY0"&gt;original “Friday”&lt;/a&gt; was honestly kind of iconic for me. I was a senior in college when it came out, and I remember hearing it pretty much everywhere I went on weekends — especially on Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV7GEz"&gt;The remix, which features 3OH!3, Big Freedia, and Dorian Electra, is a bit too busy and dance-y for me, though. The original’s generic-sounding pop-rock vibe is part of what made it so great, and I feel like this remix loses that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfeyy3"&gt;And yes, there is a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/iCFOcqsnc9Y"&gt;new music video&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3zpqO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCFOcqsnc9Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uidY0m"&gt;The “Friday” remix is available on &lt;a href="https://li.sten.to/FridayRemix"&gt;streaming services now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qodGoc"&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Unemployment%20Insurance%20Technology%20Modernization%20Act%20of%202021%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;put out a new bill&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that would overhaul the US’s crumbling unemployment benefits systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFBRxb"&gt;Over the last year, outdated state unemployment systems have kept jobless Americans from accessing the increased benefits approved by the federal government to curb the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Wyden’s new $500 million plan would create standardized tools for states that choose to adopt them. The Department of Labor would be in charge of creating these tools with the help of outside tech experts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VXnso"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many states have been unable to get benefits out the door in a timely manner”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D0ZSa7"&gt;“While enhanced jobless benefits have enabled millions and millions of families to pay the rent and buy groceries, many states have been unable to get benefits out the door in a timely manner,” Wyden said in a statement Wednesday. “I have heard story after story from Oregonians who have spent months trying to get their jobless benefits. That’s completely unacceptable when families are depending on these benefits to keep a roof over their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utTavM"&gt;Wyden’s bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkkE2H"&gt;State unemployment offices are in charge of maintaining their own benefits systems. Some states choose to build their own while others, like California, have contracts with outside vendors. Many of these unemployment systems were built nearly decades ago in ancient coding languages that aren’t frequently taught in school and are widely known by programmers who are quickly aging out of the workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fviued"&gt;Last summer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219561/coronavirus-pandemic-unemployment-systems-cobol-legacy-software-infrastructure"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;investigation found&lt;/a&gt; that at least 12 state systems, like those in Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, and Kansas, were partially coded in COBOL, an over 40-year-old coding language very few programmers learn anymore. This makes it difficult for these systems to be fixed when they melt down under the pressure of requests caused by the pandemic. Only one COBOL programmer maintained Colorado’s system before the coronavirus outbreak, according to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mtif8g"&gt;States like Colorado continue to face mounting problems with their unemployment systems as some unemployed Coloradans have gone weeks and months without payments. Earlier this week, protestors marched on Colorado’s Department of Labor due to the faulty system, &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/01/12/colorado-labor-department-new-unemployment-claims-system-problems/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Denver Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To fix its issues, Colorado launched a new system last month called “MyUI+,” which had a rough rollout after some people said they were unable to create accounts for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wA7DEu"&gt;Congress continues to negotiate its next economic stimulus package as a result of the pandemic. Democrats are looking to approve this latest package &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/business/child-tax-credit-congress.html"&gt;by mid-March&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that heightened unemployment benefits continue through the summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

If you need more storage, Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731916007873570613" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $380&lt;/a&gt; which’s $50 off its usual retail price of $429. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s2PEas"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="pxIjz0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad mini 2019 review: the best small tablet|63300" data-volume-uuid="e735355f0" data-volume-id="63300" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-651" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, or for $530 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;Amazon currently has the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5WFP7B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $559 if you buy this configuration in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get buy it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; for $569, or for $570 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FD94H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J62F1RH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart has the same configuration on sale for $559 if you buy the 64GB iPad Air with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Green%2F968764839%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted at Amazon; you can get this model for $699 ($50 off) in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FTH75?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6FVJMX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7jir3Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nFcTiz"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-120" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the 128GB model with Wi-Fi in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08637NV8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631S3BP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; marked down to $749 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863358NV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration in space gray only for $846&lt;/a&gt;. If you are okay with spending $1,000 or more, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BT4DD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for $1,049 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,234 (with coupon);&lt;/a&gt; that’s $69 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $929&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ffc689de651b8297993943adb5f6d337&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,199&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2My51r"&gt;The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08637TYPT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray for $1,399&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449 for silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="VIB8nV"&gt;Vaccine selfies — vaxxies, if you will — abound as more people are vaccinated against COVID-19 every day. People are anxiously awaiting their turn to get the jab, perhaps so anxiously that they forget to think about what’s best to wear for the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ghx8t"&gt;One of the most recent vaxxies to make the rounds is of the French minister of health. He’s wearing a typically boring dress shirt, but it’s completely unbuttoned as his bare arm is stuck. He gazes solemnly into the middle distance as he tastefully conceals his nipple with the shirt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="alf7go"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;Vacciné. &lt;a href="https://t.co/smhltj74D1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/smhltj74D1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Olivier Véran (@olivierveran) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olivierveran/status/1358735918815997955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Scx9i"&gt;Other European officials have gone even farther. The &lt;a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/01/18/greek-pm-second-dose-covid-vaccine/"&gt;Greek prime minister’s vaxxie&lt;/a&gt; calls to mind &lt;a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lely-portrait-of-an-unknown-woman-t00755"&gt;classic paintings of women&lt;/a&gt; with one breast exposed. One member of the UK Parliament opted to go entirely topless when he received the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WyuIBf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Rarely do they see such a wimp in these parts when it comes to injections, but the lovely staff at Derriford Hospital made it all as seamless as ever this morning, in the latest round of the COVID-19 vaccine trial we’re doing here in Plymouth..    &lt;a href="https://t.co/nDrhhXjCUM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nDrhhXjCUM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Johnny Mercer (@JohnnyMercerUK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnyMercerUK/status/1357622588277669891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qyu3Cv"&gt;To be clear, unveiling this much skin is not a requirement for getting one of the COVID-19 vaccines. It’s just tough to get to the top of the arm meat — where the vaccine needs to be injected — with a tight, long sleeve in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHgDcB"&gt;Health centers generally recommend &lt;a href="https://www.uchealth.org/today/how-to-prepare-before-getting-a-covid-19-vaccine/"&gt;wearing layers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.beaumont.org/health-wellness/blogs/preparing-for-your-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-at-beaumont"&gt;short sleeves&lt;/a&gt;. You could opt for a nice &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/joe-biden-covid-vaccine-coronavirus-covid-19-gets/9561849/"&gt;casual polo&lt;/a&gt;, the classic cardigan over a tank top combo, or simply remember to wear an undershirt with your button-up. You could also lean into a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene_in_Ecstasy#/media/File:Artemisia_Gentileschi_-_Mary_Magdalene_in_Ecstasy.jpg"&gt;baroque off-the-shoulder look&lt;/a&gt; with a loose enough shirt. For the sake of your local health care workers, though, I can’t say I recommend going for full Renaissance, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Venus#/media/File:Sandro_Botticelli_-_La_nascita_di_Venere_-_Google_Art_Project_-_edited.jpg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birth of Venus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vibes. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what outfit you choose, as long as you get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is bringing back Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s Clone High animated series </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1q0ws"&gt;HBO Max is bringing back &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt;, the animated series from Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Bill Lawrence that originally ran for one season starting in 2002. It was essentially a parody of typical high school dramas, but one set at a school for the clones of historical figures like Cleopatra and Gandhi. HBO calls the new version “a modern refresh of the hit series” and says that all three creators are on board. The show is being produced by MTV Entertainment Studios and Erica Rivinoja, a writer on the first season who also worked on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494248/sacha-baron-cohen-borat-sequel-amazon-prime-video-streaming-release"&gt;the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Borat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will serve as showrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KSOzwu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 22 Jump Street directors tell us how to make a sequel that doesn’t suck","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/13/5801938/22-jump-street-phil-lord-chris-miller-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aLo9Xq"&gt;Lord and Miller have been on a roll in recent years, working on films like &lt;em&gt;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs&lt;/em&gt;, 2&lt;em&gt;1 Jump Street&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;, and serving as executive producers on &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, has seen a surprising resurgence of popularity on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uTOcP"&gt;The news comes alongside two other animated series orders from HBO Max. The streaming service will also be getting an adult &lt;em&gt;Scooby Doo&lt;/em&gt; spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Velma&lt;/em&gt;, starring Mindy Kaling in the titular role (she’s also an executive producer on the show) as well as &lt;em&gt;Fired On Mars&lt;/em&gt;, “an existential workplace comedy set on the Martian campus of a modern tech company” starring Pete Davidson. There’s no word yet on when the new shows will debut.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League developer is adding a Ford F-150 to the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7maEI9JaxIE-QwxukVtsbSZKoDc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68798206/f150_core_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Psyonix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xaq8tB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; developer Psyonix announced today it's partnering with an auto company to add an actual truck into the game. Sadly, no, it is not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt;. It's the Ford F-150. A &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;-themed F-150 will be available for a limited time, beginning February 20th until February 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0Sz0R"&gt;The Ford F-150 RLE bundle will be available in the item shop with its own tab and costs 1,500 credits. The bundle includes the Ford F-150 RLE (pictured below), a set of standard and special edition wheels, boost, audio engine, player banner, and decal, all of which are themed after the special edition pickup truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pC9Gzd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10334323"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGru4L"&gt;As someone who enjoys pickup trucks, I am crying tears of joy because I can use one in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;. There is something hilarious about the fact that I can drive a rocket-powered F-150 in the game and do ridiculous trick shots with it. I really want to see other auto companies like Chevrolet and Toyota add their trucks to the game. Seriously, imagine having the Tesla Cybertruck in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;; I’d never stop laughing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Npgr9A"&gt;Alongside a new, limited-time vehicle, Psyonix and Ford are also introducing a new competitive two-day event where the best freestyles in &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; will compete and demonstrate their best moves for a chance to win a real 2021 Ford F-150. &lt;/p&gt;
