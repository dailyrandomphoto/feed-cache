    <title>PSA: T-Mobile will start sharing customer info with advertisers unless you opt out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kI5Iqa2CQKwkctUCqH1NRDzHl3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937654/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZ741t"&gt;T-Mobile will soon put a new privacy policy into effect that will allow it to share certain kinds of customer information with third-party advertisers. Starting on April 26th, 2021, all customers will be automatically opted in to the new program, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Customers who don’t want to participate will need to manually opt out using their accounts’ &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0R5BD"&gt;T-Mobile’s new policy is no different than &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/privacy/overview.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-32&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt;. This is an about-face for former Sprint customers, however. T-Mobile acknowledges in its announcement of the policy change that Sprint offered a similar opt-&lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; service rather than an opt-out one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pYDROX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies say the data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mHh4aS"&gt;The new policy includes the same kind of provisions as AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for sharing user data with third-party marketers in the name of providing more relevant advertising. The companies say that data they share doesn’t reveal individual customers’ identities and that they don’t share information that’s associated with a child’s device or service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppHqnT"&gt;As harmless as the carriers make this practice sound, it’s something people are growing increasingly wary of. As a response, companies like Google are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;working to make their data-gathering and sharing practices less intrusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncN7JZ"&gt;If you’re not wild about your carrier sharing data about you with advertisers, it’s easy enough to opt out of these services. AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out of third-party data sharing by accessing their account’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fcmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, Verizon customers can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fverizonwireless.com%2Fmyprivacy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321733%2Ft-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;log in to My Verizon to opt out&lt;/a&gt; of what it calls “Relevant Mobile Advertising.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is ending support for the old non-Chromium Edge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft edge" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBFmCDP3egTxXtur2-se-G-IJfE=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937630/e1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fo0IqW"&gt;Support for Microsoft’s Edge browser is ending today — not the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration"&gt;Chromium-based&lt;/a&gt; one, but the original Edge that was built as a replacement for Internet Explorer 11. Microsoft now calls it Legacy Edge, and the company &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666"&gt;announced it would be discontinuing the product&lt;/a&gt; back in August. That day has finally come: Legacy Edge will no longer receive security updates, and anyone still using it should start the process of switching to something else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erxDYf"&gt;Legacy Edge was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/8/7516489/windows-10-new-browser-spartan-features"&gt;originally codenamed “Spartan”&lt;/a&gt; and was included with Windows 10 as the operating system’s default web browser before it was officially named Edge. The Edge mantle is being taken up by Microsoft’s Chromium-based browser, which was in beta throughout 2019 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20942038/microsoft-edge-chromium-release-date-new-logo-features"&gt;officially launched in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;. This means Edge (the old Edge, that is) survived just over a year alongside its replacement. Microsoft also says Legacy Edge &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/new-microsoft-edge-to-replace-microsoft-edge-legacy-with-april-s/ba-p/2114224"&gt;will automatically be removed&lt;/a&gt; by the April Windows 10 update, with the new Edge being installed in its stead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="338H3p"&gt;If you’re the tech support person for your family, it’s worth checking in with your relatives to make sure Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;successfully bullied them into switching to the new Edge&lt;/a&gt;. If, somehow, it’s not installed on their computers (or your computer), you can download it &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F9%2F22321779%2Fmicrosoft-edge-legacy-spartan-browser-support-ended" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Microsoft’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GA9f56"&gt;The death of Legacy Edge is bittersweet in some ways. By most metrics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313433/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-startup-boost-features"&gt;the new Edge is vastly superior&lt;/a&gt;, but it does put the final nail in the coffin of Microsoft’s custom web-rendering engines, the history of which stretches back to early versions of Internet Explorer. It probably won’t be missed, given its... performance, but it’s still the end of an era. The old Edge is officially gone, and the new Edge has fully replaced it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 review: AMD and Nvidia at their best</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s simply the best&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q6UuhJ"&gt;When I tested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG’s Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; a year ago, I was blown away. Not only was it just over 3.5 pounds — a weight unheard of for a system with both a powerful processor and a discrete GPU — but it ran even the most demanding games at much better frame rates than any gaming laptop we’d ever seen at that size. And then everything else about it — the keyboard, the touchpad, the audio, the battery life — was also great. The G14 wasn’t just better than other gaming laptops in those areas: it was better than most other laptops at its price point, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWZi0B"&gt;Given the G14’s resounding success, it was only a matter of time before Asus put it in a 15-inch chassis. The formula wasn’t broken, and Asus didn’t fix it — Asus just made it bigger. While I had some questions when I heard the G15 was on the way (could it deliver the same combination of portability, battery life, and performance as a 14-inch product? Could it do that without costing over $2,000?), what’s become clear throughout my testing period is that the device isn’t just as good as its 14-inch counterpart; it’s somehow even better. Asus and AMD have done it again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Zephyrus logo on the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GBalSnXWC5SsSNVk4BZB4khozJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341897/akrales_210226_4440_0130.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gaming on Cloud 9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HWfSaG"&gt;The G15’s secret weapon is its processor. All models have AMD’s monstrous eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HS. My test model, priced at $1,799.99, pairs that chip with Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3070 (an 80W version, with dynamic boost up to 100W), as well as 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This configuration is a step above the base model, which includes an RTX 3060 and 512GB of storage. There are also two RTX 3080 models — pair it with 16GB of RAM for $1,999.99 or 32GB of RAM for $2,499.99. (I think my test model hits a sweet spot: 512GB of storage isn’t a lot for a gaming laptop, and it seems like the RTX 3080 models are &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G15-laptop-review-Eye-catcher.517789.0.html"&gt;fairly low-clocked&lt;/a&gt; and don’t perform hugely better than the lower-tier options.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4mlaUk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10382482"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mRqKJUyaFM-6ibL3L-8Rb_2gO7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341902/akrales_210226_4440_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the G15 has a “desktop-inspired layout” with separate keys to control the volume, toggle the microphone, and pull up Armoury Crate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="I2Jg3e"&gt;Another highlight, consistent across all models, is the G15’s 165Hz QHD display. We’re finally starting to see 15-inch laptops with QHD screens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;en masse this year&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that this is the first year that manufacturers think mobile hardware is powerful enough to take advantage of them. Traditionally, mobile gamers have had the option of a 1080p display or a 4K display. (Not only is the latter quite expensive, but very few laptops can run demanding games at playable frame rates in 4K.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 half open, angled slightly to the right. The screen displays two large rocks with a person running towards them seen across a body of water." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FOls4hR6yunICRTjJJFN-zK9XjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341889/akrales_210226_4440_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get over 3.5 million pixels from this QHD display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rbrUvf"&gt;So, the big question: Can the Zephyrus G15 run games at QHD resolution? The answer is an emphatic yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igOHW0"&gt;Some raw numbers to start. The G15 averaged 178fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO &lt;/em&gt;at maximum settings — dust particles, fires, and other graphically intensive effects looked just fine. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;, also at maximum settings, averaged 58fps. (Come on, that’s basically 60). Ray tracing was no problem for this machine: the system averaged 61fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing on ultra, and a whopping 81fps with ray tracing off. Remember, the G15 is running these at QHD resolution, which is already a bigger haul than traditional 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HMrwev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ray tracing was no problem for this machine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BqvnS8"&gt;Those frame rates mean you should be able to run whatever game you want in QHD without bumping down any settings. They put the G15 about on par with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI’s GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; with an Intel Core i7-10870H and a GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q — the two laptops tied on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; and were just one frame apart on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. MSI told us that the QHD GS66 model costs $2,599 — so the G15 with an RTX 3070 is getting the same frame rates for literally $800 less. The G15 also did better than the QHD / RTX 3070 Intel configuration of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Base&lt;/a&gt; (53fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;, 46fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;), which costs &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0369BEA2-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$400 more&lt;/a&gt;. Those differentials should speak for themselves. Yes, the GS66 has a 240Hz screen, but that’s going to be excessive for most people at QHD resolution. If I didn’t already know where the G14 was priced last year, I would be emailing Asus to check if $1,799.99 was a typo. It’s an unbelievable value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nh6K1o"&gt;The games all looked great on this screen, which covers 100 percent of the sRGB gamut and 89 percent of AdobeRGB, and maxes out at 334 nits of brightness. It isn’t the highest refresh-rate screen you can get at 165Hz — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; has a 240Hz QHD model, as does MSI’s GS66 Stealth — but it’s still a significant step above the Zephyrus G14’s 120Hz display. While the G15 doesn’t deliver the best picture I’ve ever seen, it still looks great and certainly improves upon the G14’s 1080p panel. Movement was all smooth, without a stutter in sight, and colors looked great. I saw a small amount of glare when using the device outdoors, but it was still quite usable at maximum brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports and vents on the right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdKL7LimZF1CZUjZ7MJlVu62oWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341892/akrales_210226_4440_0081.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right: one Kensington lock slot, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one microSD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SJuca_GyJUIYL85M4RWvkRHqPYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341890/akrales_210226_4440_0065.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left: one power port, one HDMI 2.0b, one RJ45 Ethernet port, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C with DisplayPort 1.4 and power delivery, one combo audio jack jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E0EYb4"&gt;Cooling, while sometimes iffy on the G14, is stellar on this device. The G15’s “intelligent cooling” system includes two 84-blade fans and six heat pipes. It had no problem with any of the games I threw at it, spending the vast majority of its time between the mid-60s and mid-70s (Celsius) and never jumping above 80 degrees. That’s some of the best cooling performance I’ve ever seen from a gaming laptop, especially considering that this one was running heavy AAA titles, maxed out, at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bnNwf4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cooling is stellar on this device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zL2NAs"&gt;More impressively, the fans managed to do this without being deafeningly loud. I could certainly hear them while the machine was under load, but it was standard gaming-laptop noise, and I had no problem hearing game audio. You can also swap to the “Silent” profile in Asus’ Armoury Crate software. That toggle lived up to its name and completely silenced the fans, without causing any heat or performance problems that I observed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg6LgL"&gt;Speaking of audio, the G15’s speakers also sound great. That’s to be expected — there are literally six of them, including two front-facing tweeters and force-canceling woofers under the palm rests. They deliver clear audio with very strong bass and powerful percussion. I don’t often get to say that about laptop audio, especially on gaming laptops. The G15 comes preloaded with Dolby Access, which you can use to jump between equalizer presets for gaming, movies, and music, and it makes a huge difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="d5bkyR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382607"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgwXSJ"&gt;There are three microphones, which had no trouble picking up my voice. They also have presets for game streaming, music recording, and conference calls. Those are handy, but they’re not enough to make the G15 a good choice for remote work because it doesn’t include a webcam. The G14 also didn’t have a camera — Asus seems to have decided that webcams aren’t necessary on Zephyrus products. It’s the one significant knock against a device that is basically perfect otherwise. It’s also very odd to have such an advanced microphone setup and not have a webcam to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qifwqa"&gt;There are a couple other things to note about the G15’s chassis. Like many other Asus laptops, the G15 has an ErgoLift hinge, which folds under the deck when the laptop is open and lifts the keyboard above the ground. This is supposed to create a more ergonomic typing position, though I can’t say I ever noticed the difference. It does dig into your legs a bit if you’re using the laptop on your lap, though. The G15’s hinge isn’t as sharp as some other hinges, but as a frequent couch user, it’s still not my favorite feeling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wHoQun"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard and touchpad are both great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77D1oY"&gt;The keyboard and touchpad are both great as well. The G14 had one of my favorite keyboards of 2020, and the G15’s is quite similar. The click is comfortable, with 1.7mm of travel, and the dedicated volume keys (a Zephyrus staple) are quite convenient. There’s a fingerprint sensor built into the power button, which is on the top right of the keyboard deck.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YR48Hq"&gt;The touchpad is massive, at 5.1 x 3.4 inches — 20 percent larger than that of the prior G15 generation. It’s so big that large portions of both my hands were resting on it when they weren’t typing, rather than on the palm rests. This was a bit annoying, but to the G15’s credit, it didn’t cause any palm-rejection issues. It’s also a bit loud and not the easiest or deepest click, but those are nitpicks — it’s a fine touchpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Republic of Gamers logo on the lid of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UIuYOz6xuJIJhRJO1rUtEweqe30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341893/akrales_210226_4440_0093.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid and deck are made of magnesium-aluminum, with a “wear-resistant coating.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The bottom right segment of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 lid." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DXZrmuyJH2spFaGpFZoky9Zp0PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341894/akrales_210226_4440_0098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lid is covered in a dot matrix design. There are 8,279 “perfectly spaced perforations.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cbAwE4"&gt;But what impressed me the most about the G15 is its battery life. This thing never dies. Using it as my daily driver with an office workload on Asus’ Silent profile around 200 nits of brightness, I averaged eight hours and 32 minutes. That’s just under what I got from the G14, and the G15 has a larger and higher-resolution screen to fuel. The result puts the G15 right up there with its smaller sibling as one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops we’ve ever seen. It has a large 90Wh battery inside, but plenty of gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536996/msi-ge66-raider-dragonshield-edition-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;rigs&lt;/a&gt; with comparable bricks can only make it a few hours on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="nhEQes"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The G15 is one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops we’ve ever seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yksEnT"&gt;Gaming significantly shortens the G15’s life span, of course. I got an hour and 21 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt; out of one charge. Impressively, though, the game was quite playable for much of that time, avoiding stutters and performance issues. The game didn’t drop below playable rates until the G15 was down to 10 percent with six minutes remaining. The 200-watt charger also juices the G15 decently fast — during very light Chrome use, it got the device up to 60 percent in 37 minutes. If you don’t want to carry that heavy brick around and aren’t doing GPU-intensive tasks, the G15 also supports 100W Type-C charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLgjcY_2KMF_8qLRHbCwZhJO2ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341901/akrales_210226_4440_0177.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;G15s are available in eclipse gray (like this model) and moonlight white.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="biSl7n"&gt;At the end of the day, there are things I can nitpick about this device. In particular, the lack of a webcam is egregious. And there are reasons it won’t be for everyone. Folks who are looking for a higher refresh-rate screen may prefer to spend more on a Blade 15 Advanced or a GS66. Those who want a jazzier design may find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt; a better fit. And while $1,799 is a great value for these specs, anyone on a tighter budget has options like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo’s Legion 5&lt;/a&gt; on the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wnw6fA"&gt;But almost everything about this laptop is fantastic. And not only is it fantastic, but it’s fantastic for several hundreds of dollars less than its QHD competitors. If you are willing to use an external webcam and you don’t need a 240Hz screen, there’s really no reason you should be buying any other QHD laptop in the thin 15-inch class. The G15 is superior on battery life, superior on power, superior on weight, and superior on price. It’s just the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="lNPn4Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382676"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ajJQjg"&gt;The Xbox Series X and Series S are some of the hottest and most challenging gadgets to buy right now. Fortunately, the Microsoft Store has restocked both the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F8wj714n3rbtl%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-USOUgSpZ9qCTjz66YpabUw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0km1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F942J774TP9JN%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-DwENKSyzuW9qbH9.LbNwQQ%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-DwENKSyzuW9qbH9.LbNwQQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0ku1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-DwENKSyzuW9qbH9.LbNwQQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xpri0ku1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; gaming consoles.

&lt;div id="JWuNH4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hEaps5"&gt;Whether you purchase the most affordable next-gen console (the Xbox Series S) or Microsoft’s most powerful gaming console to date (Series X), both share many accessories that are great for early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93li6a"&gt;Several of the most popular games to play on these consoles include third-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Valhalla-PlayStation-Standard-upgrade-4/dp/B087XR2X4N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some popular Xbox One titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fori-the-collection%2F9p5mbbff3rnt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ori: The Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have all received graphical updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="w7cLmq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10248487"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5tKiL6"&gt;Games aside, there are also a few accessories to consider — most notably, an extra game controller for your new console. You can expand your store, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external SSD&lt;/a&gt; you can purchase, but it is not cheap. Additionally, if you are not interested in buying some games now but need something to play, I suggest getting a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zTzG8L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iKzCOW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="lp0NTe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund has a new leader</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Week NYC Opening Ceremony" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERoZI9dRb6kMMyeJDtoOdnfg02A=/0x815:2055x2185/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68937342/104309684.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Steer speaks at the opening ceremony for New York City’s Climate Week in 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="neCEcv"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund has a new leader and a newly announced deadline. Andrew Steer will take the helm as president and CEO of the Earth Fund in mid-April after stepping down from his role leading one of the environmental organizations Bezos currently funds. According to Steer, Bezos intends to spend the entire $10 billion fund by 2030 — a date that hadn’t previously been publicly disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BnCKj"&gt;Choosing Steer to lead the Earth Fund is another signal that Bezos intends to spend his cash on mainstream strategies to address the climate crisis. Bezos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;first group of grantees&lt;/a&gt; were mostly legacy environmental organizations that work toward the reduction of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, other high-profile efforts have funneled money into hastening the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;development of future technologies&lt;/a&gt; designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22245100/elon-musk-100-million-carbon-capture-removal-x-prize-competition"&gt;capture emissions&lt;/a&gt; after they’ve already been released. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Q6Qfd"&gt;Steer was the president of the World Resources Institute (WRI) for eight years, an organization that received one of the biggest grants from Bezos last November — $100 million. The nonprofit research institute said it would spend the money on &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/news/2020/11/release-gift-bezos-earth-fund-will-support-two-major-climate-initiatives-wri"&gt;two initiatives&lt;/a&gt; over five years. One project is a satellite monitoring system to track carbon dioxide emissions. WRI will also put the money toward electrifying more than 450,000 school buses in the US by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYOtwQ"&gt;Steer vaguely outlined some of the Earth Fund’s priorities on Twitter. “The Earth Fund will invest in scientists, NGOs, activists, and the private sector to help drive new technologies, investments, policy change and behavior,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewSteerWRI/status/1369317237807546372"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “We will emphasize social justice, as climate change disproportionately hurts poor and marginalized communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ADeGfH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Steer vaguely outlined some of the Earth Fund’s priorities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qyPasK"&gt;The Earth Fund has faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some grassroots groups that say Bezos’ initial choice of grantees lacked diversity and didn’t do enough to curb emissions from Bezos’ company Amazon. Many mainstream environmental groups, including those Bezos chose to fund, are &lt;a href="https://diversegreen.org/"&gt;facing a reckoning&lt;/a&gt; over a lack of people of color among their ranks. The Climate Justice Alliance, whose members include environmental organizations led by people of color from communities that have faced a long legacy of pollution, has &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;called on Bezos&lt;/a&gt; and his grantees to redirect money from the fund to their communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBjAqH"&gt;Bezos announced in February that he plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;step down&lt;/a&gt; from his role as CEO of Amazon this year. The move will give him more time for his “&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=0&amp;amp;imprToken=dcbc0c33-6d0e-6d39-48e&amp;amp;tag=curbedcom06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=w50"&gt;passions&lt;/a&gt;,” including the Earth Fund, he wrote at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this stunning FPV drone short film inside a bustling bowling alley</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q42_K0HFUttn0bZiZZCx4hGyRM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936907/GIF_Bowling.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sW1NO"&gt;It’s been a while since most of us have been able to go to a bowling alley, but “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS54fqKxf0"&gt;Right Up Our Alley&lt;/a&gt;” is a new drone video that might just be the next best thing, thanks to an astonishing display of camera work and drone piloting skill, &lt;a href="https://kottke.org/21/03/a-drones-eye-view-of-a-bowling-alley"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kottke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJoVQW"&gt;The video, from YouTuber jaybyrdfilms, doesn’t provide too many details, other than it was shot at &lt;a href="https://www.bryantlakebowl.com/"&gt;Bryant Lake Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis, and it was filmed with an FPV drone. But the footage speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQRqGC"&gt;At first, it gives off the impression of a standard drone flight, with a bird’s-eye view of the building itself. But things quickly shift as the pilot meticulously swoops the drone &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the open door of the bowling alley, maneuvering past diners and waiting bowlers before swooping down the alley itself alongside a spinning bowling ball. Throughout the short clip, the pilot manages to fly the drone back behind the pin setting machines, down a narrow corridor of tools and parts, behind the bar, and even into the pins for a perfect strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LMFWf"&gt;Selling the short film is perfectly dubbed dialogue from bowlers, customers, and the ambient noise from the alley itself, which gives the illusion of actually soaring around the alley as snippets of conversation float by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKB9Ge"&gt;Aspiring pilots might want to just enjoy this one from a distance. Unless you’re an expert drone pilot yourself, though, you might not want to risk a new $1,299 DJI FPV drone to re-create the film in your own local bowling alley. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus surpasses 100 million subscribers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flT-MzE9aU7iWNz0qfxP0L-Ud3Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936883/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIoj03"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/OJDgN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; has officially surpassed 100 million subscribers, less than a year and a half after the streaming service launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcJgO2"&gt;Executives announced the milestone during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/disney"&gt;Disney’s&lt;/a&gt; annual shareholders meeting. The last time Disney gave an update on Disney Plus’ subscribers number was in February during its first quarter earnings; there, it announced that, as of January 2nd, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;there were just over 94 million&lt;/a&gt;. Although executives didn’t say what pushed Disney Plus over 100 million subscribers, the recent success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303068/wandavision-episode-8-explainer-recap-scarlet-witch-white-vision-post-credits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;likely helped. The next big series for Disney Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;out on March 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM1yMq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;The enormous success of Disney Plus ... has inspired us to be even more ambitious, and to significantly increase our investment in the development of high-quality content,” CEO Bob Chapek said in a press release. “In fact, we set a target of [more than] 100 new titles per year, and this includes Disney Animation, Disney Live Action, Marvel, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars,&lt;/em&gt; and National Geographic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="00mtKI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrAUFg"&gt;Disney’s streaming success has caught the attention of everyone in the industry. Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-praises-disney-plus-execution.html"&gt;didn’t think it was possible&lt;/a&gt; that Disney could generate 60 million subscribers for Disney Plus within its first year, and now it has passed 100 million subscribers within 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0OaIZ"&gt;Disney executives originally predicted that Disney Plus would amass between 60 and 90 million subscribers by 2024. The company has blown past that goal and is now targeting between 300 and 350 million subscribers across &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-surpasses-137-million-paid-subscriptions-across-its-direct-to-consumer-services-shattering-previous-guidance-increases-paid-subscriptions-target-to-300-350-million-by/"&gt;all of its streaming platforms&lt;/a&gt; (Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus, Star Plus, HotStar) by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sju4z"&gt;To try to continue growing Disney Plus’ subscriber base, Chapek reiterated that Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.” There are currently several series from every major franchise and brand in development, and it seems likely more mid-tier films (movies that aren’t on the same level as &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, or &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;) will migrate to Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HsNhQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no question that Disney has pulled off an incredible feat with Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8t5dvp"&gt;While 100 million subscribers is an accomplishment, analysts will likely have questions about the revenue breakdown. In December, Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, announced that 30 percent of Disney Plus’ subscriber base comes from Disney Plus HotStar, where the average revenue per customer is lower. As Netflix’s vice president of investor relations, Spencer Wang, pointed out in January, the overall revenue is lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvNuf3"&gt;Still, there’s no question that Disney has pulled off an incredible feat with Disney Plus. Other competitors, like WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal, are trying to scale their own streaming services (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) but are growing at a much slower pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV6ewx"&gt;During the meeting, Disney executive chairman Bob Iger reiterated that he was going to leave the company at the end of the year. This mark’s his final shareholder meeting. Considering he saw the conception and launch of Disney Plus, what an incredible feat to go out on. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yakuza’s lead writer on how Like a Dragon reinvents the series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZQeFdP2F1eFpUP71DODGbOGuUs=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936708/ss_08_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A long, spoiler-filled chat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2LMMT4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is a bold shift for Sega’s long-running series, doing away with beloved protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and shifting to turn-based RPG-style combat. In Kiryu’s place is the wild-haired Ichiban Kasuga, who finds himself homeless in Yokohama after doing 18 years’ hard time for a murder he didn’t commit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukVo4U"&gt;The PlayStation 5 version of &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; was just released last week, a few months after the PS4, Xbox One, PC, and next-gen Xbox versions. Since then, I’ve played several dozens of hours of &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox Series X, and it’s become one of my favorite games in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEdhGs"&gt;I took the opportunity to ask Masayoshi Yokoyama, Sega’s chief producer and writer on the game, some questions about how the team approached Kasuga as a character and his story from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nbkxN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning — there are some pretty heavy &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spoilers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; toward the end of this interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMeYD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, I’d like to ask about Kasuga himself. How involved were you with the character creation process? What were the principles for the character you kept in mind when writing for him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKmYA3"&gt;Basically, I have been in charge of the character settings (such as personalities, speech mannerisms, and the backbone of their action principles) for the main characters that appear in the main story since the first game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0fDt4"&gt;The character, Ichiban Kasuga, was originally born during the development of &lt;em&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku Online&lt;/em&gt;, which is a mobile app title being serviced in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQMYTI"&gt;At the time, we just finished the development of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt; and were ideating on a new protagonist to take Kiryu’s place. That’s when we decided on taking apart the indestructible hero image and creating a more “real-world hero.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="61FM3c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a fresh next-gen start for the series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJrvLL"&gt;Kazuma Kiryu’s personality is representative of characters that appear in “Ninkyo” films, which is a genre of Japanese mafia films that have been around from back in the day. He is generally reserved, stoic, and self-sacrificing, but stronger than anybody and prefers to act alone. In a way, his character embodies qualities that Japanese boys and men would look up to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFWbdw"&gt;Kasuga, on the other hand, was created with the intention of being more “relatable” rather than “admired.” I wanted to create a character whose words and actions would emotionally move us, and someone that you’d want to cheer for and fight alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6gCBY"&gt;Since the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku Online&lt;/em&gt; was a card battle game in which players form decks with their friends to fight against enemies, I wanted to depict the strength of a “leader” rather than the strength of an “individual,” which became the origin of my idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rNkfz"&gt;After that, I compiled all of Ichiban Kasuga’s origin and life story into a document and presented to executive director [Toshihiro] Nagoshi and my team members. This led to talks of potentially using this character for the next console game and then eventually became official for &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NWWVd8tmsz0POlfU7CukUqM8T8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356288/Yokoyama_san_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masayoshi Yokoyama of Sega’s Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KDiJ4Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there a conscious effort to make him different to Kiryu? What do you think the two characters have in common?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJkS0V"&gt;For those that have played both &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, you may have noticed that Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga lead a similar path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZXwGK"&gt;Both had a difficult childhood without the love of their immediate family, then felt extreme gratitude and admiration for the ones that took care of them. Unable to suppress these emotions, both set out on the path of yakuza. Right when they’re about to become full-fledged yakuza, they both go to prison for a crime neither committed. What awaited them after their long sentence was an unimaginably cruel reality… This general flow is exactly the same for both of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAe1E2"&gt;However, just because the two characters’ personalities differ so much, the same general plotline gives off a totally different feel for both. Upon release from prison, Kiryu goes straight to find his mentor Kazama. While Kasuga also tries to find his mentor, Arakawa, before he sets out to do so, he decides to clean himself a bit first and stops by the hair salon to get a botched perm. Both characters follow the same path, but vastly differ in their portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1FVW0"&gt;I actually haven’t had too much difficulty depicting each of the characters. For &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, I set out to write the story after fleshing out Ichiban Kasuga as a human being, so while writing, I even surprised myself at times how different these characters acted within very similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3I73Zg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which came first: the idea to make Kasuga an RPG obsessive, or the decision to shift &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to RPG-style turn-based combat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac5e8D"&gt;The decision to shift to RPG came first. The character setting that Kasuga loves RPGs came after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9GGAe"&gt;As previously mentioned above, the concept was “to create a new relatable hero,” so we chose the most optimal game system (a party system) that would make Ichiban Kasuga’s story interesting. We wouldn’t have made the same decision for Kiryu, who fights with only his own power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOfM7l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Where to start with the Yakuza series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22255880/yakuza-series-xbox-game-pass-where-to-start"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahJopZ"&gt;One of my beliefs in creating games is to “value the core of play.” This involves deciding what the game is supposed to entertain, and then assigning the various components to the right places accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOldbE"&gt;The story is the core element of the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series. This game was made to enjoy the story, and the other elements such as the city used as the setting, music, mini-games, and battle action are all there to elevate the story experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PaXkx"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, the most optimal way for players to experience the story and show the battles of Ichiban Kasuga and his friends that gathered around him was the RPG style. So, upon deciding the RPG genre, there were then a few questions that we had to address, such as: How will we make Kasuga relate to the “hero” job class? What is the logic behind the exchanges during these battles within Kasuga’s mind? One way we addressed these was to make Kasuga an RPG enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/90zkc62TLDzEzhfu5DX5gM-wgUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356330/ss_04_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="waaAEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The character’s personalities are often expressed in their combat moves — was there discussion between the writing and gameplay teams on specific abilities that would be funny or appropriate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrcXzV"&gt;Here at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, there isn’t much of a clear distinction between the writing and game design teams. I started out in what we call in Japan as a “planning position” (game designer), and I’m now kind of like the boss of the whole planning team [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]. All the other writers on the team are selected from among the current planning staff based on their writing skills and put on different projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rCYD0"&gt;Basically, the game designing and narrative writing are not compartmentalized, so our planning crew meetings always have the mini-game designers, battle action staff, and writers in attendance. Even the voice recording is supervised by the person in charge of each part of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP3K1l"&gt;That’s the overall gist of things, so even for anything minor, we discuss and make decisions as a whole team. Ideas are always flowing, but since we value the energy and momentum over the precision of an idea, so we do end up axing a lot of them [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoQw0n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know if this is the same for everyone, but &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; took me a lot longer to finish than other games in the series. This is probably because of the slower-paced combat, but did the longer running time affect your approach to story writing and pacing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8A9Pl"&gt;The volume and length of the story is actually not that different from the past games in the series. So, it didn’t affect the story writing and pacing all that much. We look to the general volume of a 10-episode Japanese drama series when creating the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFjygJ"&gt;For this game, I think the reason for the longer playtime was because of the shift to RPG, requiring more time to level up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo6nc2"&gt;The accelerating the battle tempo was something we worked on until the very end of development. We also continued to make adjustments to the time it takes to level up, but the game is designed so it will become difficult to beat the stronger bosses unless you change jobs and collect materials for better weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IL9dv0"&gt;For those players that are playing this game in the same way you played through the past ones, it might feel a bit longer, but we went with this kind of balancing because we wanted players to discover the fun sights of the city while leveling up their party, instead of simply grinding to level up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g04fmh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; series has a really unique blend of serious and light-hearted subject matter. How do you balance those aspects when writing and make sure everything feels appropriate for the series?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjjgbu"&gt;As touched upon earlier, I think the greatest strength of our team is that the narrative, game design, character design, animation, and sound creation staff all have a deep understanding of what the “core” is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="is0hS5"&gt;The reason for this isn’t simply how long we’ve known each other or how well we get along. I think that each and every staff member loves &lt;em&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;) and I think that’s the biggest reason. I personally am in charge of story writing and also am the chief producer and have a hand in ideating and executing on some marketing and PR initiatives, but every decision I make is based on how to reflect the content of the game in any kind of promotion or campaign, and how to make the game itself more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELnG3S"&gt;All staff members that are involved with the game, including those working within the game and outside of the game, such as the sales team, advertising team, and marketing team, are working hard to increase the produce value of the game, so everyone’s accumulated effort is maybe what creates this great balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nbN0K"&gt;In a past game, someone on the advertising team even wrote and implemented an original story scenario for a real company that appeared in Kamurocho that he was the point person for [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;], so as you can kind of see what kind of team Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecbqs5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the first &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; game where you’re accompanied by a party of characters for almost the entire running time, and they all have their own motivations. Was that a challenge compared to previous &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; games, where the focus tends to be on the current protagonist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6chM0"&gt;In the past, when creating games like &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/em&gt;, which depicted the past of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, and other remake titles, I would dig deeper into the characters other than the protagonist, so this wasn’t so much of a challenge for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gNkUOvNnrfrDX_t_JLdfCQqxaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356331/ss_07_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="az507x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think Arakawa is probably the most pivotal character in the game. The intro does a good job of making him a sympathetic character before setting him up as the villain, and then he’s revealed to have been on the Tojo Clan’s side all along, before meeting a tragic end. How early on in the writing process was his role decided, and was he always intended to have an arc that spanned most of the game’s story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tk5T8C"&gt;This was something that was decided at the start of writing the first chapter. When creating the intro scene of the game, my determination was that “I’m going to depict the life of this man, Masumi Arakawa,” so the game started out on that scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx4fNX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Han Joon-gi twist was particularly unexpected for me given how he died in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. What was the thought behind (sort of) bringing him back as Kim Yeonsu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfdV5D"&gt;This was actually something that was decided around the time I started thinking of Ichiban Kasuga’s story. There wasn’t too much deliberation behind this decision, but my personal thought was that if the Jingweon Mafia were to make an appearance, then Han Joon-gi has to be there, too. In addition, I feel like the Jingweon Mafia would do something like that. Sorry for surprising you [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlLFBT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, the biggest reveal of the game is the return of Kiryu, although his role is quite minor. Were you planning from the beginning to include him in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, considering how &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; seemingly drew a line under his storyline? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHManE"&gt;This wasn’t decided in the early stages of planning the story. When the main themes of the game were decided to be about the dualities of the front and back — the hypocrisy and justice, the superficiality and the truth of Japanese society — I thought it was impossible not to have him appear in the episode of the underworld, so we decided that he would make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWnjMx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have the same question for Goro Majima, who seems to appear in every &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; game to varying degrees now. In &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he’s a difficult boss fight but doesn’t otherwise have a big role in the story — how did you approach his inclusion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqiVh2"&gt;The reason why we decided that he’d make an appearance is the same as for Kazuma Kiryu. However, the big difference is that we cut all ties to the past. This game is unwaveringly seen from Ichiban Kasuga’s perspective, so we got rid of any information or connections that Kasuga has no need of knowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmUxm0"&gt;This is the beginning of the tale of Ichiban Kasuga, and not a continuation of the Kazuma Kiryu story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stSJ4z"&gt;We wanted those players that started the series with &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; to have the same amount of knowledge and emotions as Kasuga when interacting with Majima and other characters from the past series, so we didn’t include any unnecessarily deep interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joMqWDqDlV0T2CQRaD9QmANHjs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356332/ss_02_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nAUzRo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sure you can’t say anything specific about potential future games, but I thought it was interesting how &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like A Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; finished on an open-ended note, with Kasuga deciding his friends are what’s most important to him. Is there a direction you’d like to take the character in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR7qMP"&gt;I think that &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is only the first chapter of Ichiba Kasuga’s life. Since he was in prison for 18 years, he has only just begun his life as an adult man. I’m sure there’s probably many trials and tribulations that await him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez246P"&gt;Even Kazuma Kiryu, who was said to be the strongest, had his life turned upside down with his encounter with a little girl. As Kasuga starts out his new life, he will surely encounter challenges that he cannot solve through violence or brute force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9mtaZj"&gt;I develop each game with the intention of creating a life of a single person. I’m not sure if I’ll continue to write Ichiban Kasuga’s life or not, but I can totally imagine him in deep trouble somewhere on the face of this Earth [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google links Android phones to Chromebooks with new Phone Hub feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtVbpSlFwJvTAKl95CB_OlZBbc0=/0x0:1686x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936690/PhoneHub.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Phone Hub feature in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qU9Hs0"&gt;Google is marking 10 years of Chromebooks by unveiling &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/whatsnew/"&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt; for Chrome OS today. The biggest addition is a new Phone Hub feature that connects an Android phone to a Chromebook. It allows Chrome OS users to respond to texts, check a phone’s battery life, enable its Wi-Fi hotspot, and locate a device easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhMf9B"&gt;Phone Hub is packed into a taskbar widget that even expands to show you recent Chrome tabs that you have been browsing on your phone. It looks like it will be a super useful feature for Android and Chromebook owners. Google is also enabling its Wi-Fi Sync feature on more devices, allowing you to connect to Wi-Fi networks you’ve already configured and used on your Android phone and other Chrome OS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wyd9637fcuhcT5cUNdmwx0GgdRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357091/Nearby_Share.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS gets an AirDrop competitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7gXiT"&gt;Another significant addition to Chrome OS is Nearby Share between Chromebooks and other Android and Chrome OS devices. Much like AirDrop, Nearby Share will let people send and receive files between devices. Google says this will arrive in Chrome OS in the coming months, finally providing its laptop OS with a full AirDrop competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESABWk"&gt;Elsewhere, Google is also adding in a new Screen Capture tool into the Quick Settings menu in Chrome OS. Like the name implies, this will let you record your screen or take screenshots and access them quickly in a “Tote” space from the Chrome OS Shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Screen Capture in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bKkI6zBujcHNbONNUEOV-NPhuc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357087/New_updates_for_Desks.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbgfBY"&gt;The Clipboard is also being improved in Chrome OS, allowing you to save five recent items to paste elsewhere without switching windows. The Launcher Key will provide access to this updated clipboard experience. Quick Answers is another new addition, which lets you right-click a word in Chrome OS to get a definition, translation, or unit conversion. It’s very similar to what exists in macOS today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SosV2E"&gt;Google is even improving the virtual desktops feature of Chrome OS — Desks. When you reboot a Chromebook, it will now restore all windows to their correct virtual desktops, and you can also right-click at the top of an open window to send apps to a different virtual desktops.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS’s clipboard feature is getting a history feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5vgH4n"&gt;Most of these new Chrome OS additions are clearly playing catch-up to what already exists on Windows and macOS, but they’re welcome additions for those relying on Chrome OS every day. Google first launched a range of Chromebooks back in 2011 in a partnership with Samsung and Acer. There are now Chromebooks from every major PC maker, and Google is promising that 50 new Chromebooks will launch during 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2UWlw"&gt;Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1369326373035245581"&gt;now plans to convert the proceeds&lt;/a&gt; from the NFT auction of his first tweet to bitcoin and donate them to charity. The highest bid for the tweet is currently $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q12Fl5"&gt;The auction will end on March 21st, and he plans to donate the bitcoin to &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/"&gt;Give Directly&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that lets donors send money directly to people living in poverty. He’ll be giving the bitcoin to &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/africa/"&gt;Give Directly’s Africa Response fund for COVID-19 relief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLJwGI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ending this March 21st&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will immediately convert proceeds to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And send to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GiveDirectly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; Africa Response&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1369326373035245581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vPKJb"&gt;Dorsey put up his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20"&gt;famous first tweet&lt;/a&gt; as an NFT (which stands for “non-fungible token”) on Friday evening, and bids quickly poured in, even though Dorsey hadn’t announced when the auction would end or that proceeds would be going to charity. The current highest bid was made Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="S6izmA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIW5lq"&gt;The winner will get a “digital certificate of the tweet,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBx-HXY8ow_7bElsJZ6Sk3r2V9cQjSRdWFyKCUXZtAs/edit"&gt;according to an FAQ on NFT auction site Valuables&lt;/a&gt;, where Dorsey’s tweet is for sale. However, the tweet will remain viewable on the internet for free, assuming that Twitter or Dorsey himself won’t remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
