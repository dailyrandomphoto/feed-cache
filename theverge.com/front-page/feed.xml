    <title>Microsoft fixes Windows 11 AMD CPU performance issues with new update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTBFbgNKMLy32uOMd4YmxPQVl5U=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028206/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWvRsv"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a new Windows 11 update today that fixes some of the AMD CPU performance issues. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713310/windows-11-amd-ryzen-processors-performance-issues-software-update-october"&gt;AMD and Microsoft found two issues&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 on Ryzen processors at launch, with one causing L3 cache latency to triple and slowing performance by up to 15 percent in certain games. Microsoft is now &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;fixing this particular issue with Windows 11 Build 22000.282&lt;/a&gt;, available to all Windows 11 users today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaefpY"&gt;While the last Windows 11 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723998/windows-11-update-amd-ryzen-cpu-performance-worse"&gt;made these issues worse&lt;/a&gt;, today’s patch should fix them for good on the L3 cache latency side. The second outstanding issue affects AMD’s preferred core technology, which shifts threads over to the fastest core on a processor. AMD says this second bug could impact performance on CPU-reliant tasks, and we’re expecting the company to fix it with a driver that should be released later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvkCEW"&gt;This new Windows 11 update also includes a large amount of fixes, including one to solve an issue that prevents the Start menu from opening after your OS upgrade, and fixes to input delays for certain Bluetooth mice and keyboards. You can find the full list of fixes that are part of this patch over at &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;Microsof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley creator reveals next game, Haunted Chocolatier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJj8l8_d8GgPKr1V0-yvZ3bxazE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028065/02_3f2jo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N7GyoS"&gt;Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone — better known as ConcernedApe — has announced his second game: &lt;a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ConcernedApe’s Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looks to expand on the &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; formula with a more fantastical setting and “magical haunted ghost chocolate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2mQV4"&gt;“In this game, you will play as a chocolatier living in a haunted castle. In order to thrive in your new role, you will have to gather rare ingredients, make delicious chocolates, and sell them in a chocolate shop,” the game’s website explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJQ7sk"&gt;The new title looks similar to &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; in many respects, with Barone’s meticulous pixel art and animations (at least at this stage of development) appearing virtually identical to his previous title. Barone isn’t saying whether the new title is intended as a sequel to Stardew Valley or if it’s set in the same world at this point, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CtPagVvnsmLAABqDX_KR8zjwtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945691/27_246Fsdfh.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9BNuvl"&gt;In an FAQ on the games website, Barone explains how &lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt; is both similar to and different from his previous game, describing the new title as “more of an action-RPG.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="skUuS8"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt; is another “town game”, where you move to a new town and try your hand at a new way of living. You’ll get to know the townspeople, achieve your goals and make progress in many ways. All of that is similar to Stardew Valley. However, the core gameplay and theming are quite a bit different. Haunted Chocolatier is more of an action-RPG compared to Stardew Valley. And instead of a farm being the focal point of your endeavors, it’s a chocolate shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PDG4lN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier &lt;/em&gt;has been in development for about a year, and Barone isn’t willing to commit to a release date or even a release window yet. He does note that the title is currently single-player, with no plans for multiplayer, and that the only platform he’s “100 percent certain about” is PC, although he has “every intention of bringing it to the other major platforms as well.” Additionally, like the initial development of &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;, Barone is making &lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt; single-handedly, with plans to self-publish the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2FuuS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla offers a glimpse of a future without Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla boss visits factory construction site in Grünheide" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKuE7XN2MzTZ4FAkOY8Ob_tGMTs=/0x0:5320x3547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028035/1232949449.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxQUAN"&gt;Elon Musk may seem inseparable from Tesla, but on Wednesday night, the company offered the first real taste of what it might look like without its billionaire CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvcZSO"&gt;Tesla held a regularly scheduled conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results, but — as he’d &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/musk-says-he-may-skip-future-tesla-earnings-calls?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously teased&lt;/a&gt; — Musk did not attend. His absence took what’s normally a venue for his rants and ramblings, dismissals of Wall Street, and attacks on the press and turned it into a coherent (if scripted) presentation of the company’s recent progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGZfZg"&gt;There were fewer sideshows and a more measured tone, though the executives who spoke in Musk’s place still made some contradictions. If Musk were to leave his post atop the company, it’s likely that Tesla would look and sound a lot like how the company was presented on Wednesday night’s call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XI79oJ"&gt;Musk has talked about stepping down from Tesla for a few years, especially after the Model 3 and Model Y helped the company find some financial stability. Perhaps most notably, in July, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/elon-musk-tells-court-tesla-s-solarcity-deal-wasn-t-a-bailout?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;testified in court&lt;/a&gt; that he had “tried hard not to be the CEO at Tesla, but I had to or it would die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8HtAPL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk once said he “tried hard not to be the CEO at Tesla”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeFTD"&gt;He wasn’t kidding — he once said that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/25/elon-musk-tesla-had-single-digit-weeks-before-it-would-die.html"&gt;company was “single-digit weeks” away from collapse&lt;/a&gt; during the first big push to mass-produce the Model 3. It was around that time in 2018 that he got himself (and Tesla) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The company also started facing some of the most intense waves of scrutiny about its Autopilot software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR0Wls"&gt;Facing all that pressure, an admittedly &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleep-deprivation-damage-2018-8"&gt;sleep-deprived&lt;/a&gt; Musk often used the quarterly earnings call to blow off steam. In late 2017, he yelled “shame” at journalists and their editors for &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-just-yelled-shame-at-a-bunch-of-journalists-1820059349"&gt;writing about the company’s layoffs&lt;/a&gt;. In early 2018, he cut off Wall Street analysts &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/03/608103257/elon-musk-to-analysts-stop-with-the-boring-bonehead-questions-on-tesla"&gt;for asking “boring, bonehead” questions&lt;/a&gt; and started the practice of fielding inquiries from retail shareholders. Three months after that, he &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/highlights-from-elon-musk-on-teslas-earnings-call.html"&gt;apologized to those same analysts&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2020, he said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242102/elon-musk-coronavirus-fascist-shelter-in-place-tesla-covid-19-safety-science"&gt;the shelter-in-place orders meant to stop the spread of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; were “fascist.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHJidv"&gt;There was none of that Wednesday night. Taking Musk’s place was Tesla’s chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn, along with vice presidents Lars Moravy and Drew Baglino. The trio bounded through pre-submitted questions from shareholders as well as live ones from the bankers. When asked about the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;investigations into Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, they gave diplomatic answers about how they “embrace the scrutiny of [Tesla’s] products,” and preached cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtkqSR"&gt;They still massaged some things, though. Tesla is not just cooperating with NHTSA, it’s “partnering” with the safety agency on the “journey to the transition to a software-oriented vehicle,” Kirkhorn said. Tesla is being “extremely transparent” about the ongoing test of the Full Self-Driving beta software, they claimed, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699361/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-nda-footage"&gt;making owners sign nondisclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt; until very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVcypT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fewer diversions, but Musk’s big goals are still front and center&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jqbTeB"&gt;The vibe certainly changed, but Kirkhorn and crew still obsessed over growth, much like Musk. Kirkhorn recommitted to the company’s goal of increasing the number of vehicles it builds each year by 50 percent. The Model Y is “poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world,” Moravy said. Musk has imbued Tesla with a ton of momentum, and the executives who’ve remained with him clearly won’t slow that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr6YQU"&gt;If — or when — Musk steps down as Tesla’s CEO, the company will likely resemble the one on Wednesday’s call. What’s unknowable is how Tesla would respond to Musk’s use of Twitter if he occupies a different perch. Right now, when he tweets about making changes to Tesla’s products, the people who work at the company have a pretty explicit obligation to make those changes happen. If he’s in a reduced role, or removed from the company entirely (perhaps to focus more on SpaceX’s growing operations in Texas), will Tesla’s executives give those tweets the same kind of weight? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAUxdL"&gt;Perhaps when Musk isn’t CEO, his public proclamations will have less of an effect on the company’s sky-high stock price. Musk even said at one point that he believed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;share price was too high&lt;/a&gt; — though that was billions of dollars worth of valuation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364073/tesla-five-way-stock-split-august-21-plan-approved-shares-accessible-cheaper"&gt;and a stock split ago&lt;/a&gt;, so the market has proven its willingness to ignore him before. (For what it’s worth, Tesla’s stock price closed higher than ever on Thursday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJsDO2"&gt;Tesla has now turned a profit in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;nine straight quarters&lt;/a&gt;, and 11 of the last 13. It’s still got its fair share of challenges ahead as it continues to build up factories in new places around the globe. But the company appears to be in the kind of shape Musk has said is required before he’d consider leaving. Maybe we’ll get a chance to evaluate his influence on Tesla from something other than the CEO role sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCip58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVNlM3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is white-labeling Google Stadia to give you free Batman game streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Batman Arkham Knight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SiLmkRgx4hYWZlBxSCG8_rfA-5g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027946/533ca3dcc5607.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dhvWOn"&gt;Months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;we predicted that Stadia would soon become a white-label cloud-gaming service&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T appears to be taking Google up on the idea. AT&amp;amp;T is offering a free browser-based version of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt; exclusively for wireless customers that makes use of Stadia’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxzk2P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirmed that its new game streaming experience runs on Google Stadia’s tech (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/21/att-confirms-stadia-arkham-knight-teases-cloud-gaming-ambitions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Google announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;the shutdown of its internal Stadia game studio&lt;/a&gt; in February. While Stadia is still available and supported by Google, the studio shutdown means Google is relying on third parties to provide all the games, and it opens up the potential for Google’s partners to use the tech.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Arkham Knight demo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCBJ3yKyUQMVFgIpO9PSUrP-fDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945285/batman_arkham_knight_att.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WssIXv"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is apparently the first of those partners — it released &lt;a href="https://more.att.com/play/batman/"&gt;a browser-based demo of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is being powered by the Stadia technology,” an AT&amp;amp;T representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “For this demo AT&amp;amp;T created a front end experience to enable gamers to play &lt;em&gt;Batman Arkham Knight &lt;/em&gt;directly from their own website and the game is playable on virtually any computer or laptop.” Although AT&amp;amp;T calls it a “demo,” there’s no mention of length, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXnYZsmf-Ao"&gt;as shown in a short walkthrough of the experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AUFYd"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also adds that you can stream &lt;em&gt;Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt; at up to 1080p and 60fps, which is the same performance you’ll get if you use Stadia for free. Paid Stadia Pro subscribers have the ability to stream up to 4K at 60fps, for which AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t offer an option. On the &lt;em&gt;Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;page, AT&amp;amp;T notes that the game will be “available for a limited time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWT634"&gt;We also asked AT&amp;amp;T whether the company would be working on similar Stadia-powered games in the future or if it planned on establishing a game streaming service for customers. AT&amp;amp;T wasn’t able to share any additional details, but its dip into Stadia technology may open the door for other companies to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOpuzK"&gt;Will other companies &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to partner with Stadia? Stadia’s servers may be in need of a hardware upgrade soon, and there’s no word on when that will happen. Currently, &lt;a href="https://stadia.dev/about/"&gt;the hardware in Stadia’s servers is still the same&lt;/a&gt; as when the service first launched in 2019, consisting of a custom 2.7GHz x86 processor, a custom AMD GPU offering up to 10.7 teraflops of processing power, and 16GB of RAM. In theory, this should promise powerful performance, however, that didn’t really pan out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;our Stadia review&lt;/a&gt; — we discovered that 4K looked closer to 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tCt3I"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;Nvidia just announced that it plans on equipping its GeForce Now servers with hardware equivalent to the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546139/xbox-xcloud-series-x-hardware-games-servers-datacenters"&gt;Microsoft even upgraded its xCloud servers&lt;/a&gt; with Xbox Series X hardware in June. Stadia will need a plan to upgrade its own hardware if it wants to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Xbox Series X’s dashboard can now display in native 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XH9qRaxCXKBNaSMUKqv3WnDrfXc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027908/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sM2pjX"&gt;Microsoft’s October update for the Xbox Series X includes the long-awaited jump to a native 4K resolution dashboard. Previously, the system software upscaled 1080p to 4K, by which enthusiasts, including several people who work for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, were not totally satisfied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RssDl"&gt;The improved picture quality extends across the home dashboard on the Series X (but not the Series S), as well as the My Games &amp;amp; Apps screen, the Xbox Guide, and “many other experiences.” Microsoft says that game art and button prompts will have “increased sharpness and improved text readability.” Microsoft provided an image for comparison, shown below, and the difference is clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5NZb8"&gt;Now, you can endlessly stare at the TV in true 4K wondering what to play or watch while time slips you by.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Xbox Series X interface" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuMmS7VB2CQVCYzQvbN0ZVBzBTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945559/4K_SD_Comparison.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new 4K dashboard on Series X will bring a more crisp interface, among other elements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBBcV2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/october-2021-xbox-update/"&gt;The October update&lt;/a&gt; is adding some other quality-of-life features to both the Series X and Series S, including a new night mode that lets you adjust the hue of your display to your liking, perhaps to make it easier on the eyes when the lights get low, or if you have a sensitivity to bright screens. Microsoft says that its night mode settings work across the Xbox on a system level, including on apps and games, but it does not impact performance, nor will your preferences affect how your screenshots or game clips look. Also, you can set a schedule for when you’d like the feature to turn on and off, or set it to the sunrise and sunset cadence.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can adjust the brightness, as well as the amount of blue light on display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fTrGqE"&gt;Relatedly, there are new accessibility features that let you customize the brightness of the light in the middle of your Xbox wireless controller, as well as the light that illuminates on your console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ES2NTC"&gt;Lastly, Microsoft is adding the Quick Settings menu to the Xbox Guide window that appears when you press the Xbox button on your controller. The company says it will allow you to “quickly toggle accessibility features without leaving your game or app.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap blames revenue hit on iOS ad tracking changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Snapchat white ghost logo on a bright yellow background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLJK0wXTHWkMqvXpL9G3BZe61ok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027882/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RqFMsM"&gt;Snap has some things to be happy about this quarter. It crossed $1 billion in revenue for the first time, added 13 million daily users, and doubled submissions to Spotlight, its relatively new TikTok rival. But it has also ran into a serious and ballooning problem: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple’s ad tracking changes&lt;/a&gt;, which have already led to millions in lost ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMLYCi"&gt;The company missed its revenue target by $3 million in the third quarter, largely because of Apple’s changes, Snap announced this afternoon. That’s not a huge miss on its own, but Snap expects the impact to continue next quarter and says its revenue growth will slow meaningfully as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EtiR7X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A more significant impact on our business than we had expected”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hi4dkC"&gt;“We grappled with industry changes to the way advertising is targeted, optimized, and measured on iOS that created a more significant impact on our business than we had expected,” Jeremi Gorman, Snap’s chief business officer, said in prepared remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNtgeP"&gt;In April, Apple released an update to iOS that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;required all users to proactively opt in&lt;/a&gt; to ad tracking across apps and websites — which, no surprise, a lot of people didn’t want to do. That’s made it harder for apps and advertisers to tell when their ads are working, from exactly how they’re being seen to whether they’re actually resulting in purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSyfTc"&gt;Snap had been hopeful that it wouldn’t be hit by the changes too badly. “I think we prepared it the best that we can,” Gorman said just last quarter. But today’s remarks are filled with references to the changes and their impact. CEO Evan Spiegel said Snap’s ad business was “disrupted” by the changes and that Apple’s alternative ad tools “did not scale as we had expected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMGDVo"&gt;These earnings may be a preview of the week to come. Twitter and Facebook report earnings next week, and they’re likely to get hit by the changes, too. In Facebook’s case, the impact will likely be much worse given its historical reliance on the kind of tracking that Apple’s prompt cuts off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdrm6W"&gt;Snap, for its part, is trying to move past the iOS changes by developing its own alternative tools for advertisers. But its own tool, called Advanced Conversations, “will take time to be fully adopted,” the company warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fBK8W5"&gt;Across the board, ad-driven companies will have to figure out a solution to what’s proving to be a seismic shift: the old way of measuring ads is no longer effective on one of the biggest platforms in the world. They’ll either have to figure out new ways of making money or new ways of proving that their ads actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aplnij"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max and HBO’s US subscriptions dip following Amazon exit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IN_w0tz4ylGnpi9b9jJH9C6CZzU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027865/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ngdbyH"&gt;HBO Max is still growing — but the service appears to have felt the impact of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21587715/hbo-max-warnermedia-amazon-prime-video-channels-2021"&gt;exit from Amazon Prime Channels&lt;/a&gt; earlier this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGDTnx"&gt;HBO Max and HBO subscriptions collectively grew to 69.4 million internationally from 67.5 million the previous quarter, the company reported during its second-quarter earnings presentation. But its combined subscriptions to both services dropped in the US from 47 million last quarter to 45.2 million this quarter — a difference of 1.8 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvhCLN"&gt;So while its total subscription numbers were up 1.9 million subscribers for the quarter (and up 12.5 million, year over year) — meaning they’re still ballooning — the combined services still saw a loss in US subscriptions. AT&amp;amp;T said in its &lt;a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR-V2/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2021/q321/ATT_3Q21_Earnings_Release_FINAL.pdf"&gt;earnings report&lt;/a&gt; that “international and ad-supported subscriber gains were partially offset by HBO Max being discontinued on the Amazon wholesale platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="njoBWR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HBO lost 1.8 million subscribers in the US this quarter across standard HBO and HBO Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fxBR21"&gt;A spokesperson for AT&amp;amp;T confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the decision to remove HBO from Amazon Prime Channels did, in fact, hurt its domestic subscriber numbers. But the spokesperson added that the company also expects “to get some of these subscribers back into the retail base in the later part of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqYLag"&gt;HBO Max launched in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/6/29/22556006/hbo-max-launches-in-39-international-markets-outside-us"&gt;39 territories&lt;/a&gt; outside of the US toward the end of June. Meanwhile, the streamer’s cheaper, ad-supported tier that costs $10 a month — a discount of $5 off its premium subscription — launched earlier in June. Andy Forssell, EVP and general manager of WarnerMedia direct-to-consumer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465317/hbo-max-ad-supported-plan"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; the company expected the discounted plan would help HBO Max “reach a wider audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYGFBu"&gt;While it's difficult to pin down just how much the Amazon Prime Channels exit alone impacted subscribers, the company stood to lose &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-22/hbo-is-about-to-lose-5-million-customers-it-s-not-concerned?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;5 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; by bailing from the platform. Even still, Forssell told &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-22/hbo-is-about-to-lose-5-million-customers-it-s-not-concerned?sref=P6Q0mxvj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August that the company didn’t see the move impacting its end-of-year subscriber goals, and he appears to be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svgyPw"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T reported that it still expects to reach the higher end of its subscriber goal of between 70 million and 73 million — which shouldn’t be hard, barring any major controversy or unforeseen failure that leads HBO and HBO Max users to jump from the apps en masse. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 101: how to free up space on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_tKj4Zu4bODR5smc6AEbt_v0Lw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027682/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IzRTjs"&gt;It can happen all too easily, especially if you’ve got an Android phone with less than 128GB of storage: one day, you try to install a cool new game or an intriguing new app, and you can’t. You’ve run out of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoqml5"&gt;Don’t panic. If you’re not ready to buy a new phone, and your phone doesn’t have a handy microSD slot for some extra storage, you can probably still pick up a decent amount of free space with some simple house cleaning. Here are some suggestions on how to get back some of that storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiWtyM"&gt;Note: These were tested using a Pixel 3 phone running Android 12. Depending on your phone’s make and operating system, your directions may vary slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GnNVLi"&gt;Use Android’s “Free up space” tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xuRMFJ"&gt;Android has a built-in tool to help you increase the amount of useable storage on your phone. It’s easy to find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TKpz8N"&gt;Go to your phone’s settings, and select “Storage.” You’ll see information on how much space is in use and a list of file categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kyOaXr"&gt;Tap on the “Free up space” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DD4kWK"&gt;You’ll be moved to Google’s Files app — specifically, to its “Clean” feature, which offers suggestions on how to free up space by getting rid of junk files, deleted screenshots, large photos, backed-up media, and unused apps; there may be other suggestions as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the “Free up space” button to help clean up your phone’s storage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtE_I-qwQ4dYONX_tSzTN2bQ9ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944616/Screenshot_20211021_101947.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Free up space” button can help clean up your phone’s storage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Files app can offer a number of ways to clear out old files." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCGLmGszvbcKznMaBGpRZ5D21dI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944618/Screenshot_20211021_102518.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Files app can offer a number of ways to clear out old files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCo26D"&gt;There are other handy tools in the “Storage” section. For example, you can find out how much space each of your apps takes up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xxSLLB"&gt;In Storage, tap on Apps. You’ll get a list of all your apps, along with how much space each is taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vMLIW5"&gt;Tap on the app name. You can now see the app size, how much of the available storage is being used by user data, and how much space is being used by the cache. Two buttons let you either “Clear storage” or “Clear cache.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Storage &amp;amp;gt; Apps, you can see how much space apps take up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5vRn88E-Mh0tgJh57uGkq-__kw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944644/Screenshot_20211021_103604.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Storage &amp;gt; Apps, you can see how much space apps take up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to clear your cache to save space." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rURyrDAFS7hX86azSGySFMopMJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944647/Screenshot_20211021_103415__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to clear your cache to save space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuovL5"&gt;(Note for newbies: it is usually safe to clear the cache. However, before you hit “Clear storage,” check to see what your user data is. You don’t want to accidentally delete any important media or documents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HyaVI"&gt;Finally, there is a hidden toggle for a feature called “Smart Storage,” which gives your phone permission to automatically remove backed-up photos after 60 days. It will also automatically remove backed-up photos and videos if the storage on your device has less than 25 percent space left. You turn it on (or off) via Google’s Files app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zTA1bh"&gt;Open the Files app and tap the three parallel lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X5eehG"&gt;Select Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CFCEX5"&gt;Look for the Smart Storage setting and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the Settings for the Files app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCLizfkd2YJew9Jum2uJfYX15Tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944706/Screenshot_20211021_110015.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the Settings for the Files app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle Smart Storage on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Unp5i_gHMXB4-8zdvf9rgl8gLaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944708/Screenshot_20211021_105955.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle Smart Storage on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVu23o"&gt;Check your apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LfqXSH"&gt;A good way to save space is to make sure you’re not clogging up the works with apps that you haven’t used in months. It’s all too easy to download an app, try it out, and then let it sit while you go on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dU6ZS4"&gt;If you’re curious about how long it’s been since you’ve used certain apps, here’s how to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hulp9E"&gt;Tap on your Play Store app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QEVczG"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper right corner and select “Manage apps &amp;amp; device.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PAFbZt"&gt;Select the Manage tab. On the line below that, the Installed button should be highlighted; if it isn’t, tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cDSWR8"&gt;To the right of the Apps heading, you’ll see the sorting icon. Tap on that and select “Least used.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BSQKva"&gt;Now, you can see the apps that you’ve only used occasionally (if at all) on top of the list. You won’t necessarily want to get rid of them — sometimes an app is fine to have around just in case — but you might catch some that you really don’t need anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Files app helps you manage all the apps on your phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avt6qS7iG2hmSSYxa3QIksBQtfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944742/Screenshot_20211021_111012.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Files app helps you manage all the apps on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can sort your apps by the least used." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYuGF4Ymka3C3_OyTyJpETLH3DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944744/Screenshot_20211021_111215.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can sort your apps by the least used.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0HvW"&gt;Store your photos online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XMjVh5"&gt;Photos and videos can be some of the most space-hogging items on your phone. Luckily, if you’ve got an Android phone, you’re probably already uploading your photos to Google Photos — and can therefore take them off your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOb173"&gt;First, check to make sure you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; backing up your photos to your Google account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Uc7FJR"&gt;Open the Photos app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6oS59e"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper right corner. If you’re backing up your photos, you should see a “Backup complete” entry in the drop-down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wt5x8P"&gt;If you’re not backing up your photos, then select “Photos settings” &amp;gt; “Back up &amp;amp; sync.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gUql0a"&gt;Make sure that the “Back up &amp;amp; sync” toggle on top of the page is set to “On.” You should also check which account is listed under “Backup Account.” If you have more than one account, you can switch to whichever you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

&lt;p id="dZTR3V"&gt;There are other options as well. For example, you can choose the quality of the photos you want to upload and whether you want the phone to upload photos when you’re using cellular data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFP21g"&gt;Now that you’re sure your photos are being backed up, you can delete them from your phone. It’s very likely that there is already a notice on top of the Photo app’s front page offering to free up memory from your device; if not, it’s easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ceuxav"&gt;In the “Photo settings” menu, tap on “Free up device storage.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JMW25G"&gt;You’ll get a window saying how much memory and how many items will be removed. Select the “Free up XX” at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="TliatA"&gt;Still running out of space? Then, unfortunately — or luckily, if you’re looking for a good excuse — it may be time to start thinking about a new phone, one with more storage space and perhaps that also offers you the chance to offload your data onto a micro-SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Driverless’ Tesla crash in Texas wasn’t actually driverless, NTSB says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xl3-hCrsb_gAZ1VkSHIL22lLMZ8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027558/EzRSmWwVUAQVVNj__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/MattKHOU/status/1383821809053683721/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Dougherty/KHOU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmluZv"&gt;The driver and passenger seats were both occupied in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;Tesla Model S that crashed into a tree outside of Houston on April 17th&lt;/a&gt;, killing both occupants, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Dk4k3"&gt;The crash made news when local investigators on the scene initially reported that neither body recovered from the Telsa was behind the wheel. Mark Herman, a constable from Harris County Precinct 4, &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;told KHOU&lt;/a&gt; that one of the men killed was in the front passenger seat of the car, while the other was in the back seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy202e"&gt;“They are 100 percent certain that no one was in the driver seat driving that vehicle at the time of impact. They are positive,” Herman told KHOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyldHH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;Federal investigators quickly swooped in&lt;/a&gt; to determine the accuracy of the claim. NTSB, which investigates civilian transportation crashes, sent two officials to Texas to examine the crash, with a particular focus on “the vehicle’s operation and the post-crash fire.” Tesla also sent representatives from the company to inspect the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LNrZi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost immediately, the claim that no one was behind the wheel seemed to fall apart&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGJupe"&gt;Almost immediately, the claim that no one was behind the wheel seemed to fall apart. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicated that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;And the company’s own inspectors determined&lt;/a&gt; that the steering wheel was “deformed,” leading them to conclude there was someone in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCDQ6Q"&gt;Also, security camera footage from the vehicle owner’s home captured him entering the driver’s side door, while his companion got in on the passenger side. And NTSB crash investigators tested whether Tesla’s Autopilot would work on the part of the road, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429198/tesla-ntsb-texas-crash-driverless-preliminary-report"&gt;concluding&lt;/a&gt; that adaptive cruise control could be engaged but not Tesla’s Autosteer feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VI9Gc"&gt;Now, the agency has released a &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/HWY21FH007.aspx"&gt;new preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; further refuting the claim that the driver seat was unoccupied at the time of the crash. According to the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JTwCj4"&gt;With the assistance of the [event data recorder] module manufacturer, the NTSB Recorders Laboratory repaired and downloaded the fire-damaged EDR. Data from the module indicate that both the driver and the passenger seats were occupied, and that the seat belts were buckled when the EDR recorded the crash. The data also indicate that the driver was applying the accelerator in the time leading up to the crash; application of the accelerator pedal was found to be as high as 98.8 percent. The highest speed recorded by the EDR in the 5 seconds leading up to the crash was 67 mph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEluJU"&gt;NTSB said that its investigation was still in the preliminary stage and that “no conclusions about how the crash happened should be drawn from the information in this investigative update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9j0yv"&gt;The fears of a driverless Tesla crash are certainly justified. Tesla owners have shown that Autopilot can be used on roads without lane markings, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; recently conducted a test&lt;/a&gt; proving that Tesla’s vehicles can easily be tricked into thinking there is someone behind the wheel, even when there’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZPIGF"&gt;Tesla finds itself under more scrutiny than ever, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the middle of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;investigation into a dozen incidents&lt;/a&gt; in which Teslas with Autopilot have crashed into emergency vehicles. And two prominent Senate Democrats have urged federal regulators to take “corrective actions” against Tesla to prevent further misuse of the company’s advanced driver assist feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Locke and Key’s second season is darker but loses the magic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejyuc1y4qcVuPx5UqLLyS6V3KQg=/5x0:3596x2394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027482/LOCKE_201_Unit_01644RC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amanda Matlovich / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="slQvXy"&gt;Netflix’s show about teens fighting demons with magical keys is back, but &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt;’s second season makes some big changes. The pace is faster, the tone is darker, and with that, it loses some of the magic that made the show so interesting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TZGj6"&gt;Things don’t start out so dark, though. At the outset of &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt;’s second season, things are going well for the Locke family. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126612/netflix-locke-and-key-new-series-riverdale-haunting-of-hill-house-review"&gt;After dealing with the death of their father and surviving a fight with a demon in season 1&lt;/a&gt;, they’re able to spend the summer relaxing with friends and their keys. It’s one of the rare times in the series we see magic used for having fun; Kinsey (Emilia Jones) is relaxing inside her own head (literally), and younger brother Bodie (Jackson Robert Scott) is using a new super-strength key to rearrange old furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqcvFT"&gt;It’s playful and surreal — but it doesn’t last for long. Eventually, the demon makes its return, and the rest of the season feels like a race as the Locke kids try to defeat it. The new season is certainly darker than its predecessor, and it delves a little more into the history of magic in this world. But it also moves too fast for its own good. Whereas season 1 was about introducing mystery, the sophomore effort is more like a drawn-out superhero battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiAyEd"&gt;For those just catching up, &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt; is a live-action adaptation of a comic series by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez, which follows the Locke family as they move back into their ancestral home, called Keyhouse, in New England. It’s a sprawling mansion with an extremely cool secret: it’s full of hidden magical keys, each with strange powers. One makes it possible to enter someone’s mind as if it were a real, physical place; another lets you open a door to anywhere you can picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlErgM"&gt;The Locke children — which include Kinsey, Bodie, and older brother Tyler (Connor Jessup) — hear these keys whisper to them and steadily accumulate an arsenal of supernatural abilities. The keys themselves are made from a strange metal that comes from a hidden portal (stay with me here), which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be home to demons that can occasionally crossover to our world. The first season mostly involved one such creature, named Dodge, trying to get the keys from the Lockes for all kinds of nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bITITK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6bsSANYz14?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcC9JR"&gt;At the outset of season 2, everyone thinks Dodge has been defeated, but — as the twist at the end of the first season revealed — it’s actually just in a different body, thanks to one of those helpful keys. In the first season, Dodge was primarily depicted as a terrifying woman (Laysla De Oliveira) but also occasionally took on the role of an unassuming high school boy Gabe (Griffin Gluck), who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be Kinsey’s boyfriend. While everyone thinks Dodge is gone, Gabe is hatching a plan to create an army of demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcyDOx"&gt;While the basic premise is the same — i.e., the kids need to defeat Dodge — the two seasons play out very differently. The first felt like a mashup of the teen drama of &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt; and the dark, family mysteries from something like &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;. You slowly learned the secrets of the keys and how they impacted the Lockes and their closest friends. Season 2 gets into that a little bit, particularly with some flashbacks that shed light on the early days of Keyhouse and details on how, exactly, the keys were made. But mostly, it feels like a race: Gabe rushing to create his army and the kids trying to stop him. It’s chaotic. And the fast pace means the show gets away from the best parts of the story, namely all of the deep, dark secrets involving the keys and the portal to the demon world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue0djC"&gt;Even the newly introduced keys seem off. Instead of opening up new possibilities for storytelling — like the key that turns you into a ghost so you can talk to dead relatives — they feel more like superpowers. One gives you super strength; another is essentially a living chain that can be used as a weapon. Quite handy for dealing with demon teens but not as interesting as delving into someone’s subconscious. It also doesn’t help that the new villain is nowhere near as intimidating as the original. De Oliveira’s take on Dodge was ruthless and menacing, an impeccably dressed monster you definitely didn’t want to mess with. But Gabe has a very different vibe: less scary, more a pompous jerk you want to punch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="locke and key" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXAGvhwG3PmEnKQmZwyR2rh9MSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944709/LOCKE_207_Unit_03076RC.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amanda Matlovich / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ezUMe7"&gt;There are some cool ideas here. As the kids get older, they start reckoning with the reality that they’ll forget about magic as soon as they turn 18. And then are some very dark, horror-like moments that are reminiscent of the books; one particularly terrifying scene involves living mannequins inside of a demon’s mind, and there’s at least one shockingly grisly murder. But most of these moments are fleeting or frustratingly underdeveloped, like a story thread involving a history teacher who knows a little too much about the Lockes that never really goes anywhere. For the most part, all of these interesting moments are reduced to clear and obvious steps leading to the final confrontation at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjqQn4"&gt;It’s disappointing to see the show shift away from its most intriguing elements, and unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like things will change. Season 3 of &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt; has already wrapped filming, and based on the way the current season ends, there’s going to be yet another big bad to fight. Hopefully, it brings some secrets along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJYK8O"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Locke and Key &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;season 2 streams on Netflix on October 22nd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
