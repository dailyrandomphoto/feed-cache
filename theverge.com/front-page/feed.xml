    <title>Garmin Vivomove Sport review: the right mix of form and function</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, a Garmin hybrid that checks off all the boxes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6XM6ED"&gt;In theory, hybrid smartwatches should offer the best of analog design and modern technology — something sleek and beautiful on the wrist but capable of discreetly tracking your health and delivering notifications. In practice, companies tend to put a premium on that chic design, leaving you with a smartwatch that’s not as functional as others in its price range. But Garmin’s entry-level Vivomove Sport is affordable at $179.99, with a design and feature set that matches the price. Finally, it feels like we’re getting somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mclypo"&gt;The Vivomove Sport was just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches"&gt;introduced at CES 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s Garmin’s first new hybrid since it launched the Vivomove Luxe, Style, and 3 / 3S back in 2019. At a glance, the Sport looks like a Swatch. (Actually, my mint green review unit looks &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;a href="https://www.swatch.com/en-us/fairy-frosty-ll123/LL123.html"&gt;this particular Swatch&lt;/a&gt;.) However, a flick of the wrist or a double-tap to the display will reveal your stats, notifications, timers, and other widgets for Garmin-specific fitness features. The display reminds me a lot of what AR glasses try to do — project a ghostly, holographic-like information overlay on an otherwise ordinary object. It’s a neat effect, and it’s easier to see your data and notifications compared to the last hybrid I tested, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;Withings ScanWatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCWIH9"&gt;Of course, hybrid displays come with limitations. The Sport is good if you want to stay in the loop without major distractions. You can’t really read full messages in the bottom half of the screen — but you can easily see who or what app is trying to reach you. However, this is the sort of watch that tells you when to look at your phone. It’s not the kind that lets you leave it at home. There are no contactless payments, it opts for tethered GPS, and there’s no speaker or microphone for you to take calls via the wrist. (Android owners can use quick replies to texts and reject phone calls with text.) You can, however, set timers, start breathing sessions, log hydration, and view health metrics like heart rate and stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q74Ybj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10976670"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="weGp1x"&gt;To move between menus, you just swipe left and right. To select, you tap once. To go back to the previous menu, you just tap the tiny arrow that pops up. By default, a long press acts as a shortcut to the workout app for easy recording. Is the navigation a little clunky? Yes. But this is true for every hybrid watch I’ve ever tested. Garmin’s menu navigation is at least better than the one Fossil uses for its e-ink hybrids. The only time it really failed me was when I had sweaty fingers after a workout — but then again, this is why a lot of athletes are pro-physical buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QS5Cr8"&gt;Functionally, you can get pretty close to a hands-off experience. Garmin says it has an estimated five days of battery life — I got closer to 3–4 with frequent GPS activities. That’s good as far as smartwatches go but on the shorter side for a hybrid. That said, you don’t have to sync every day if you don’t want to. It stores up to 10 timed activities and 14 days’ worth of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nG7fvH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Basically this is a no-frills tracker in a smartwatch’s body&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0y1Q24"&gt;Basically, this is a no-frills fitness tracker in a smartwatch’s body. What sets this particular one apart is its design is both cute and functional, and the available options are versatile for multiple aesthetics. As much as I dig the Fitbit Luxe’s bougie divorcee energy, it sometimes looks too much like a tracker for dressier occasions. I’d have to get another strap to fix that. I wouldn’t have to with something like the Sport. It’s also a comfortable tracker. The 40mm case is smaller than the vast majority of wristables on the market, and it doesn’t overpower my tiny bird wrists. It doesn’t get caught on jacket sleeves, I don’t have to worry about the silicone straps getting groady after a workout, and it’s very lightweight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nftwUDOcInF6oGnIY6znOZ3FB74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162060/vsong_220110_4962_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hidden OLED is discreet and good enough to let you know when you should check your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aEV1pi"&gt;But you don’t have to take just my word for it. I have a particularly opinionated friend who loves to rant how all the smartwatches I test are hulking eyesores that are too uncomfortable for her to ever consider buying one. But when she eyed the Sport, she grabbed my arm and said, “Is this smart? &lt;em&gt;Oh,&lt;/em&gt; I’d wear this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4i6Y62"&gt;While the Sport is a design-forward tracker, you’d be wrong to assume it skimps on health features. It has optical heart rate and SpO2 sensors and can provide abnormal heart rate alerts. It’s also capable of measuring your respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and blood oxygen levels — both in the form of continuous measurement during sleep and spot checks. Stress tracking on most devices is also still a work in progress, but Garmin’s is better than most. Body battery is a neat metric that visualizes how much energy you have for activities. The gist is it measures a combination of your sleep quality, exercise, stress, and heart rate variability to determine whether or not you should push it or take it easy. While more wearables offer similar “readiness” metrics these days, they can be hit or miss. Garmin’s version has grown on me over the years as a helpful tool for figuring out when to slot in recovery days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7igw1m"&gt;The Sport is also accurate for a hybrid. Usually, hybrid watches are god-awful at tracking GPS activity. However, the Sport was dead on with my Apple Watch Series 7 across several runs. On a 3-mile run recorded by the Runkeeper app on my phone, the Sport reported 3.04 miles, and the Series 7 logged three miles. The Garmin said I was about 10 seconds faster per mile, but that granularity isn’t going to bother the casual users this watch caters to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZQGpK"&gt;I will say if you like heart rate zone training, this isn’t a good choice. Hybrid watches are never that great when it comes to looking at your stats mid-exercise, and the Sport isn’t an exception. That made it hard for me to evaluate real-time heart rate accuracy, but in reviewing my data afterward showed my max and average heart rate, as well as heart rate zone data was nearly identical to the Series 7. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UGq80rPAyq6R9W6n-YkUYfBz6F0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162059/vsong_220110_4962_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get a good number of sensors for more advanced health metrics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B3NAwc"&gt;This watch also wouldn’t be my pick for more intense outdoor activities like rock climbing or dirt biking. This is more suited to indoor workouts and shorter distance running or biking (5K-10K). You could take it into the pool, as it’s got 5 ATM of water resistance, and it withstood showers and dishwashing with no problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3epLe"&gt;Fitness-wise, my big complaint is the same as every other Garmin watch I’ve tested: the Garmin Connect app is a hot mess. Editing settings is like discovering more menus within other menus — a real Russian Doll scenario. It’s unnecessarily complicated to find what you’re looking for. Don’t get me wrong — I love how granular Garmin’s data gets. What I don’t love is how it’s organized. It’s fine for viewing your day-to-day data, but if you want to get into your historical data over time? Be prepared to decipher a color-coded calendar view, at least five menu categories for health and fitness metrics, as well as dozens of subcategories and graphs for each individual metric.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I recommend linking to Strava or another fitness app for a better experience. If you like the social aspect like challenges and ribbing your buddies, integrating with another service is probably going to be a better experience, even if it means you need two apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="d0huXQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not charging you the ability to access your data, and that’s something we will continue to do and that we feel very strongly about.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nhEYpq"&gt;Overall, Garmin’s given Fitbit a real run for its money when it comes to basic trackers. Between this and the Fitbit Luxe, I’d pick the Sport. Although it’s more expensive at $179.99, you get all this data in the app for free. To get the most out of Fitbit’s app, you’ll eventually need a Fitbit Premium subscription. Advanced sleep insights and readiness scores, for example, are something you need to pay extra for once the free trial period is over. Over time, that makes the Sport the more affordable option. During my briefing with Garmin at CES, I asked whether the company would ever consider switching to a subscription model like many of its competitors. Phil McClendon, Garmin’s project lead for the Venu 2 Plus, said the company wouldn’t lock data behind a paywall. “It’s your data,” McClendon said. “We’re not charging you the ability to access your data, and that’s something we will continue to do and that we feel very strongly about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d16v_LAIA5wfSwAoxgH2NZWjnnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162057/vsong_220110_4962_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vivomove Sport is accurate, but while I appreciate how granular Garmin data is, I wish the app was simpler to navigate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8MBC3r"&gt;I’ve liked Garmin’s other hybrids, but they were always too pricey to be worth it for casual users, aka the core audience for hybrid watches. Fossil’s hybrids are elegant, and the e-ink is super cool. However, they’re a pain to navigate after a while, and it’s not a good choice for activity tracking or health features. The Withings Steel HR is the closest alternative, but its tiny notification window isn’t as helpful. Putting aside aesthetic preferences, I’d recommend the Steel HR if elegance and simplified wellness is more of your goal. The Sport is better if you’re a more active person — or hoping to become one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EbLsNP"&gt;Basically, if you’re looking to commit to regularly running or cycling 5Ks but not at the expense of style, the Sport is the way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft commissions third-party review of its harassment and discrimination policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g5uJlS7mQ7JFskczc3GTU_2DBqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70386921/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ys5FnN"&gt;Microsoft’s board of directors is hiring a law firm to review the company’s policies on sexual harassment and discrimination after years of complaints of wrongdoing at the company. &lt;a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56"&gt;The review&lt;/a&gt;, which will be conducted by law firm Arent Fox, will include a public transparency report “assessing the effectiveness of the company’s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG2NWC"&gt;It will also include an assessment of Microsoft’s previous investigation into allegations against the company’s co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates. &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2022/microsoft-board-approves-outside-review-of-harassment-and-discrimination-policies-including-assessment-of-bill-gates-investigation/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that this review won’t reinvestigate Gates’ affair with a company employee in the year 2000. Bill Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the Microsoft board&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/16/22439640/bill-gates-microsoft-board-alleged-affair-investigation"&gt;reportedly left&lt;/a&gt; before Microsoft had completed its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmIEuf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s review will assess an internal email chain full of complaints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W7zg8t"&gt;The board report will also examine multiple allegations of discrimination and harassment that were surfaced in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295647/microsoft-workers-sexual-harassment-stories-internal-email-chain"&gt;internal Microsoft email chain in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Allegations of sexual harassment, stories about demeaning behavior, and sexist comments were all highlighted in the email chain where Microsoft employees complained the company didn’t take any action in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8v3zd"&gt;Microsoft was also the subject of a five-year lawsuit over fair pay that was originally filed in 2015. The lawsuit, filed by former Microsoft employee Katie Moussouris, claimed that the company unfairly discriminated against female employees because of their gender. Moussouris dropped her case in 2020, but is still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22331972/pay-equity-now-pledge-katie-moussouris-microsoft-lawsuit"&gt;fighting for fair pay&lt;/a&gt; across the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xRgX8"&gt;“We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” says Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement accompanying the &lt;a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56"&gt;announcement of the review&lt;/a&gt;. “I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0YSRN"&gt;Here’s what Microsoft says its review will address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HWRaP1"&gt;“It will lead to the public release of a transparency report assessing the effectiveness of the company’s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies. This will include a review of concerns raised by employees in 2019 in the “In Need of Assistance” email thread, steps the company has taken to respond to these concerns, and additional steps that could further strengthen these safeguards. The review will also include an analysis of policies, practices, and commitments to create a safe, inclusive work environment.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FC1zfw"&gt;“The report will summarize the results of any sexual harassment investigations during this same timeframe against members of the Board of Directors and the company’s Senior Leadership Team, including the allegations that a Board committee investigated beginning in 2019 involving Bill Gates.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TRQIxX"&gt;“It will assess the steps that have been taken to hold employees, including executives, accountable for sexual harassment or gender discrimination.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8e0C6i"&gt;“The report will include data on the number of sexual harassment cases investigated and their resolution.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Google TV exploring fitness, smart home control, and other new features for 2022  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nMPLZmJtuD2yxiXtayzLEXNBVBc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70386917/DSCF2108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s 2020 Chromecast with Google TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="imcrc4"&gt;Google TV’s director of product management Rob Caruso has outlined what the company’s plans are for its TV operating system in 2022 in a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/whats-next-for-google-tv?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2"&gt;new interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While Caruso stopped short of making any specific feature announcements, he said that the company is interested in offering fitness and video conferencing services though Google TV, and better smart home controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tE0gw"&gt;Caruso called fitness a “big area of exploration,” and cited Android’s recent smart home control changes (which, for example, made them easily accessible from a phone’s power menu) as a clue for what might come to Google TV. Zoom was cited as a potential addition to the platform (Google’s own &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/duo/answer/10079968?hl=en-GB"&gt;Duo video calling service&lt;/a&gt; is already available), and he said Google is also interested in expanding the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820622/google-tv-pluto-live-tab"&gt;free live programming available on its platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TciJpg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Amazon have added similar features to their smart TV devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVyF8j"&gt;Caruso also spoke to the situation with Netflix on Google TV. Although the video streaming service is supported on Google’s platform, it doesn’t make use of some of its advanced features. &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes that Netflix shows can’t be added to Google TV’s OS-level watchlist, for example. Caruso didn’t promise that this will change, but said that he hopes the situation will improve as Google builds worthwhile new features into its OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9bRi5"&gt;Although Google’s TV operating system doesn’t typically get as much attention as its Android mobile OS, it’s still used by millions of devices around the world. As of this month, Google says there are around 110 million Android TV devices in use globally, and that seven of the top 10 smart TV manufacturers use its software. This includes both Android TV itself, as well as devices running the newer Google TV launcher alongside it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcXvwA"&gt;The areas of focus are similar to what are available on competing smart TV platforms from Apple and Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple’s Fitness Plus service&lt;/a&gt; allows you to stream workouts to an Apple TV, and Zoom is available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850298/amazon-fire-tv-omni-zoom-calls"&gt;some of Amazon’s TV devices&lt;/a&gt;. But given the huge reach of Google’s TV operating system, it would be good to see it reach parity with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urOwKM"&gt;No firm release dates for any of these new features were provided, but Caruso said that he hopes some might be introduced “at some point later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Massive cyber attack’ hits Ukraine government websites as tensions with Russia escalate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mf-TezB86FvhGu8qaH5_r15a61w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70386899/acastro_170621_1777_0001_fin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UWXuoY"&gt;Hackers attacked a number of Ukrainian government websites on Friday, temporarily disabling sites and leaving messages warning readers to “be afraid and expect the worse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yi0Nap"&gt;A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry described the incident as a “massive cyber attack,” according to reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/several-ukraine-ministry-websites-struck-by-likely-cyberattack?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-says-massive-cyber-attack-has-shut-down-government-websites-12515487"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but noted that no content on the sites had been altered and no personal data had been leaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmZg8v"&gt;Websites for the government’s cabinet, security and defense councils, and ministry for education were among those affected. “Our specialists are already working on restoring the work of IT systems, and the cyber police opened an investigation,” said the spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ACJBUx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Russian troops have been gathering on Ukraine’s border for weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCJ5ds"&gt;Despite their apparently superficial nature, the attacks are significant given escalating tensions in the region. An estimated 100,000 Russian troops are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/07/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html"&gt;currently gathered on the borders of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, and Western intelligence agencies warn that a full-blown invasion could be imminent. Russian troops and Russian-backed insurgents have occupied areas of the country since 2014, including the Crimea peninsula and parts of the Donbas region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfHugT"&gt;Although there is no clear culprit for today’s cyberattacks, officials are already suggesting that Russia may be responsible. “It’s too early to draw conclusions, but there is a long record of Russian assaults against Ukraine,” a Ukrainian government spokesperson &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-says-massive-cyber-attack-has-shut-down-government-websites-12515487"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The EU’s head of foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, told reporters this morning that he “has no evidence who was responsible” but “we can imagine who is behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMCeSt"&gt;Russia has previously deployed cyberattacks as a prelude to ground warfare, as during its 2008 invasion of Georgia. Weeks before Russian troops marched into the country — taking control of two separatist regions that it still holds today, Abkhazia and South Ossetia — cyberattacks were used to target &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html"&gt;Georgian government sites and web infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. Similar attacks spiked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/29/5759138/malware-activity-spiked-as-russia-annexed-crimea"&gt;during the Russian annexation of Crimea&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. In such cases, the intent of attacks can be as much to sow confusion as it is to disable critical services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTMYHX"&gt;As part of the attacks on Ukraine’s government websites this week, messages were posted in three languages: Ukrainian, Polish, and Russian. “Ukrainian! All your personal data was uploaded to the public network. All data on the computer is destroyed, it is impossible to restore it,” reads the message. “All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8MDmY"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Sky News&lt;/em&gt;, the EU has called an emergency meeting to respond to the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla now lets you buy some merch in Dogecoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OghnujLUgb5CDXHcVhzjNj5iXUo=/49x0:1834x1190/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70386815/giga_doge.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giga Texas Belt Buckle now costs 835 DOGE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WSNT0"&gt;Tesla now lets customers buy select items of merchandise using Dogecoin, the company’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1481873421390680065"&gt;CEO Elon Musk has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Products buyable with the meme-based cryptocurrency include the Cyberquad for Kids (12,020 doge / around $2,320), the &lt;a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/giga-texas-belt-buckle?sku=1758879-00-A"&gt;Giga Texas Belt Buckle&lt;/a&gt; (835 doge / around $161) and the Cyberwhistle (300 doge / around $58). &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-starts-accepting-dogecoin-for-merchandise-meme-coin-spike-2022-1?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Dogecoin was up 16 percent to around $0.20 following the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUBfDC"&gt;The initiative was initially announced by Musk on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470703708677840896"&gt;on December 14th&lt;/a&gt; when he said that the company would “see how it goes” with the cryptocurrency payment option. It’s unclear if or when Tesla might eventually accept payment for its vehicles in Dogecoin, which Musk has previously said may be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929"&gt;his favorite cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kSMNPi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1481873421390680065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2e42m"&gt;The initiative appears to be supported outside the US, with the &lt;a href="https://shop.tesla.com/en_gb/product/s3xy-mug?sku=8764620-00-A"&gt;S3XY Mug&lt;/a&gt; buyable with Dogecoin from the UK Tesla store for 150 doge (around $29). As of this writing, Dogecoin now appears to be the only way to buy certain items, as their regular payment icons have disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6UYrx"&gt;Support for Dogecoin purchases comes just months after Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22347905/tesla-bitcoin-payment-us-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;started accepting Bitcoin for car purchases&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;cease the practice 49 days later&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns about the use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,” Elon Musk said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7Jb3rYXZ9_reK4xbRfq0Q44UMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168399/image.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S3XY Mug, available for 150 doge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tSrIjf"&gt;Dogecoin currently doesn’t consume anywhere near the same amount of energy per transaction as Bitcoin, according to &lt;a href="https://www.trgdatacenters.com/most-environment-friendly-cryptocurrencies/"&gt;research from TRG Datacenters&lt;/a&gt;. But Dogecoin is still an energy-intensive proof-of-work cryptocurrency, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;digital currency economist Alex de Vries explained in May&lt;/a&gt;. Its smaller energy use per transaction is largely because it’s currently a less valuable asset than Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqbrdT"&gt;For his part, Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392974251011895300"&gt;said in May&lt;/a&gt; that he was working with Dogecoin developers to “improve system transaction efficiency.” He’s not been shy about his support of the cryptocurrency, which started life as a joke &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)"&gt;based on the Doge meme&lt;/a&gt;. “Lots of people I talked to on the production lines at Tesla or building rockets at SpaceX own Doge,” Musk &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/elon-musk-on-his-crypto-portfolio-and-why-he-supports-dogecoin.html"&gt;told CNBC in October&lt;/a&gt;. “They aren’t financial experts or Silicon Valley technologists. That’s why I decided to support Doge, it felt like the people’s crypto.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dto04"&gt;Another of Elon Musk’s ventures, SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427588/spacex-dogecoin-satellite-doge-1-to-the-moon"&gt;started accepting payment in Dogecoin in May&lt;/a&gt; and next year plans to send a satellite named DOGE-1 to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delays Cybertruck to early 2023, says report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AUTOMOBILE-TESLA-CYBERTRUCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHnCt22c8lkRBRGEyw5o56tjyqs=/99x0:5469x3580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382686/1183828053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9xAyc"&gt;Tesla has never been fantastic at meeting deadlines, so it’s not too surprising that the company’s ambitious electric pickup — the Cybertruck — is running a little late. Recently, reference to a 2022 production schedule was scrubbed from its website, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-tesla-delays-initial-production-cybertruck-early-2023-source-2022-01-13/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that production of the vehicle won’t begin until the first quarter of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOP5XX"&gt;The Cybertruck was originally announced in 2019, with Tesla promising that the vehicle would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;rolling off production lines&lt;/a&gt; in late 2021. Then, in August that year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;full production was delayed&lt;/a&gt; to some time in 2022. Now, that deadline seems to have been waived, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxWy3O"&gt;Changes to the Cybertruck order page were first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Ftesla-cybertruck-delayed-2022.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F13%2F22881646%2Ftesla-cybertruck-production-date-2022-removed-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The site originally told buyers: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” Now it says: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears,” with archives showing that reference to the year was removed &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211219200808/https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#payment"&gt;at the end of December 20201&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evz7po"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, citing a “person familiar with the matter,” the delay is a result of “changing features and functions” that Tesla is introducing to make the vehicle more attractive in a growing market for electric pickups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwQz5O"&gt;Ford recently committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865664/ford-f150-lightning-double-production-150000-annual"&gt;doubling production of its F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, which it says will start shipping in the first half of 2022; buzzy newcomer Rivian finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;started shipping its first R1Ts to customers&lt;/a&gt;; while brands like Hummer and Chevy have their own electric trucks scheduled for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;late 2022&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;late 2023&lt;/a&gt; releases respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sfuXMn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the chip shortage, pandemic, and design challenges could all have contributed to delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jRMyUS"&gt;Other factors that might have contributed to the delay include external challenges, like the ongoing pandemic and global chip shortage (which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;affected all automakers&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Cybertruck-specific problems. The vehicle’s angular look is controversial, attracting awe and scorn in equal measure, but it certainly comes with unique design challenges, like the problem of creating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828220/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-drone-shot-windshield-wiper-elon-musk"&gt;huge windshield wiper&lt;/a&gt; to cover the mammoth front window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhuzHT"&gt;Ramping up production on the Cybertruck might also be a relatively low priority for Tesla considering its other vehicles have had fantastic years. The Model 3 became the first EV to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744481/tesla-model-3-tops-sales-charts-europe-electric-vehicles"&gt;top monthly sales charts in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863751/tesla-delivered-one-million-vehicles-2021"&gt;delivered close to 1 million cars&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 — an impressive 87 percent increase on shipments in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="einkVk"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck can afford to delay a little, but the company risks losing potential customers as it does. We should know more about the vehicle’s future soon, though. Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1466800941269667841"&gt;promised to share&lt;/a&gt; an official “product roadmap update” for the Cybertruck on the next Tesla earnings call. That’s scheduled for January 26th. Not long to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGUJx0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 14th, 3:18AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with Reuters report of a delay to Q1 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG’s developer is suing Apple, Google, and the developer of lucrative PUBG lookalike Free Fire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdM5PZpvs6i6DANsf5YzSeAubPM=/91x0:1077x657/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70386271/PUBG_CPP_2_1168x657.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG-maker Krafton filed a big lawsuit Monday.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Krafton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5FcXI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;-maker Krafton filed a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21179291-krafton-lawsuit-against-sea-apple-and-google"&gt;big lawsuit Monday&lt;/a&gt;: it’s suing the developer of two mobile games that it accuses of copying &lt;em&gt;PUBG: Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the hit PC battle royale shooter, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it’s suing Apple and Google for distributing those games on their app stores. Krafton even accuses Google of hosting &lt;em&gt;YouTube&lt;/em&gt; videos with gameplay of the two games in question, as well as “numerous posts containing a feature-length Chinese film that is nothing more than a blatantly infringing live-action dramatization of &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEIHWr"&gt;The games Krafton takes issue with are called &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Free Fire Max&lt;/em&gt;, offered by developer Garena. On both the App Store and Google Play, they show up as &lt;em&gt;Garena Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Garena Free Fire Max&lt;/em&gt;. Both are available for free with in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvEfrw"&gt;According to Krafton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YztuSd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Free Fire Max&lt;/em&gt; extensively copy numerous aspects of &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, both individually and in combination, including &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds’&lt;/em&gt; copyrighted unique game opening “air drop” feature, the game structure and play, the combination and selection of weapons, armor, and unique objects, locations, and the overall choice of color schemes, materials, and textures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="83nhLy"&gt;Krafton alleges Garena has earned “hundreds of millions of dollars” from sales from the apps and that Apple and Google have “similarly earned a substantial amount of revenue from their distribution of &lt;em&gt;Free Fire.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YsV-icHwtJtHnpDjWYzaIzWiN54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167824/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_5.37.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Krafton&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the lawsuit, Krafton compiled comparisons like this to make its case against Garena.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GBI9HR"&gt;Krafton claims that on December 21st, it took a few actions: it asked Garena to “immediately stop its exploitation of &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Free Fire Max,&lt;/em&gt;” which Garena apparently refused; it asked Apple and Google to stop distributing the games, which are both still available on both app stores; and it asked YouTube to remove videos featuring &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Free Fire Max&lt;/em&gt; gameplay “that include elements that blatantly infringe &lt;em&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt; and, separately, the infringing feature-length film,” which Krafton says YouTube hasn’t done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMRuVD"&gt;In case you’re wondering about that film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JJlybn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update on the below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The directors said it's not a PUBG movie, despite basically being a PUBG movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Krafton said they are considering suing given the similarities to the PUBG IP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. You can watch it with English subs here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/lS1SfdTRhj"&gt;https://t.co/lS1SfdTRhj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pBdcsqZttn"&gt;https://t.co/pBdcsqZttn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1427026510913880073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="smoHXo"&gt;Krafton also notes that Garena sold a game in Singapore in 2017 that “copied” &lt;em&gt;PUBG: Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;. While claims regarding that were settled, there was no license agreement established, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oP8pg9"&gt;I’ll admit that I hadn’t heard of &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; before this lawsuit, but I’ve since learned that it’s quite lucrative. &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; earned $1.1 billion in player spending in 2021, according to data that analytics firm Sensor Tower shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an amount that was up 48 percent from 2020. While the total dollar amount is quite a bit less than the astonishing $2.9 billion that &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; earned in player spending last year, &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile’s&lt;/em&gt; figures were up only seven percent year-over-year, reports Sensor Tower. That could suggest &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile’s&lt;/em&gt; growth is slowing down just as &lt;em&gt;Free Fire’s&lt;/em&gt; is skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9ebCU"&gt;We also checked with another analytics firm, Appfigures, and while the data was different, it still suggested that &lt;em&gt;Free Fire &lt;/em&gt;is catching up. &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile Lite&lt;/em&gt;, and the China- and India-specific versions of &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; earned a combined $639 million in revenue last year, according to Appfigures, while &lt;em&gt;Free Fire&lt;/em&gt; earned $414 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFvCMO"&gt;Apple and Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Jason Golz, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://www.sea.com/home"&gt;Garena parent company Sea&lt;/a&gt;, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that “Krafton’s claims are groundless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CooJaG"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about Amazon workers fighting the company’s robotic HR response to COVID</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MHLsd1"&gt;NBC News has published &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/ailing-amazon-workers-struggle-find-covid-tests-rcna11942"&gt;a great report&lt;/a&gt; on the struggles Amazon employees face trying to get tested for COVID after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22584386/amazon-end-onsite-covid-19-testing-us-warehouses"&gt;stopped onsite testing last summer&lt;/a&gt;, and the HR quagmire they could end up in when reporting their results or dealing with illness-related PTO. The story is well worth a read, as it delves into Amazon’s policies and systems, and gives a voice to the employees they affect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChnNLI"&gt;The author of the report spoke to workers who faced breakthrough cases and unexpected costs as they tried to get tested for COVID, struggling with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632378/pandemic-ransomware-health-risks"&gt;overburdened&lt;/a&gt; and difficult-to-navigate healthcare system. “I really wish they would bring free COVID testing back to us,” says one employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8sy6rk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One employee says Amazon’s systems “take the human out of human resources”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTbwDm"&gt;The story also shows the problems they could face if they test positive, or start developing symptoms. Amazon’s workers are supposed to get 40 hours of paid leave after a positive test or exposure, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872866/amazon-coronavirus-changed-pto-policy-cdc-guidance-update"&gt;an updated Amazon policy&lt;/a&gt;. But many of those that spoke to NBC reported that they ran into difficulties or errors trying to get time off. One worker said that the company’s “self-service kind of H.R. system” seemed designed to “to kind of take the human out of human resources.” That system has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745029/amazon-warehouse-hr-new-york-times"&gt;faced criticism in the past&lt;/a&gt; for everything from underpaying employees to mistakenly firing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTdYMh"&gt;But if the system is robotic, it seems to have broken down — workers told NBC News that they found it nearly impossible to get help if they test positive, and talked about systems improperly marking them as having use paid time off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECsC67"&gt;Trying to contact an actual human isn’t much better. One employee quoted in the report talked about how the company’s phone lines were swamped: “I could not reach a live person no matter how hard I tried.” She ended up speaking to someone in person about how she needed to get tested after finding out one of her close co-workers had COVID. A contractor that works at Amazon’s COVID-19 hotline told NBC News there were 1,700 calls on hold at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzuxZJ"&gt;The company told NBC that it was looking into reports of the time-off issues, and that it offers incentives and events to help employees get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imMaWp"&gt;If you’re interested in the saga of how Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465357/amazon-industrial-athlete-warehouse-worker-wellness-pamphlet"&gt;manages the health of its massive workforce&lt;/a&gt;, the report is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/ailing-amazon-workers-struggle-find-covid-tests-rcna11942"&gt;absolutely worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. It provides some great insight into the results of Amazon’s workplace protection policies, which have sparked employee protests and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22810754/amazon-new-york-ag-reinstate-fired-worker-health-safety-covid"&gt;legal pressure&lt;/a&gt; in some cases. Even if you’re not interested in Amazon specifically, you’ll probably get something out of reading the words of the employees having to deal with these systems while also making sure Amazon’s packages keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>School employee stole 3,000 Apple iPods earmarked for Native American kids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPod stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cx0wmx8o8BXuRQ0XGC74E1FXdeE=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385965/IMG_6762.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BaYfWr"&gt;She ran a program that used iPods to teach reading and math to underprivileged Native American schoolkids living on tribal land. Now, 46-year-old Kristy Stock of New Mexico is getting 18 months in prison for stealing 3,000 of them, which she resold for a personal gain of over $800,000 between 2013 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Td7egN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-new-mexico-school-district-employee-sentenced-18-months-federal-prison-stealing"&gt;That’s according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland (via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/woman-sentenced-to-prison-for-stealing-over-3000-ipods-intended-for-native-american-students-194009681.html?src=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and Stock isn’t the first who’s been sentenced as part of this scheme — it all seems to center around around 36-year-old Colorado resident Saurabh Chawla, who bought up stolen electronics and other goods and resold them on eBay and Amazon. Law enforcement raided him in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-eastern-shore-resident-sentenced-more-five-years-federal-prison-conspiring-sell"&gt;according to an earlier press release&lt;/a&gt;, and he bought stolen iPads from another New Mexico school district as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIMM60"&gt;Perhaps even more significantly, Chawla worked with a FedEx distribution center manager from Delaware named Joseph Kukta to steal packages before they made it to customers like Walmart, with Chawla paying him $1.5 million according to court documents. Those thefts included shipments of Nike sneakers and devices from Apple, Epson, Kenwood, and Magellan, among other merchandise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ7s0N"&gt;“Kukta selected specific packages which he believed, based on the shippers of the packages, contained high-end electronics or other merchandise of value that could be easily resold,” reads a portion of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/delaware-facility-supervisor-sentenced-more-three-years-federal-prison-tax-evasion-and"&gt;yet another press release&lt;/a&gt;, which continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5iVz8w"&gt;In 2018, Kukta began to also steal packages from FedEx trailers that were loaded for delivery to a retail Store in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5eT1cM"&gt;Kukta went to the FedEx facility on Sundays, holidays, or other times when employees were not at the facility, and removed the packages he previously identified from the FedEx trailers. Kukta attempted to avoid detection by turning off the lights at the facility and blocking certain surveillance cameras with cardboard boxes and other objects. Kukta loaded the stolen packages into his truck or into vehicles operated by FedEx contractors and parked at the facility, then drove the vehicles to his rented storage unit in Seaford, where he unloaded and stored the items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="V9HP0w"&gt;It’s not clear if Stock, the school district employee, took iPods away from Native American schoolkids who needed them, or simply ones that went unused. One court document states that the iPods were purchased in bulk with federal grant money, and the school district stored unused ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1955x"&gt;In November 2018, Stock allegedly told Chawla that she would check “the school’s iPod inventory and let you know what I can get headed your way” for “Black Friday,” but was apparently only able to steal 30 that time, saying that she had “to keep some on hand through year end for the students.” I suppose that’s nice of her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RGHx5f"&gt;Chawla was sentenced to 66 months in prison; Kukta got 42 months; James Bender of Maryland, who let Chawla use his eBay and PayPal accounts to sell the stolen goods, was sentenced to a year and a day. Chawla also agreed to forfeit at least $3.5 million worth of assets, with the court seizing seven bank accounts, a 2013 Tesla Model S, and forcing him to sell &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/25835-E-Dry-Creek-Pl-Aurora-CO-80016/87622999_zpid/"&gt;a two-story, five-bedroom home in Aurora, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; that he purchased with fraud money. Kukta will pay $1.1 million and forfeit an additional $1.88 million in assets, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/delaware-facility-supervisor-sentenced-more-three-years-federal-prison-tax-evasion-and"&gt;according to the DA’s office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oktVmL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96QZy5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Orbit launches first satellite mission after SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rp1PM_CUIxFOiXuj8IasSTUJHAI=/179x0:2030x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385949/Virgin_Orbit_88.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Orbit’s Cosmic Girl and LauncherOne just after rocket separation on a previous flight&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Orbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vsuzvK"&gt;This afternoon, small satellite launcher Virgin Orbit successfully lofted seven tiny satellites into orbit around Earth, marking the third successful mission for the Virgin Galactic spinoff company. The payloads consisted of &lt;a href="https://virginorbit.com/above-the-clouds/"&gt;various research satellites&lt;/a&gt; for the Department of Defense, along with three small satellites from companies SatRevolution and Spire Global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQU1fJ"&gt;The launch comes less than a week after Virgin Orbit’s stock began publicly trading for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637711/richard-branson-virgin-orbit-public-spac-satellite-launch"&gt;Virgin Orbit announced in August its plan to go public&lt;/a&gt; through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, making it one of three small rocket launch companies to follow the trend in 2021. On Friday, January 7th, Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart rang the Nasdaq opening bell, while the company put a model of its primary rocket, LauncherOne, on display in New York City’s Times Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J3fmbE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;less than a week after Virgin Orbit’s stock began publicly trading for the first time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ON7DJ2"&gt;Virgin Orbit is one of many rocket companies that have cropped up in the last few decades, aimed at specifically launching small- to medium-sized satellites into orbit. However, the company’s approach to getting these satellites into space is a bit unique compared to its competitors. Instead of launching vertically from the ground, Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne rocket is designed to take off from underneath the wing of a carrier aircraft, a refurbished Boeing 747 called Cosmic Girl. The plane is meant to take LauncherOne up to an altitude of approximately 35,000 feet, where the rocket is then released. In mid-air, LauncherOne ignites its main engine and propels its payloads the rest of the way into Earth’s orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfHGCZ"&gt;Today’s flight, called “Above the Clouds,” began at 4:39PM ET, when Cosmic Girl took off from a runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, where Virgin Orbit has a testing facility. The plane flew out west over the Pacific Ocean, where LauncherOne was released at 5:52PM ET. Flying the plane for this mission was Virgin Orbit’s pilot, Eric Bippert. He was accompanied in the cockpit by Matthew Stannard, or Stanny, a test pilot for the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom who has been seconded to Virgin Orbit. Stanny was &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59972909"&gt;the one to initiate LauncherOne’s release&lt;/a&gt; from underneath Cosmic Girl’s wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4phaI"&gt;Virgin Orbit’s launch occurred on the same day as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1481699225675067395?s=20"&gt;SpaceX’s second launch of the year&lt;/a&gt;, which also sent a crop of small satellites into orbit on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket out of Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX’s launch, called Transporter-3, hoisted a whopping 105 small satellites into orbit, deploying them one by one into space. Such a flight is often referred to as a rocket rideshare, and it’s another option for small satellite manufacturers to get their payloads into space. Since SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has a bigger capacity than a smaller rocket like LauncherOne, it can carry a bunch of small satellites at once into space, a bit like a cosmic carpool. SpaceX aims to launch at least three dedicated rocket rideshares a year through its Smallsat Rideshare Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="JBOPgj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today’s flight was called “Above the Clouds”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h1yZWy"&gt;Rocket rideshares have their downsides, though. For one thing, small satellite manufacturers often need to wait until enough satellites are packed onto one rocket in order to launch. There are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18277344/space-situational-awareness-air-force-tracking-sso-a-spaceflight-cubesats"&gt;some logistical issues that can come with launching so many satellites at once&lt;/a&gt;. Dedicated small launch providers like Virgin Orbit can tailor their missions to just a few customers and can, in theory, provide a quicker route to the launchpad. In fact, Virgin Orbit claims that Spire’s satellite was added relatively last minute to today’s flight. “In just under two weeks, we got them on board,” Tony Gingiss, Virgin Orbit’s COO, said during a press conference ahead of the launch. “Within 24 hours of signing the contract, we already had them integrated into the fairing” — the nosecone on top of the rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DykOGc"&gt;Of course, Virgin Orbit will need to up its launch cadence in order to offer a rapid path to space for customers. So far, the company is averaging about six months between launches. But Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart says the company is targeting six launches this year, which would double the launch cadence. Two of those launches are supposed to take place out of Spaceport Cornwall in the UK, established at the Cornwall Airport Newquay. &lt;/p&gt;
