    <title>Epic v. Apple judge rules Fortnite’s Peely can appear naked in court</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7vz312XXunEVo09hNPikh7yePQ=/0x1:581x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840700/peely.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peely the banana.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fREBOK"&gt;One of the more bizarre moments of this year’s &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial was when proceedings got derailed by an exchange about whether Peely the banana — a recurring &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;character — should be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429267/epic-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-trial-peely-day-6"&gt;expected to wear clothes in court&lt;/a&gt;. Apple suggested Peely ought to wear clothes in federal court and showed him in a tuxedo; Epic argued the suit was unnecessary. And you better believe the judge’s ruling, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;released today&lt;/a&gt;, has come to a final conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="H5KlDq"&gt;With respect to the appropriateness of Peely’s “dress,” the Court understood Apple merely to be “dressing” Peely in a tuxedo for federal court, as jest to reflect the general solemnity of a federal court proceeding. As Mr. Weissinger later remarked, and with which the Court agrees, Peely is “just a banana man,” additional attire was not necessary but informative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vPICVa"&gt;The moment in question came on day six of the trial, when Apple’s attorney was cross-examining Matthew Weissinger, Epic’s VP of marketing, in order to offer a tutorial of how exactly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; works. During the exchange, Apple’s attorney noted that they’d chosen to show Peely in his “Agent Peely” guise, since “We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBX5KS"&gt;Now, obviously, this was a joke. It was a small lighthearted moment during an antitrust-focused court case. But after Apple criticized Epic for hosting the Itch.io storefront and with it, its “so-called adult games,” Epic’s attorney simply couldn’t let Apple get away with implying that its naked banana was inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fh9hyX"&gt;“If we could just put on the screen a picture of Peely — is there anything inappropriate about Peely without clothes?” Epic’s attorney asked Weissinger two hours later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abuxwh"&gt;“It’s just a banana man,” Weissinger was forced to respond. (NB: We originally transcribed this exchange as “just a banana, ma’am,” but the court’s transcription is final).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDZhc6"&gt;In the end, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ judgement sensibly points out what basically everyone understood at the time: Peely’s “just a banana man” and “additional attire was not necessary.” Checkmate, Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7RtPR"&gt;You can check out the relevant section for yourself on page eight of the document below. Neither Epic nor Apple have publicly stated whether they plan to appeal this portion of the judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search is finally officially getting dark mode on desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mz9JHPyqhfC6N_T50-iFsO8FuG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840690/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGSLCz"&gt;Google is finally adding an official dark mode to search on desktops, letting those who prefer to avoid bright webpages complete their searches while bathed in inky gray (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/09/google-search-dark-theme-desktop/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/125141564/dark-theme-now-available-on-google-search-desktop"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, you can make the change by going to Settings &amp;gt; Search Settings &amp;gt; Appearance. There, you’ll be able to choose light, dark, or device default, which will automatically follow your computer’s mode. If you don’t see the Appearance option, you may have to wait a bit: Google says the setting will be “rolling out over the next few weeks,” as many of its updates do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZhkOf"&gt;Google has been toying with dark mode search for a while now — we noted that it was in testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276553/google-search-dark-mode-desktop"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. To take you behind the scenes a bit, since then, we’ve had a few staff members randomly get and lose dark mode as the test continued. Now, though, it’s finally official.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRn0GBEDPTLEw_s5Dgz0ETQrrmo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838618/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_5.00.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google results, but dark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NnFnMx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/09/google-search-dark-theme-desktop/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; some users seeing another quick toggle sun icon and that a few people have the option to enable the change on the mobile web version of Google. Neither change is mentioned in Google’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mb71dZ3ev1kw2TFhqZd0BgcznRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22838638/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_5.16.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have quick access to the setting via an “Appearance” link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n2fqA1"&gt;Of course, you’ve had options to search darkly before now — you could turn Google dark using browser plugins or use themes on alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo. Many of Google’s Android and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606644/google-maps-ios-dark-mode-widgets-share-location-imessage"&gt;iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21264056/google-app-dark-mode-android-ios"&gt;the main Google search app&lt;/a&gt;, have also had a dark mode for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEey1f"&gt;But Google making it officially available as a setting will make it much easier for those who just couldn’t be bothered to install an extension or switch search providers. Plus, it will hopefully alleviate the experience of logging on to a new device and trying to search for something, only to be blasted with the light of a thousand suns. Perhaps that’s a bit hyperbolic, but hey — all hail the darkness (and the small quality-of-life improvements).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch sues two alleged ‘hate raiders’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c658U8pXol5cqldiXEDcwMoULAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840688/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_hate_raid_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U7TAPZ"&gt;After months of combating a tidal wave of harassment campaigns targeting marginalized streamers, Twitch has filed a suit against two alleged “hate raiders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9ydKo"&gt;First &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitch-sues-users-over-alleged-hate-raids/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524416914/Twitch-Interactive-vs-Cruzzcontrol-and-CreatineOverdose"&gt;the suit&lt;/a&gt;, filed yesterday in US Federal Court, names two defendants, CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose, and alleges the two were responsible in part for the rash of “hate raids” that have plagued Twitch since the beginning of August. In the lawsuit, Twitch said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gX0EGu"&gt;CruzzControl is responsible for nearly 3,000 bot accounts associated with hate raids. Bots developed and deployed by CruzzControl have been linked to various hate raid events, including those targeting black and LGBTQIA+ streamers with racist, homophobic, sexist, and other harassing content. CruzzControl has admitted to using bots to flood Twitch channels with harassing content. They have also demonstrated how the bots work so others can use similar methods to accomplish hate raids. Twitch has also linked CreatineOverdose directly to hate raids. For example, on August 15th, 2021, Defendant CreatineOverdose used their bot software to demonstrate how it could be used to spam Twitch channels with racial slurs, graphic descriptions of violence against minorities, and claims that the hate raiders are the “K K K.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AC8JyE"&gt;CreatineOverdose was one of the first accounts identified by streamers as being responsible for the hate raids, and there is at least one incident in which CreatineOverdose admitted to being a perpetrator in a streamer’s chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gi0232"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Man is really casually talkin in chats.&lt;br&gt;Feel like this shit is actually never going to stop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean it’s nothing new to me on this site but the fact it’s trending this month is sad. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitchSupport&lt;/a&gt; what are y’all doing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sucks to be left in the dark as ppl leave the site &lt;a href="https://t.co/2gKOMfrX8d"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2gKOMfrX8d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— a Beige Question Mark (@ItsWoofy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ItsWoofy/status/1428060621560557568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ogdW84"&gt;The suit does not identify either defendant beyond their Twitch usernames but does say that both reside in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="AbfmQt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10745493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ww5RHo"&gt;Hate raids happen when malicious actors weaponize bots and the raid feature to spam streamers’ chats with racist, transphobic, and homophobic messages. Hate raids have happened on the platform for a while, but incidents have recently exploded uncontrollably with Black, brown, queer, and trans streamers suffering the majority of attacks. In response, streamers and Twitch community members created their own resources to combat hate raids while also vocally criticizing Twitch for not doing more or acting swiftly enough to protect its users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6zsXj"&gt;On September 1st, streamer &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen"&gt;ShineyPen&lt;/a&gt; organized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;A Day Off Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, which asked users to not stream or watch Twitch for a day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654534/streamers-twitch-walkout-viewership-drop"&gt;in order to bring attention to the problem&lt;/a&gt;. Twitch responded to the calls for action with several updates to its safety features and a promise that more action was forthcoming. This suit is part of that action. A Twitch spokesperson said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pV0ez5"&gt;Yesterday, Twitch filed a complaint in U. S. Federal Court against individuals involved in the recent chat-based attacks against marginalized streamers. The malicious actors involved have been highly motivated in breaking our Terms of Service, creating new waves of fake bot accounts designed to harass Creators even as we continually update our sitewide protections against their rapidly evolving behaviors. While we have identified and banned thousands of accounts over the past weeks, these actors continue to work hard on creative ways to circumvent our improvements, and show no intention of stopping. We hope this Complaint will shed light on the identity of the individuals behind these attacks and the tools that they exploit, dissuade them from taking similar behaviors to other services, and help put an end to these vile attacks against members of our community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25ctiz"&gt;This Complaint is by no means the only action we’ve taken to address targeted attacks, nor will it be the last. Our teams have been working around the clock to update our proactive detection systems, address new behaviors as they emerge, and finalize new proactive, channel-level safety tools that we’ve been developing for months. Hate and harassment have no place on Twitch, and we know we have a lot more work to do–but we hope that these combined actions will help reduce the immediate and unacceptable harm that targeted attacks have been inflicting on our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jkR6bx"&gt;While hate raids are still happening on Twitch, affected users do see this suit positively. &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciaeverblack"&gt;Lucia Everblack&lt;/a&gt;, one of the organizers of #ADayOffTwitch, thinks this is a good step. “It obviously doesn’t address the larger issues about how this still continues to happen but does send a message that the people doing it can be found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guSLZd"&gt;Another streamer who started the &lt;a href="https://hateraidresponse.carrd.co/"&gt;Hate Raid Response website&lt;/a&gt; — a place where streamers can utilize and share tools, programs, and tips on how to prevent or stop hate raids — said, “This is a step in the right direction and for the gaming community at large: accountability. Nothing on the internet is actually anonymous and there are real life consequences to the things you say and do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvGQ5w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos’ second-generation Symfonisk lamp leaks with swappable lampshades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mFj2EB8WEceErfOrmcKLTnkc_zs=/1x0:1126x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840605/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_12.38.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYl1Wp"&gt;Ikea’s second-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;Symfonisk table lamp speaker&lt;/a&gt; has leaked thanks to a support document posted to Ikea’s Portuguese website (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/pl8xrt/new_symfonisk_lamp_v_2_leaked_pictures_and/"&gt;spotted by a Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; who claims to have encountered the lamp shades in a store), featuring a new design that streamlines the speaker-lamp’s base and adds the much-needed option to swap in different styles of lampshades, via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jank0/status/1436360409661927425"&gt;Janko Roettgers on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hbh2KY"&gt;Compared to the original Symfonisk table lamp, the new model appears to have ditched the platter-like base for a design that integrates the speaker controllers directly into the unit. But the biggest change is the lampshade component, which ditches the mushroom-like opaque glass shade for removable, swappable options. And like the original, the new model will support both Sonos’ multiroom audio system and Apple’s AirPlay 2 standard. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svw16KytOPN1gFW998gwq4PK0p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840160/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_12.35.29_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The different configuration options for the new Symfonisk speaker lamp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="slFp7F"&gt;The support document lists two different shade options: a cylindrical glass option that looks like an open-ended version of the original model’s shade and a new translucent fabric option. Both shades will be available in black and white color schemes and cost €20 (around $23.64) each, while the main speaker component is listed as costing €129 (around $152.49). For comparison, the original Symfonisk table lamp cost $179 when it was first released, which is roughly the same as the two separate pieces of the second-generation model together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D96EHJ"&gt;The new table lamp — which had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22464111/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak"&gt;previously rumored&lt;/a&gt; alongside the since-released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;Symfonisk picture frame speakers&lt;/a&gt; — has yet to be officially announced by Sonos or Ikea. That said, given that the device is already appearing in support documents, it’ll likely only be a matter of time before a more formal announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddubrP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: How smart are Facebook’s glasses? </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q7UCNc"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lbo34"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter are joined by &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; managing editor Alex Cranz and senior reporter Alex Heath to discuss Facebook’s newest hardware endeavor: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;sunglasses with cameras on them&lt;/a&gt;. Will this new iteration of smart glasses stick around? Or are we overthinking it? The cast dives in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOqwtY"&gt;Second half of the show focuses on next week’s Apple event. The crew discussed their predictions for the iPhone 13, a new Apple Watch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654606/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-wireless-connection-stream-data"&gt;and other products&lt;/a&gt; we may see announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;on September 14th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vimeo adds support for Apple’s iPhone 12 Dolby Vision HDR videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini has a regular wide and an ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-Gy_9aMsw9Dm47hIAqACFBvhLw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840216/vpavic_4279_20201107_0048.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K4R5Lr"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro launched last year with the ability to shoot video in Dolby Vision HDR — but for the most part, there hasn’t been anywhere to actually post or share those files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14OZyd"&gt;But now, almost a year after they were first announced (and just in time for Apple’s next iPhone announcement on Tuesday), &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2Fdolby-vision-support-apple-devices&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666520%2Fvimeo-apple-iphone-12-pro-dolby-vision-hdr-videos-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple, Dolby, and Vimeo are teaming up&lt;/a&gt; to allow iPhone 12 owners to post &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F601088734&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666520%2Fvimeo-apple-iphone-12-pro-dolby-vision-hdr-videos-support" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dolby Vision HDR videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syg9w4"&gt;Starting now, you’ll be able to upload Dolby Vision videos shot with iPhone 12 devices (either directly from an iPhone or from your computer after editing in a program like Final Cut Pro) to Vimeo, where anyone will be able to stream them. Dolby Vision videos on Vimeo will have a badge highlighting that they feature HDR content, so you’ll easily be able to tell (and to show off) the improved video quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_lTDWjZh8OtaerctVvkMv9Jzzd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839932/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_11.18.27_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JemWCk"&gt;Of course, you’ll still need a Dolby Vision-compatible device to &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; your iPhone 12-shot videos on, which (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;as Nilay noted in his review&lt;/a&gt;) can be a tricky bit of business. Furthermore, Vimeo is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; supporting Apple devices to start: an iPhone 8 or newer or second-gen iPad Pro. Alternatively, the company says that you can use an HDR-compatible Mac (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210980"&gt;see Apple’s list here&lt;/a&gt;) or an Apple TV 4K if you’ve got a Dolby Vision TV or display to connect them to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnz5FB"&gt;On the flip side, if you have another Dolby Vision streaming device (or a Windows computer), you still won’t be able to view Dolby Vision videos on Vimeo. For now, the feature is only available on iOS, tvOS, and macOS devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqml6E"&gt;But even if you’re still mostly stuck watching videos on Apple devices, the newly added Vimeo support means that it’ll at least be easier to share and view those Dolby Vision HDR videos, instead of requiring that you share files to a friend to view on their iPhone or iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcCxds"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ywPT_LKUcPUv2PxMKUNofqbq7fs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69840077/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhwS4B"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060628-epic-apple-injunction"&gt;a permanent injunction&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case on Friday morning, putting new restrictions on Apple’s App Store rules and bringing months of bitter legal jousting to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K45KuA"&gt;Under the new order, Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o8d1Ip"&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3PKLf8"&gt;In short, iOS apps must be allowed to direct users to payment options beyond those offered by Apple. The injunction is scheduled to take effect in 90 days — on December 9th — unless it is enjoined by a higher court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JZ0NQ2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rCrbJe"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060697-apple-epic-judgment"&gt;In a separate judgment&lt;/a&gt;, the court affirmed that Epic Games was in breach of its contract with Apple when it implemented the alternative payment system in the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; app. As a result, Epic must pay Apple 30 percent of all revenue collected through the system since it was implemented — a sum of more than $3.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6PPUKK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060631-apple-epic-judgement"&gt;In the full ruling&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Gonzalez Rogers explained her thinking on the issue in greater detail. Notably, the judge rejected both parties’ definition of the marketplace at issue in the case. “The relevant market here is digital mobile gaming transactions, not gaming generally and not Apple’s own internal operating systems related to the App Store,” Gonzalez Rogers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z37QEc"&gt;Under that market definition, “the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” she continued. “Nonetheless, the trial did show that Apple is engaging in anti-competitive conduct under California’s competition laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPgBwA"&gt;Reached for comment, Apple cast the ruling as a victory for the App Store model. “Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,” a representative said. “Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZYfhP"&gt;On Twitter, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney expressed disappointment in the order. “Today’s ruling isn’t a win for developers or for consumers,” Sweeney said. “Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xnw77f"&gt;The new restrictions include echoes of some provisional anti-steering restrictions already placed on Apple outside of the US. On September 1st, Apple agreed to allow outside signup links for “reader” apps like Netflix and Spotify, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;a regulatory investigation in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;a South Korean law&lt;/a&gt; opened the door to alternate payment systems, although the practical impacts of the law are still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njgk3L"&gt;Apple and Epic Games have been at odds for years over the transaction fee system in the iOS App Store, which Apple sees as a necessary operating cost but Epic sees as a monopolistic tax. The fight came to a head in August 2020 when Epic installed an alternative payment system in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to circumvent the App Store’s transaction fees. Apple responded by removing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the App Store, which sparked an immediate legal complaint from Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjbe9m"&gt;The subsequent trial was a brutal tug-of-war over the App Store model and Apple’s efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;maintain control over software on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, we learned about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;strange accounting methods&lt;/a&gt; and charm offensive to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;keep major players like Netflix using in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6gxfC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Epic v. Apple trial was bigger than Fortnite|102313" data-volume-uuid="2e5d0ec67" data-volume-id="102313" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-243" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdb9LQ"&gt;The ruling is likely to have significant impacts outside of Apple. Google is already facing a similar lawsuit from Epic Games over its own efforts to maintain the Google Play Store as the central source of software on Android, drawing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;elaborate deals with phone manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is adding encrypted backups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFguNpJIPg8_BLEaFfyg8VS-8sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839986/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="St5Dfm"&gt;WhatsApp will let its more than 2 billion users fully encrypt the backups of their messages, the Facebook-owned app &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs89Vr"&gt;The plan, which WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp_Security_Encrypted_Backups_Whitepaper.pdf"&gt;detailing in a white paper&lt;/a&gt; before rolling out to users on iOS and Android in the coming weeks, is meant to secure the backups WhatsApp users already send to either Google Drive or Apple’s iCloud, making them unreadable without an encryption key. WhatsApp users who opt into encrypted backups will be asked to save a 64-digit encryption key or create a password that is tied to the key. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ivf4g"&gt;“WhatsApp is the first global messaging service at this scale to offer end-to-end encrypted messaging and backups, and getting there was a really hard technical challenge that required an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage across operating systems,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/274vW_fxjVRLSpYPhqN0yc1MelE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839764/Whatsapp_E2EE_Backups.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RT2LJV"&gt;If someone creates a password tied to their account’s encryption key, WhatsApp will store the associated key in a physical hardware security module, or HSM, that is maintained by Facebook and unlocked only when the correct password is entered in WhatsApp. An HSM acts like a safety deposit box for encrypting and decrypting digital keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Ml5C"&gt;Once unlocked with its associated password in WhatsApp, the HSM provides the encryption key that in turn decrypts the account’s backup that is stored on either Apple or Google’s servers. A key stored in one of WhatsApp’s HSM vaults will become permanently inaccessible if repeated password attempts are made. The hardware itself is located in data centers owned by Facebook around the world to protect from internet outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2XVLT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We expect to get criticized by some for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jtuXHa"&gt;The system is designed to ensure that no one besides an account owner can gain access to a backup, the head of WhatsApp, Will Cathcart, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; He said the goal of letting people create simpler passwords is to make encrypted backups more accessible. WhatsApp will only know that a key exists in a HSM, not the key itself or the associated password to unlock it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yca9fq"&gt;The move by WhatsApp comes as governments around the world like India — WhatsApp’s largest market — are threatening to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;break the way that encryption works&lt;/a&gt;. “We expect to get criticized by some for this,” Cathcart said. “That’s not new for us ... I believe strongly that governments should be pushing us to have more security and not do the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGi2zp"&gt;WhatsApp’s announcement means the app is going a step further than Apple, which encrypts iMessages but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075033/apple-icloud-end-to-end-encryption-scrapped-fbi-reuters-report"&gt;still holds the keys to encrypted backups&lt;/a&gt;; that means Apple can assist with recovery, but also that it can be compelled to hand the keys over to law enforcement. Cathcart said WhatsApp has been working on making encrypted backups a reality for the past couple of years, and that while they are opt-in to start, he hopes, over time, to “have this be the way it works for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8EHqo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgogMR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KIYAkE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ upcoming MMO, is just a few weeks away from its September 28th PC launch. But at some point in the future, it could be offered on Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service, Richard Lawrence, studio director at Amazon Games, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcGx9n"&gt;“I’m fairly confident that at some point you’ll also see &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; on Luna,” Lawrence says. That could expand the number of potential players by a significant amount since Luna is available on lot of different devices, including, as of Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663811/amazon-luna-fire-tablet-chromebook-family-retro-channels"&gt;Chromebooks and Amazon Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OL83F7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear when the game might come to Luna, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azMWuK"&gt;However, the holdup on bringing the game to Luna is “more on the &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; side than anything else,” Lawrence says. He didn’t commit to a timeline for a potential Luna launch, as it sounds like there would be some hurdles to overcome before that would happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUsMle"&gt;“Luna specializes in this almost impossible idea of, ‘Oh, I can sling your complex PC experience down to many different devices,’” Lawrence explains. “And [&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;] is a very input-driven environment.” That means that if you don’t have a keyboard, mouse, and a dedicated screen or monitor for the game, it may not be as good of an experience, he says. In other words, playing an MMO designed for PC on a controller or on the iPhone 12 Mini’s small screen perhaps wouldn’t be the most optimal way to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O50lBl"&gt;Still, having &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; on Luna could be the kind of tentpole game that brings in new subscribers. Right now, Luna lets you play many games that are also available on other platforms and consoles, but &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; could be a standout title that likely wouldn’t be available on any other cloud gaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czXS55"&gt;Streaming &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; on Luna would also be an impressive showcase of Amazon’s AWS cloud infrastructure, which is the backbone of both the MMO and the cloud gaming service. It seems likely that Amazon would want to find a way to use its own game to promote its own cloud gaming service all running on its own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U59wjB"&gt;That all being said, we don’t know for certain if or when &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; will ever be playable on Luna — though based on Lawrence’s comments, it seems like you might be able to some day. In the near term, if you’re interested in &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, you might want to check it out on PC during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640656/amazon-games-new-world-mmo-open-beta-date"&gt;the open beta, which begins Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, or following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609898/new-world-mmo-amazon-delayed-release-launch-date"&gt;official launch on September 28th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Model S Plaid sets production EV record at Germany’s Nürburgring race course</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UvutfgUnFtPljDqccNkI8oCbERY=/121x0:2295x1449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839807/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_9.53.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo9WVSNG3yI" target="_blank"&gt;Touristen Niko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYSxGp"&gt;Tesla set a new lap record for a production electric vehicle at Germany’s famed Nürburgring race course. A brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt; completed the 12.9-mile lap in seven minutes and 30.9 seconds, beating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833702/porsche-taycan-nurburgring-time-nordschleife-record-break"&gt;record set in 2019 by a Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt; by 12 seconds. The new record was confirmed by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1436086743720251394"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hgb55"&gt;According to Musk, the Model S Plaid was “completely unmodified, [and] directly from [the] factory.” In a follow-up tweet, he said Tesla would take another crack at the Nürburgring using a “modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp;amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uDaZyg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ujp3q_aryRA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVVkSJ"&gt;How important a record this is for Tesla, or any automaker for that matter, is certainly up for debate. In setting the initial record, Porsche was basically creating a new category in which to compete. As noted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s motorsports expert Sean O’Kane in 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CIasbI"&gt;Automakers love bragging rights, and the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife course is one of the prime battlegrounds. But over the years, the limits of the track have mostly been explored, and so there’s not as much rarefied air left for companies who want to claim they were the fastest around the 12.9-mile course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cwsFvx"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Tesla has set out to conquer the “Green Hell.” The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;run prototype versions&lt;/a&gt; of its Model S Plaid around the famous race track in the lead-up to its debut as a production model. Those runs weren’t attempts to break any records, though, as Musk has called them opportunities to “review and tune” the Model S Plaid for safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u4zw16"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eo9WVSNG3yI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRGt1d"&gt;The Model S Plaid is powered by a new tri-motor drivetrain that collectively put down around 1,000 horsepower, and the car can reach a top speed of 200 miles per hour — though only when outfitted with certain wheels and tires &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/10/tesla-warns-new-model-s-plaid-advertised-200-mph-tire-wheel-upgrade/"&gt;that won’t be available until later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEP2oA"&gt;But expert car reviewers are not convinced that the Plaid is worth its price tag of $130,000. After putting the new Model S through extensive tests, Edmunds concluded that it was just a “marketing exercise designed to draw attention to an aging car.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1IBap"&gt;The question is what will Porsche do now. The German automaker isn’t likely to sit back and allow Tesla to just steal its made-up record without some sort of response. The problem, of course, is that the Taycan just isn’t as quick as the Model S Plaid. Just look at the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;
