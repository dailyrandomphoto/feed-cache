    <title>NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter achieves historic powered flight on Mars</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dZYqV"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter nailed a successful debut test flight on Mars, engineers confirmed early Monday morning. The tiny spacecraft lifted itself 10 feet off the Martian surface for about 40 seconds, marking the first ever powered flight on another world. The historic demonstration opens up tantalizing possibilities for a new mode of planetary travel that could send future rotorcraft far beyond the reach of traditional rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Opmu"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity helicopter lifted its tissue box-sized body at noon Mars time (around 3:30AM ET), spinning its twin rotor blades to achieve its first flight in the ultra-thin atmosphere of Mars faster than 2,500 RPM — much faster than the roughly 500 RPM needed to fly on Earth. The rotorcraft arrived on the Red Planet on February 18th clinging to the underbelly of NASA’s Perseverance rover. It was deployed from Perseverance over a month later, on April 4th, starting a 31-day clock to carry out five flight tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EIwoXS"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory broke out in cheers upon confirmation that Ingenuity’s flight attempt was a success. “Confirmed that Ingenuity has performed its first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet,” downlink engineer Michael Starch declared. “We can now say that humans beings have flown a rotorcraft on another planet,” Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung told NASA engineers in mission control after confirmation of the helicopter’s successful flight test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vyg7DV"&gt;The flight was delayed a few times from April 11th, with one delay last week requiring engineers to re-upload Ingenuity’s entire flight software after running into a glitch during pre-flight tests. The helicopter has a running track-shaped flight zone at Mars’ Jezero crater, the site of a dried out lakebed that Perseverance will scour for signs of past microbial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOh6Mg"&gt;Ingenuity’s main mission is to demonstrate flight, with no objectives to explore Mars or carry out science experiments. Those jobs are reserved for Perseverance, whose primary life-hunting mission involves caching Martian soil samples that a future rover will send back to Earth as early as 2031. The rover was watching Ingenuity’s flight from a distance of roughly 330 feet away with two of its onboard cameras. Those images, scientists say, will arrive in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laYNL8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge is getting a performance mode to improve RAM, CPU, and battery usage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1SCbdG1Vo4W5W353-EGjZOmDAL0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148345/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PNiLU4"&gt;Microsoft is testing out a new performance mode for its Edge browser. The new mode is available to some testers using the Microsoft Edge Canary version of the browser, and others can enable it manually with a flag. “Performance mode helps you optimize speed, responsiveness, memory, CPU and battery usage,” &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/introducing-performance-mode-in-microsoft-edge-new-feature/m-p/2270856"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. “Performance improvements might vary depending on your individual specifications and browser habits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DiWHiB"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how the performance mode changes Edge, but it does affect the Sleeping Tabs feature. If you enable performance mode then the Sleeping Tabs timeout will be locked to five minutes. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242622/microsoft-edge-new-themes-icons-sleeping-tabs-feature"&gt;introduced sleeping tabs in Edge&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, allowing the browser to automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a number of tabs open, which helps new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlkSzm"&gt;Performance mode in Edge will likely prove most useful for laptop users, as browsers can often have a big impact on battery life. Google has also been working on improving Chrome performance and battery usage over the past six months. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;update in November&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved CPU usage, and an update earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326952/google-chrome-89-resource-efficiency-memory-hog-startup-speed-improvements"&gt;improved RAM and GPU usage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says no ‘Oculus Quest Pro’ this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h2DFbY"&gt;Andrew Bosworth, VP at Facebook’s Reality Labs, has given some more hints as to what’s in store for future Oculus hardware. In an audio Q&amp;amp;A with John Carmack on Twitter Spaces &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/facebook-oculus-quest-pro/"&gt;transcribed by &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bosworth suggested that while last year’s Quest 2 will be sticking around for some time yet, the company is working on headsets with greater capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAEIn3"&gt;“People are also asking about the Quest 3, which doesn’t exist yet, and [for] everyone who is listening to us who is a reporter — there isn’t a Quest 3, there’s only a Quest 2.” Bosworth said. “But I did hint at an &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-pro-facebook-bosworth/"&gt;AMA&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year about Quest Pro because we do have a lot of things in development where we want to introduce new functionality to the headset along the kinds that people theorize that we would want to introduce, and that’s a little ways off still. It’s still not gonna happen this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9KI16"&gt;“For those who are curious, Quest 2 is going to be in the market for a while — for a long while,” Bosworth continued. “And it’s going to be, you know, I think the best bet for the most accessible way to get into VR and have a great experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DX3zSs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HsYxmH"&gt;The discussion is particularly relevant right now because last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386496/resident-evil-4-vr-remake-oculus-quest-2-announced"&gt;Facebook announced the first title that’s exclusive to the Quest 2 headset — &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; won’t run on the original Quest. While the Quest 2 hardware is significantly more powerful than its predecessor, the announcement could have made owners of either headset wary about Facebook’s long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L7sQzi"&gt;Carmack, now a consulting technical officer at Facebook, said he was “supportive of Quest 2-only exclusives but believes there’s “still a pretty substantial market there in Quest 1 users.” Bosworth agreed, saying “I expect the incentives to be for developers to support Quest 1, absolutely. You are unlocking, you know, seven figures of additional users who could potentially buy your software — which is a pretty good deal when you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGHioH"&gt;“The formal answer is that we may eventually allow developers who have really high-end apps to target Quest 2 alone, but our very strong recommendation is to support both, and that’s actually what we expect to have happen based on historical norms,” Bosworth added, implying that the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; situation may not be all that common for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Audi teases the future of its electric sedans with the A6 E-Tron concept</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBWv1IegZJ4UCvqs7PRWGwH_Obo=/100x180:1984x1436/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69148007/XS21Outdoor52201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTE8rI"&gt;Audi has debuted a concept version of an all-electric A6 sedan, which is coming to all major global markets and will be built on a new EV platform the company is co-developing with Porsche. A production version won’t be revealed until at least the second half of 2022, but the German automaker is targeting around 700 kilometers (more than 400 miles) of range for the new car, which will be called the A6 E-Tron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWqNvt"&gt;The A6 E-Tron concept Audi showed off on Monday at Auto Shanghai 2021 is pretty straightforward as far as concepts go, which is in keeping with how the automaker has handled these reveals lately. To wit, the Q4 E-Tron electric SUV that Audi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382663/audi-q4-etron-sportback-electric-suv-volkswagen-price-specs-release-date"&gt;debuted just last week&lt;/a&gt; is a dead ringer for the “concept” version it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251528/audi-q4-etron-ev-concept-geneva-auto-show-2019"&gt;first showed off at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;. While there are plenty more details and specifics to be learned about the production A6 E-Tron — including price — what we’re seeing now will likely translate closely to what will eventually go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCjLFo"&gt;That includes not only a really healthy range target (thanks to a battery pack capacity of “around 100kWh,” according to Audi), but a fresh take on the A6’s sporty sedan look, as well as a bunch of high-tech upgrades, especially to Audi’s lighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j2kZdv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Audi is building its electric vehicles on many different platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjJGez"&gt;First, though, a note on that underlying EV platform. Audi and Porsche call it the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE. The two Volkswagen Group companies first started &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2020/04/02/audi-porsche-ppe-platform-electric-cars/"&gt;talking about it around a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s slated to power the larger vehicles in Audi’s and Porsche’s forthcoming electric stables. It’s at least the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; different EV platform Audi is building its electric cars on. Audi adapted one of its internal combustion platforms to include batteries and electric motors for the original E-Tron and E-Tron Sportback. Audi is using the Porsche Taycan’s J1 platform to power &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;the E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s building the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382663/audi-q4-etron-sportback-electric-suv-volkswagen-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Q4 E-Tron and Q4 Sportback E-Tron&lt;/a&gt; on Volkswagen’s modular MEB platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yfhsyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10453761"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gt1o1S"&gt;A lot of this ultimately won’t matter much to consumers, as it’s not like these Audi EVs will say “powered by Porsche” on the steering wheel or the exterior badging. But there are vast resources in the Volkswagen Group — especially as it tries to break Tesla’s early hold on the EV market — and Audi is clearly trying to leverage the best of what’s being developed across the larger conglomerate to make a big mark with its electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wp4wt1"&gt;That’s not to say Audi isn’t doing its own work. The company has spent years developing electric motor technology for its motorsports division (including fielding a team in the all-electric racing series Formula E). And in the A6 E-Tron concept, Audi says it’s even going to squeeze an extra few miles out of the PPE’s battery pack thanks to a special paint that can reflect “a significant percentage of the thermal radiation in sunlight,” meaning drivers will have to rely less on the air conditioning system, which can draw a significant amount of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YCPyu"&gt;And anyway, Audi’s cars and SUV’s are as much about the premium in-car experience as they are about what powers them. With that in mind, Audi is touting some notable upgrades to its already advanced lighting tech with the A6 E-Tron concept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rysiAL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An upgrade to Audi’s already advanced lighting systems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtaKnF"&gt;For one thing, the company says its so-called “Digital Matrix LED” headlights (which are only available outside the US) have gained new capabilities. These lights, which use a complex shutter system to sculpt the LED light into specific shapes and animations, can now project an Audi-developed video game on a nearby wall or garage door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2oyxu"&gt;Four LED projectors in the corners of the vehicle can create turn signal animations on the road. And three of them embedded in each side of the bodywork can do everything from present welcome messages on the ground for the driver and their passengers, to warn cyclists that a door is about to open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfQD18"&gt;Sedan sales have practically cratered in the US as buyers continue to be swayed by the high seating position and storage space of SUVs and trucks. Car companies — Audi included — are also incentivized to push consumers into these vehicles, which are typically profit centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJODiP"&gt;As high-end automakers push further into electric vehicles, though, they’re apparently willing to bet they can still make the case for these low-slung luxury vehicles, as Mercedes-Benz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385437/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-ev-photos-specs"&gt;just last week revealed what is essentially an all-electric S-Class sedan&lt;/a&gt;. The A6 E-Tron won’t be a pound-for-pound competitor to that offering, just like the gas-powered A6 doesn’t directly compete with the internal combustion S-Class. But the concept version announced Monday is a tease in two senses. One, it gives people a rough idea of what to expect from the ultimate production version of the A6 E-Tron. And two, it’s a first look at what Audi will do with the electric cars it’s building on that PPE platform — the same platform that will almost certainly power electric versions of other high-end A-series sedans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter, Facebook, and Snap are part of White House vaccination campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKb-MWIRmrMPFz7vukLtzpOT-Hk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69147042/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHzUjO"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, and Snap are among the companies that will assist with the Biden administration's promotional campaign for vaccine eligibility, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-vaccine-eligibility-push-e438587b-9b34-4b75-9132-7395c2768ed7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The White House had set a date of May 1st for states to open coronavirus vaccine eligibility to all adults, but later pushed it to April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGoEoE"&gt;The White House is hoping to reach populations who may have higher rates of vaccine hesitancy with the effort. Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, will do video clips on Snapchat, according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, and Facebook and Twitter will send out push alerts to notify users that they’re eligible to receive the vaccine. Vice President Kamala Harris will also be involved with the social media push.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAkKnu"&gt;Half of all US adults have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-pandemic-infectious-diseases-coronavirus-vaccine-6e3b18b44a05d1e49ed35337ec7ce969"&gt;received at least one COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), But the administration appears concerned that last week’s decision to pause the use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine may have made people already hesitant to receive a vaccine even more wary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYg4Q"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC recommended last week that the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pause the use&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine after six people who received the shot experienced unusual blood clots. The agencies wanted time to investigate whether there’s a connection between the clots and the vaccine. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/18/politics/fauci-jj-vaccine-friday/index.html"&gt;Fauci said on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that he believes the pause will be lifted by Friday, perhaps under some kind of restriction or warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2JL7h"&gt;“We can confirm that Snap has been in touch with the White House regarding efforts to spread awareness of vaccine eligibility among Snapchatters,” a spokesperson said in an email to The Verge, “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187176/snap-mental-health-coronavirus-anxiety-stress"&gt;building on our continued efforts&lt;/a&gt; to support our community during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The spokesperson did not elaborate on details of the efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKb9x8"&gt;Likewise, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed in an email to The Verge that the company was “working in partnership with the White House to elevate authoritative information in regard to COVID-19,” but did not share further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dduq6p"&gt;Facebook and the White House did not reply to requests for comment on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4fy0l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 18th 8:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comments from Twitter and Snap &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Live: NASA’s first flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icW-WuYceTNDBgSNe1fh5NCw75k=/0x61:1591x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146578/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0048_0671199786_638ECM_N0031708ZCAM05012_110085J.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter stands prepped and set for its debut flight on Mars. | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4dNJU"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter is slated to attempt the first-ever powered flight on another world at 3:30AM ET on Monday. The twin-blade rotorcraft will try to ascend 10 feet above ground and hover in place for 30 seconds while cameras on NASA’s Perseverance rover record the historic attempt from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLekK0"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity copter landed on Mars February 18th attached to the underbelly of Perseverance, NASA’s latest Mars rover whose main mission is to search for signs of ancient Martian life. Perseverance has set aside time to witness Ingenuity’s flight attempt and report the results back to Earth. Ingenuity’s Monday flight test is the first of five planned within a 31-day window that kicked off last week. If all goes well, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California will start planning for the next four, which could see the craft soar higher and travel farther, depending the results of its first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahAw1M"&gt;JPL engineers have sought to set expectations for the test flight during recent press conferences: “This is really hard,” said Elsa Jensen, an operations lead for one of the cameras aboard Perseverance that’ll be fixed on Ingenuity. Tests have gone well over the last week, Jansen added. “But we know there’ll be surprises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TmwxrF"&gt;How to watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5NV9qE"&gt;If the flight takes off as planned on Monday, NASA will have livestreams beginning around 6:15AM ET on Monday hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/891028594799991"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwQ9Sh"&gt;Because of the long data delay between Mars and Earth, we won’t see live video of the flight attempt — it will probably take a few days to get that footage. Instead, NASA’s livestreams will show engineers gradually analyzing data from Mars that will confirm whether or not Ingenuity survived its attempt. Did it fly as expected, or did it get swept away by a gust of wind? Did an alien steal it? We’ll know as soon as engineers find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIjXD4"&gt;Tune in early on Monday to see how the historic flight goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QXTFHC"&gt;What Happens Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fG3Q9o"&gt;Ingenuity’s power supply will be exhausted upon landing, so it needs to beam data to Perseverance in the most efficient way possible. That landing data dump will include a few low-resolution black-and-white images captured by its down-facing navigation camera under its tissue box-sized body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9Rx7C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is definitely a high-risk, high-reward experiment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbRE96"&gt;Sometime Monday, engineers will get other images captured by two cameras on Perseverance — Navcam and Mastcam-Z — with much higher resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrTfmX"&gt;The images from Ingenuity, along with troves of summary data, will radio signals to a so-called Mars Base Station situated on Perseverance’s body, which will relay those signals to a satellite orbiting Mars, which will then shoot the data through NASA’s Deep Space Network all the way back to Earth. Ingenuity will go into sleep mode and re-charge its batteries for the rest of the day using the small cutting board-sized solar panel above its little rotor wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLhBsT"&gt;On the next Mars day, or sol, engineers will wake Ingenuity back up and retrieve the first 13-megapixel color images taken by its other, horizon-facing camera. More flight data will be sent throughout the following day — “that’s kind of the prize of this project,” Tim Canham, Ingenuity’s operations lead, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U51c8e"&gt;“This is definitely a high-risk, high-reward experiment,” MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at NASA JPL, said Friday during a press conference. Based on several hours of tests, simulations and Martian weather analyses, Aung said “confidence is high” among the engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eZAetk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With just a little bit of swing, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; has moved its blades &amp;amp; spun to 50 rpm in preparation for first flight! Takeoff is slated for April 11, with confirmation expected overnight into April 12 for us Earthlings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE"&gt;https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EpDZymjP13"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EpDZymjP13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1380404668069650437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Gf5W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368208/nasa-helicopter-mars-perseverance-ingenuity-pre-flight-test"&gt;Ingenuity’s&lt;/a&gt; four-foot-long carbon fiber blades successfully unlocked last week after it planted its feet on the surface, and engineers were able to conduct a brief spin test at 50 rpm. For the craft’s actual flight, those blades will be spinning as quickly as 2,400 rpm — fast enough to achieve lift in Mars’ ultra-thin atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iFoDG"&gt;How Ingenuity does on its first flight test will determine the parameters of its upcoming flight tests. Aung said the helicopter’s “lifetime will be determined by how well it lands,” suggesting engineers could be able to carry out more flight tests within the 31-day window if things are successful. After that window, however, it’s likely Ingenuity will retire. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Army of the Dead, The Underground Railroad, Resident Evil, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QpZ-XEcuhDeJuLGskH1tty9pbIw=/200x0:1549x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146155/army_of_the_dead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Here come the zombies in &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1JGPhYBS8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XwaEA"&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;, and I won’t spoil the ending but if you’re thinking there will be a huge reveal at the end, well, you might be disappointed. What I found interesting throughout the four-part series was how the storyline relied on the voices of newspaper reporters who have covered the heist —and its aftermath —over the years. Considering the filmmakers are Colin and Nick Barnicle, sons of longtime &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; columnist and current MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle, it makes sense they’d center journalists in the story. Go watch it, Boston looks absolutely beautiful and the Boston accents are more authentic than anything else you’ll watch this year. Plus, if you can figure out the central mystery of the series there’s a $10 million reward in it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7yFtq"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers (which are heavier on the zombie content than usual): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wV3u5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI1JGPhYBS8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0sMBWf"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;We got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300924/army-of-the-dead-trailer-zack-snyder-netflix-vegas-heist-movie"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago but this is the first official full-length trailer for Zack Snyder’s big-budget heist flick. A group of mercenaries shoot their way into Las Vegas to get $200 million buried underneath the Sunset Strip before the government nukes the entire city. Plot twist: Vegas has been overrun by zombies— not the shambling, mindless creepers from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;, mind you; these zombies are organized and smart. And fast, like the &lt;em&gt;World War Z&lt;/em&gt; zombies.  (Side note: Kenny Rogers’ &lt;em&gt;The Gambler &lt;/em&gt;is the perfect music for this trailer: “you got to know when to hold ‘em/Know when to fold ‘em/Know when to walk away/ Know when to run.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvvKQs"&gt;Dave Bautista plays the zombie war hero who leads the ragtag group into battle. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ENAji"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Pq5Usc_JDA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bd2Vhw"&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XPW0zc"&gt;Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead, &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad &lt;/em&gt;is set in the novel’s alternate history, making the railroad of the title an actual 19th-century railroad that helps slaves escape the South. Thuso Mbedu plays Cora Randall, who is fleeing a Georgia plantation and being pursued by a bounty hunter (Joel Edgerton). Directed by Barry Jenkins, all episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad— &lt;/em&gt;a sure Emmy contender that looks hauntingly beautiful— will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on May 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XGYVK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KTnMDg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Di_PJyDGIg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T5PlKd"&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 9 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KHYtsf"&gt;This is one of many movies delayed by the coronavirus pandemic (the last trailer was in January 2020 and the movie was supposed to come out last May) but is finally back on the schedule with a new release date. Many familiar faces will return for &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, including (of course) Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, John Cena and Helen Mirren. The latest installment in the &lt;em&gt;Furious &lt;/em&gt;franchise hits theaters June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e469fM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mOAXaPVtD0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="58Rf7m"&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bPDZrN"&gt;Don’t you hate when zombies invade the White House and you have to go in and save the day? This teaser trailer gives some more clues into Netflix’s new anime series set two years after the events of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4. &lt;/em&gt;While an earlier teaser showed Claire walking around in what appeared to be a haunted house, this latest teaser shows that she and Leon are in the White House for separate reasons, and then: zombies.&lt;em&gt; Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness &lt;/em&gt;hits Netflix in July.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFKyOf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg6otB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two people killed in fiery Tesla crash with no one driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fpKWaJZoJGkEyXEGEnP19xLCRc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146086/fatal_crash_tesla.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2/status/1383787158297726985?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;KPRC2 Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOUhuo"&gt;Authorities in Texas say two people were killed when a Tesla with no one in the driver’s seat crashed into a tree and burst into flames, Houston television station &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/04/18/2-men-dead-after-fiery-tesla-crash-in-spring-officials-say/"&gt;KPRC 2 reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q5kIV"&gt;The cause of the crash, which happened at about 9PM local time in Spring, Texas (near Houston), is under investigation. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, first responders had to use 30,000 gallons of water over four hours to put out the fire, as the Tesla’s battery kept reigniting. Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0G6nVX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Two men dead after fiery crash in Tesla Model S.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“[Investigators] are 100-percent certain that no one was in the driver seat driving that vehicle at the time of impact,” Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said. “They are positive.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KHOU11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KHOU11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q57qfIXT4f"&gt;https://t.co/q57qfIXT4f&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eQMwpSMLt2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eQMwpSMLt2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Dougherty (@MattKHOU) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattKHOU/status/1383821809053683721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okQBN4"&gt;Preliminary reports suggest the car was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to make a turn, then drove off the road into a tree. One of the men killed was in the front passenger seat of the car, the other was in the back seat, according to KHOU. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told KPRC  that “no one was driving” the fully-electric 2019 Tesla at the time of the crash. It’s not yet clear whether the car had its Autopilot driver assist system activated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8fWBj"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment on Sunday. The company dissolved its press office and doesn’t usually respond to media inquiries, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3ZhXs"&gt;There have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;23 Autopilot related crashes&lt;/a&gt; under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but this appears to be the first fatal crash where there was no driver in the driver’s seat. Tesla has previously cautioned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. The company’s cars only check that attention with a sensor that measures torque in the steering wheel, though, leaving room for misuse — something the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;admonished Tesla for last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbIiEg"&gt;Tesla has previously provided &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/firstresponders"&gt;guidance for first responders&lt;/a&gt; who encounter fires involving its EV batteries. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;Reignition of the battery &lt;/a&gt;can be a problem, because unlike gas-powered vehicles, even if the fire is extinguished, an EV battery still has stored energy. Tesla’s guidance suggests it’s better to let the fire burn out than continuing to try to put it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMwP6Y"&gt;In the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17352814/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-face-tracking-gm"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has rejected&lt;/a&gt; calls from Tesla engineers to add better safety monitoring when a vehicle is in Autopilot, such as eye-tracking cameras or additional sensors on the steering wheel, saying the tech is “ineffective.” He said in 2018 that Tesla would regularly release safety data about its Autopilot feature, but added that “negative” press coverage about it might persuade customers not to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYqgFU"&gt;“When there is a serious accident it is almost always, in fact maybe always, the case that it is an experienced user, and the issue is more one of complacency,”&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings"&gt; Musk said on a May 2018 call with investors&lt;/a&gt;. “They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charles Geschke, co-founder of Adobe and co-inventor of the PDF, has died at 81</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vice President of Adobe Software" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cGKUeM-VojZv0XTgHUQ4Q9kp5wA=/0x490:3004x2493/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69145600/635239745.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VwiPcv"&gt;Charles “Chuck” Geschke, a co-founder of Adobe who helped develop the PDF, has died at age 81, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Co-Founder-Dr.-Geschke-Passes-at-81/default.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxfoFt"&gt;“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an email to Adobe employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBaB1"&gt;”As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate,” Narayen said. “Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OC2Doi"&gt;Geschke earned a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and then took a job at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center where he met Warnock. The pair left Xerox in 1982 and founded Adobe. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, the programming language that helped boost the desktop publishing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyfgWQ"&gt;Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to July 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in April 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Warnock from September 1997 to January 2017 and was a member of the board until April 2020, when became emeritus board member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="po4biz"&gt;“I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner,” Warnock said in a statement. “Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edmzlp"&gt;In addition to his contributions to the technology industry, Geschke was also known for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/8a22e47c0a3f078f7b1df0dda117d634"&gt;surviving a 1992 kidnapping attempt&lt;/a&gt;. Two men snatched him as he arrived at work one morning and held him for four days, demanding ransom. He was eventually rescued by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kF8f3"&gt;President Obama awarded Warnock and Geschke the &lt;a href="https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/charles-geschke/"&gt;National Medal of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVM5Iu"&gt;“He was a famous businessman, the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world, and of course he was very, very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life, but it wasn’t his focus — really, his family was,” his wife Nancy Geschke, 78, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/17/adobe-co-founder-charles-geschke-dies-at-81/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGPkik"&gt;Geschke is survived by his wife Nancy, who he was married to for 56 years, three children and seven grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl10U2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHEMKO"&gt;Federal officials are investigating a security breach at software auditing company Codecov, which apparently went undetected for months, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-investigators-probing-breach-san-francisco-code-testing-company-firm-2021-04-16/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.  Codecov’s platform is used to test software code for vulnerabilities, and its 29,000 clients include Atlassian, Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, GoDaddy, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpe8q3"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"&gt;statement on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, Codecov CEO Jerrod Engelberg acknowledged the breach and the federal investigation, saying someone had gained access to its Bash Uploader script and modified it without the company’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abORal"&gt;“Our investigation has determined that beginning January 31, 2021, there were periodic, unauthorized alterations of our Bash Uploader script by a third party, which enabled them to potentially export information stored in our users’ continuous integration (CI) environments,” Engelberg wrote. “This information was then sent to a third-party server outside of Codecov’s infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8zxiX"&gt;According to Engelberg’s post, the modified version of the tool could have affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z4l5g2"&gt;Any credentials, tokens, or keys that our customers were passing through their CI runner that would be accessible when the Bash Uploader script was executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OFJMsV"&gt;Any services, datastores, and application code that could be accessed with these credentials, tokens, or keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oydZff"&gt;The git remote information (URL of the origin repository) of repositories using the Bash Uploaders to upload coverage to Codecov in CI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="koXEdB"&gt;Although the breach occurred in January, it was not discovered until April 1st, when a customer noticed something was wrong with the tool. “Immediately upon becoming aware of the issue, Codecov secured and remediated the potentially affected script and began investigating the extent to which users may have been impacted,” Engelberg wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m8MWU"&gt;Codecov does not know who was responsible for the hack, but has hired a third-party forensics company to help it determine how users were affected, and reported the matter to law enforcement. The company emailed affected users, who Codecov did not name, to notify them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFx6J8"&gt;“We strongly recommend affected users immediately re-roll all of their credentials, tokens, or keys located in the environment variables in their CI processes that used one of Codecov’s Bash Uploaders,” Engelberg added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8osBIU"&gt;While the breadth of the Codecov breach remains unclear, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that it could potentially have a similar, far-reaching impact as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;SolarWinds hack of late last year&lt;/a&gt;. In that breach, hackers associated with the Russian government compromised SolarWinds’ monitoring and management software. Some 250 entities are believed to have been affected by the SolarWinds breach including Nvidia, Cisco, and Belkin. The US Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy, and Homeland Security agencies were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;
