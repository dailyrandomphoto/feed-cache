    <title>Apple teases major Music announcement as lossless streaming rumors mount</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/114Qih1BN4Gm7ubZptERHIF8OQU=/1x0:1111x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297485/msedge_ebejRVkHMS.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjXNwG"&gt;Apple is teasing a major Apple Music announcement. “Get ready,” a post in the service’s Browse tab reads, “music is about to change forever.” Tapping the image reveals an animated video, though it just consists of the music streaming service’s logo spinning in place. The teaser, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/apple-music-about-to-change-forever/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first reported by MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is believed to refer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Apple Music’s rumored lossless and hi-res music streaming&lt;/a&gt; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpuSpB"&gt;A launch of the new higher quality streaming is believed to be imminent after code referencing “Lossless” and “Hi Res Lossless” streaming tiers appeared in the service’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;web apps&lt;/a&gt;. According to code in the Android app, the lossless tier will support music streaming at 24-bit/48Hz (a small step up from regular CD-quality 16-bit/44.1kHz), while the hi-res lossless tier will stream at 24-bit/192 kHz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ScrJRu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/BEsuEUK7tr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BEsuEUK7tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1394046356868771844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlFqXh"&gt;Code in the Android app warns that these higher quality tiers will required more storage space and data to stream compared to existing quality. Apple Music’s current high quality tier consumes 6 MB of data for a 3-minute song, but this could rise to 36 MB with lossless, and 145 MB with hi-res lossless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFFxST"&gt;The benefit, of course, should be better sounding audio, similar to what’s already offered by the likes of Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and Deezer. Spotify has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;its own lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; which is due to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJTpjf"&gt;As well as lossless and hi-res streaming, code snippets also include mentions of “Dolby Audio” and “Dolby Atmos,” &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/16/lossless-audio-references-found-in-apple-music-web-app-as-company-teases-special-announcement/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The speculation is that the AirPods’ Spatial Audio features could be used in conjunction with Dolby’s surround sound technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAKwbk"&gt;Apple’s teaser doesn’t say when we should expect an official announcement, but some rumors suggest an announcement as early as Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdpd0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp’s new flagship phone has a giant 1-inch camera sensor and Leica branding</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tr6IWS0pnW4PQD5469hI0pVApoo=/0x0:2090x1393/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297483/sharp.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dP3AC6"&gt;It appears that Leica has found a new mobile camera partner, following Huawei’s sanctions-induced retreat from the international smartphone market. Sharp just announced the &lt;a href="https://jp.sharp/k-tai/aquos-r6/"&gt;Aquos R6&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, and its Leica-branded lens sits in front of what is now the largest camera sensor on any phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxTt8t"&gt;The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor is similar in specs to what you’d find in Sony’s high-end RX100 compact cameras. It’s only the second 1-inch sensor ever to make its way into a smartphone, and the first to make its way into a phone from an traditional phone manufacturer — Panasonic released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6151671/panasonic-leica-cm1-android-cameraphone"&gt;Android-powered CM1 back in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t exactly a mainstream device. The closest any current phone gets to a 1-inch sensor is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which has a 1/1.12-inch component behind the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="waAUWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only one rear camera, but it’s a big one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQ5jK0"&gt;The f/1.9 “Summicron” lens is also much wider than on other phones’ primary cameras, with an equivalent focal length of 19mm — that’s in ultrawide territory. Oddly, it’s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; outward-facing camera on the R6, so you’ll need to use digital zoom for more conventional focal lengths. The camera bump also houses an LED flash and a time-of-flight sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OGUE0"&gt;The Aquos R6’s other big feature is its display, which Sharp calls a Pro IGZO OLED. It’s a 6.6-inch 2,730 x 1,260 panel with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits and a variable refresh rate of 1 to 240Hz. Most Android phones to date haven’t been able to offer OLED displays with truly variable refresh rates that adapt to content in real time — this panel sounds like the most advanced available on any phone right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L183Uj"&gt;Elsewhere the R6’s specs are standard for a 2021 flagship: a Snapdragon 888, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It’ll go on sale in June in Japan through carriers NTT Docomo and SoftBank. Pricing isn’t yet available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy director’s Paralympics RPG is launching next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kVqUYWdXIIbeH2IwwvHMsjO8SQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297365/Rie_Ogura.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U9sddg"&gt;The first project from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt; director Hajime Tabata’s new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, the first game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307399/pegasus-dream-tour-paralympics-game-hajime-tabata-2020"&gt;initially announced&lt;/a&gt; more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’d been radio silence on the project ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOELvx"&gt;JP Games describes &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; as an “avatar RPG” set in Pegasus City. You can create a character based on a selfie from your phone, and train them in various para-sports. The game features illustrated versions of nine real-world para-athletes who compete in sports like javelin, athletics, and wheelchair basketball. Popular Japanese robot cat mascot Doraemon is also included as a guide to Pegasus City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bnldgiI3SheBdkRL0Rcz-HbVVY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519669/Rie_Ogura.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Badminton player Rie Ogura, who is featured in &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;. The athletes are illustrated by Japanese artist Godtail.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="egel4u"&gt;The teaser trailer doesn’t give too much information away about how &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will actually play, with very brief glimpses at the in-game action. The style and scope of the game appear to have changed quite a bit since its initial announcement, and Tabata suggests the Games’ delay altered the focus of the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oISx12"&gt;“The format of &lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt;, which was originally planned to be a “Para-Sports RPG” was switched to that of an “Avatar RPG” in the wake of the global pandemic and the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Games,” Tabata says in a statement. “This is because I felt that the Tokyo Paralympics, which would be held after the postponement, could allow humanity to overcome their divisions and help bring our spirits together. No matter what the outcome of the Tokyo 2020 Games is, it is my wish that people everywhere will come and receive the positive energy that is abundant inside Pegasus City.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86ux3cd0xlWhOn5KKD3VaV_OHZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519667/PEGASUS_SS_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G8EuoE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pegasus Dream Tour&lt;/em&gt; will be available for iOS and Android on June 24th. It’s a free download with in-app purchases; JP Games says some of the profits will go to the Agitos Foundation, an organization that helps people with disabilities get involved in sports. Pre-launch registration for the game will open today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft board members thought Gates should step down after affair with employee: WSJ</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bill Gates during 8th International Conference on Agriculture Statistics in New Delhi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5EEKWD5O-9QuOUrplRVrJ_NLLcw=/0x0:5440x3627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69297079/1183210456.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Indraneel Chowdhury/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s614Xu"&gt;Some of Microsoft’s board members concluded that Bill Gates should step down last year as an investigation was being conducted into an affair with an employee, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gates ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;resigned from the board in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says was before the investigation had been completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epJGgK"&gt;The board reportedly hired a law firm in 2019 to investigate the matter following a Microsoft employee alleging in a letter that she had had a sexual relationship with Gates over many years. The employee, who was an engineer at the company, is said to have asked that Melinda French Gates, who was married to Bill at the time, read her letter, though it’s unclear whether that actually happened. Gates and French Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418019/bill-melinda-gates-marriage-separation-charity-foundation"&gt;announced their separation&lt;/a&gt; this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZASch"&gt;“Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “A committee of the Board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N6vhd8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Board members ‘decided it was no longer suitable’ for Gates to remain a director&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QwQEz4"&gt;A spokesperson for Gates denies that his resignation from the board was related to the investigation. “There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” the spokesperson tells the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, adding that his “decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter. In fact, he had expressed an interest in spending more time on his philanthropy starting several years earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Md1ORp"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, some board members “decided it was no longer suitable” for Gates to remain a director at Microsoft as more information about the matter was revealed, and Gates stepped down before an official decision could be made. Microsoft had earlier that year pledged to improve the way it handled harassment complaints after several women &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295647/microsoft-workers-sexual-harassment-stories-internal-email-chain"&gt;shared dozens of their negative experiences at the company on an internal email chain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8XvEB"&gt;The board also reportedly inquired about Gates’ relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, but “were told the relationship was focused on philanthropy and nothing more.” A &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-gave-bill-gates-advice-on-how-to-end-toxic-marriage-sources-say"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, says Gates met Epstein dozens of times between 2011 and 2014, often seeking counsel about his marriage to French Gates. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that Gates said he was unhappy in his marriage while in Epstein’s presence “on at least one occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdYDfo"&gt;Gates’ association with Epstein was a source of concern for Melinda French Gates, who hired divorce lawyers soon after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/12/20911488/bill-gates-foundation-jeffrey-epstein-meetings"&gt;reports of the pair’s interactions&lt;/a&gt; became public, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. French Gates is also said to have been unhappy with how Gates handled a sexual harassment complaint against his money manager Michael Larson. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; reports that after the woman who made the claims agreed to a settlement, French Gates called for an independent review of the allegations and the culture at Gates’ investment company. Larson was put on leave but later returned to the job; it’s not known whether the report cleared him.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: The Green Knight, Wish Dragon, Venom 2, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CaSxAbVzJ3tblaIACu3K3GiUqeQ=/60x0:1469x939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69296162/dev_patel.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dev Patel stars as Sir Gawain in The Green Knight | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS6ksY8xWCY&amp;amp;ab_channel=A24" target="_blank"&gt;A24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4g5So"&gt;So since &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; isn’t dark enough (honestly give us &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, show writers), I also started watching &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; (HBO Max) and over the weekend watched &lt;em&gt;The Woman in the Window&lt;/em&gt; (fine, gritty anti-heroines are my thing, I guess). &lt;em&gt;Mare&lt;/em&gt; is so far reminding me a lot of &lt;em&gt;Broadchurch&lt;/em&gt;, another not-very-uplifting but great show, and Kate Winslet is going all-in on the accent and the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SRYGK"&gt;But wow what a disappointment&lt;em&gt; The Woman in the Window &lt;/em&gt;was. It has an all-star cast (Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Brian Tyree Henry, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Anthony Mackie) and a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, based on AJ Finn’s 2018 novel (which BY THE WAY, &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions"&gt;read the bonkers backstory&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy). It follows the mostly successful (but sort of irritating) trend of movies based on books about unreliable female narrators who get caught up in criminal activity (&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; The Girl on the Train). &lt;/em&gt;It even has the bones of the Hitchcock classic &lt;em&gt;Rear Window. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9c2waR"&gt;Maybe it’s just one of those books that doesn’t translate well to the screen, or maybe the &lt;a href="https://theplaylist.net/joe-wright-woman-in-the-window-reshoots-screenings-20210108/"&gt;reshoots&lt;/a&gt; undid too much, but the movie felt like it just couldn’t figure out what it wanted to be; a thriller, a mystery, a story about devastating loss, or something else. And why underuse that great supporting cast?! Unfortunately, I think it was too predictable, and not helped by weird pacing and a twist at the end that was more annoying than surprising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMkyli"&gt;On to this week’s trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FoXynG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS6ksY8xWCY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d21BFa"&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LOFoQw"&gt;Dev Patel stars as Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table from King Arthur lore.  The film is based on the &lt;a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight &lt;/em&gt;but the movie version looks a bit more sinister than I remember. What we see in the trailer hews pretty faithfully to the Middle English poem: The Green Knight challenges Gawain to strike him, provided Gawain will let the Green Knight strike him back in a year and a day. Gawain beheads the Green Knight, who picks up his head and saunters away. See you in a year, buddy! &lt;em&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; is in theaters July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xBH35Z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uWIRyU5fuzU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AEtx5x"&gt;Wish Dragon &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LnYemR"&gt;I needed something a little cute and funny because this week’s lineup seems kinda gruesome otherwise. &lt;em&gt;The Wish Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is an Aladdin-like tale of a magical being who can grant three wishes, but instead of being bound in a lamp, he’s trapped in a teapot. He’s freed by a young man named Din, who’s searching for his childhood friend Lina. John Cho, Constance Wu, and Jimmy Wong star in &lt;em&gt;The Wish Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, which was released in &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/netflix-wish-dragon-trailer-john-cho-constance-wu/"&gt;theaters in China&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, and will debut on Netflix June 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RLCNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zPlquR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ezfi6FQ8Ds?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DqueHh"&gt;Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4iOXBA"&gt;Tom Hardy returns as Eddie Brock and he seems to have come to an understanding of sorts with the Venom symbiote, who cooks him an absolutely disgusting-looking breakfast and has to be reminded not to eat people. This is another of the many films whose release was delayed by the pandemic. Venom 2 is slated to be in theaters September 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iXt8sS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOrXpK-rUaI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VIyJLY"&gt;The Forever Purge &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1EjWmL"&gt;At some point doesn’t the purge run out of people to purge if it is “forever”? It’s quite convenient that most of the baddies wear scary masks so you can easily identify them, I guess? This is the fifth &lt;em&gt;Purge&lt;/em&gt; film, and may be the final one (in which case the “forever” makes more sense). It picks up after &lt;em&gt;The Purge: Election Year&lt;/em&gt; and stars Ana de la Reguera, Josh Lucas, Tenoch Huerta, Leven Rambin, Will Patton, and Cassidy Freeman. &lt;em&gt;The Forever Purge&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters July 2nd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxH4ch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTuber Jake Paul being investigated for driving on protected Puerto Rico beach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jake Paul v Ben Askren - News Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0LjJVrI44ElJtf4P-T_i4btwDc=/0x579:2530x2266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295915/1309409409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xzuGg0"&gt;Officials in Puerto Rico are reportedly investigating an incident involving YouTube star Jake Paul, after he was seen in a now-deleted video riding in a vehicle on a beach that’s a nesting area for turtles this time of year, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/15/puerto-rico-investigating-jake-paul-after-viral-video-sparks-turtle-outrage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjg9S9"&gt;“I have ordered an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the use of two motor vehicles on beaches that are presented to be in Puerto Rico,” secretary of natural and environmental resources Rafael Marchargo said &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt; (h/t TMZ). “Some media have published today a video of the influencer Jake Paul in a motor vehicle on the beach, an activity that is prohibited, apart from law enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEPAKj"&gt;“Although the video does not establish where or when it was carried out, the DNER reminds citizens that this type of activity is prohibited by law to protect the environment and the species that can nest or live on the beaches. Those who violate the law face fines and other penalties, if applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nmp7yx"&gt;The back-and-forth between social media influencers seeking the perfect outdoor photo or video, and environmentalists who fret that the amount of attention isn’t good for the natural world has gone on for years. Some popular tourist spots have tried to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/travel/instagram-geotagging-environment.html"&gt;persuade influencers not to geotag their photos&lt;/a&gt;, lest followers try to recreate their shots and trample fragile ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2QfGd"&gt;That doesn’t appear to be the case with Paul in Puerto Rico; &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/05/15/jake-paul-puerto-rico-investigation-turtles-beach/"&gt;according to TMZ&lt;/a&gt;, Paul wasn’t aware of the nesting turtles and planned to cooperate with authorities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVLfcU"&gt;Paul and his brother Logan, who some media outlets reported may have been in one of the vehicles in the video, are well-known for performing rule-defying stunts in their videos; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841260/logan-paul-youtube-suicide-controversy-carelessness-online-celebrity"&gt;Logan was widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; and later apologized for, a video where he showed the body of a man who had died by suicide. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172657/jake-paul-bird-box-challenge-youtube-blindfold-netflix"&gt;Jake participated in the Bird Box challenge of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, walking around blindfolded for 24 hours while on video, which later prompted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/16/youtube-bans-dangerous-pranks-after-bird-box-challenge"&gt;YouTube to bar creators&lt;/a&gt; from showing “dangerous challenges and pranks” in their videos. And last year, police in Scottsdale, Arizona &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/04/jake-paul-youtube-riot-looting/"&gt;charged Jake Paul with criminal trespass&lt;/a&gt; and unlawful assembly when he was seen on video at a mall that was looted during a wave of protests over the death of George Floyd. Those charges were later dropped. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse expanding its new Android app to more countries this week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S2IDzm"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22424399/clubhouse-android-app-release-date-news-features"&gt;launching its Android app&lt;/a&gt; a week ago, social audio platform Clubhouse said Sunday it will roll out to more countries in the coming week. The Android app will be available in Brazil, Japan, and Russia on Tuesday, India and Nigeria by Friday, and the “rest of the world” throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLgOaW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Android rollout continues! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;        Japan, Brazil &amp;amp; Russia coming Tuesday&lt;br&gt;     Nigeria &amp;amp; India on Friday AM&lt;br&gt;  Rest of world throughout the week, and available worldwide by Friday afternoon&lt;/p&gt;— Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1393968237239545856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpc4Ow"&gt;For the first year, Clubhouse was only available on iOS devices. Despite its early limited access Clubhouse grew to 10 million users in its inaugural year, and was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-values-clubhouse-at-4-billionwith-dst-tiger?irclickid=30y0-83Z5xyLRMDwUx0Mo3EtUkBxIu02cSPvSM0&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;amp;utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&amp;amp;utm_term=theverge.com"&gt;valued at $4 billion&lt;/a&gt; after a new funding round. Whether it can keep up that momentum remains to be seen, as competitors— Twitter’s Spaces, Discord’s Stage Channels, and other better-known social media platforms—enter the audio market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzBIa8"&gt;Clubhouse remains invite-only and has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LiamODellUK/status/1393968691855953924?s=20"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; for not providing automatic captions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. The platform has lately focused on creators, and recently announced the results of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420644/clubhouse-creator-first-pilot-program-season-audio-social"&gt;an accelerator program&lt;/a&gt; which will fund 50 audio Clubhouse shows. CEO Paul Davison said during the weekly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CH_Townhall/status/1393977750361419782"&gt;Clubhouse town hall&lt;/a&gt; that next on the company’s roadmap are in-room tipping for creators, paid events, and subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is reportedly in talks to merge its media business with Discovery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEIbzCpdGrzvXV40hGeiICItzxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295421/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vlDm8s"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Discovery are in talks that would combine AT&amp;amp;T’s media business with Discovery’s reality-TV dynasty to create a massive new entertainment entity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/at-t-is-said-in-talks-to-combine-content-assets-with-discovery-kor6r2uj?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, citing sources. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-16/why-att-is-spinning-off-hbo-cnn-warner-media-discovery"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; corroborated the story&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “many Warner Media executives were stunned by the news.” Neither company confirmed the deal, but if it came to pass, the combined company would be a potentially significant competitor for streaming brands like Netflix and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gm5ih"&gt;But as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes, AT&amp;amp;T only recently added some major entertainment brands to its portfolio when it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-time-warner-m-a-at-t/att-closes-85-billion-deal-for-time-warner-idUSKBN1JA36U"&gt;acquired Time Warner for $85 billion&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that was finalized in 2018. And while AT&amp;amp;T’s streaming channel HBO Max has performed relatively well since its somewhat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21268490/hbo-max-launch-price-warnermedia-att-dc-harry-potter-friends-disney-netflix-peacock"&gt;messy launch last May&lt;/a&gt;, it’s still not quite as robust as older streamers like Netflix. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212963/new-discovery-plus-streaming-channel-roku-hbo-peacock"&gt;Discovery launched its own streaming platform&lt;/a&gt; Discovery Plus, which launched with shows spun off from its Discovery Channel catalog, including a new &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt; series and new series from the creators of &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUuVmy"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s WarnerMedia unit owns cable channels CNN, HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Discovery’s offerings include cable networks HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. But as more people migrate away from traditional cable TV and to streaming options, most media companies are trying to find new ways to reach audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODc2pC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s sources indicated a deal could be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ib44Au"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Sunday May 16th, 9:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of the LA Times’ corroborating report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon debuts free video-streaming service MiniTV in its India app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/daax4VVbei9pNl5bRSAQsR2MRj4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69295132/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H06VAa"&gt;Amazon has launched an ad-supported, free video streaming service called MiniTV within the Amazon India app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a different offering than its separate Amazon Prime Video service, as MiniTV is contained within Amazon’s traditional shopping app, rather than its own standalone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0VhbT"&gt;Only available to users in India, MiniTV’s catalog includes mostly older content which its content partners made originally for YouTube and other platforms. The lineup includes beauty and fashion content, tech news, and cooking shows, and Amazon’s partners for the channel include Indian web content studios Pocket Aces and TVF, and  list of well-known Indian comedians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyz1dN"&gt;The company says it’s planning “new and exclusive videos” in the coming months, but didn’t provide a timetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AsACx"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes, the channel should serve as a competitor to Flipkart Video, the free streaming service launched in 2019 by Walmart-owned Flipkart, one of Amazon’s biggest rivals in India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fu4oRr"&gt;Amazon is still marketing its Prime Video to consumers in India as it competes with Netflix, which has &lt;a href="https://qz.com/2002038/netflixs-big-plans-in-india-may-be-slowed-by-covid-and-censorship/"&gt;plans to launch&lt;/a&gt; more than three dozen new movies and shows in India this year. The free MiniTV will help Amazon test whether streaming content can drive sales on its shopping app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqiQVI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGKPHe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New leak ahead of Google I/O claims Android 12 may include changes for widgets and notifications </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kdTvT_cLRm-gr8gouPHYteBvyqY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69294807/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ClIYju"&gt;Just ahead of Google I/O, which gets underway on Tuesday, a new leak purporting to be a preview of what’s coming during the annual developers’ conference gives some insight into what Android 12 might look like. A new &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH"&gt;video from Jon Prosser&lt;/a&gt; shows what appear to be slides from a presentation of Android 12.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzHcVl"&gt;The first slide sets up what to expect: “A beautiful new experience,” “Stronger privacy and security protections,” and “All of your devices work better together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKLg96"&gt;The usual caveats about leaked materials apply, of course; there’s no guarantee this is what the final interface will look like, or how much may be announced during I/O. But the most interesting slide in Prosser’s video shows what appears to be a new user interface for Android 12, including a new media widget, a brightness toggle, a weather widget, an analog clock widget, a snooze/dismiss toggle, and stacked notifications (in the lower right corner of the screen grab):&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sD1Kno0uAE6ev-fPhH8zd-IBrdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22518083/prosser_slide_fpt_android_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYRd8v2eRAA&amp;amp;ab_channel=FRONTPAGETECH" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Prosser/Front Page Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A slide purporting to be part of a Google I/O presentation for new Android 12 features shows new UI elements.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gVbSuP"&gt;Previous leaks of Android 12 have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1362543670050881543"&gt;shown stacked widgets&lt;/a&gt;, which look similar to the Smart Stacks introduced in iOS 14. We’ve also seen earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;leaks via XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt; that showed new themes and a conversation widget for Android 12. And Google’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395383/android-12-developer-preview-3-haptics-camera-sensors-beta-release-date-features"&gt;previews&lt;/a&gt; of Android 12 have included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289976/android-12-developer-preview-roundup-notifications-redesign-tweaks-emergency-sos"&gt;a lot of small tweaks&lt;/a&gt; and developer-focused features, while hinting at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291296/android-12-developer-preview-ui-changes-widget-stacks-lock-screen-notifications"&gt;some significant UI changes&lt;/a&gt; that have been rumored, including the stacked widgets and a new lock screen with larger clock text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyVpS"&gt;Prosser shows a what he says is a video from I/O that shows updated notifications, a new keyboard design, and a new lock screen with a larger clock, which seem to confirm the earlier leaked info. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VZnjm"&gt;If the details in the latest leak roundup are accurate, Android 12 could be the biggest overhaul of the OS in several years. We’ll find out more in a few days when the annual I/O conference kicks off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uV5fg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
