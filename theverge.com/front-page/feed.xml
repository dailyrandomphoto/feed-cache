    <title>Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (2021) review: victory lap</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The newest Chromebook Spin 713 is just as good as last year’s model&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NeIr7b"&gt;Acer has made three significant upgrades to the best-in-class Chromebook Spin 713. The first is that the device now has Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. The second is that the USB-C ports both support Thunderbolt 4. And the third is that it now has an optional fingerprint reader (which isn’t available yet, but will be in the future). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxVBEo"&gt;These aren’t the most revolutionary spec bumps in the world. The rest of the Spin 713 remains the same: it has a fantastic 3:2 touch display, a good backlit keyboard, a smooth touchpad, and good value for its premium components. But the changes add up. And they serve to push the Spin 713 even further ahead of its competition than it was before. It’s very much still the Chromebook to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYt9Li"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10515970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QmmuFb"&gt;The Spin 713’s standout feature is its 2256 x 1504 panel. It’s one of the best Chromebook screens I’ve ever used. Colors really pop, details are crisp, and it gets plenty bright. Though the screen is glossy, I rarely saw glare, and what I did see didn’t hinder my work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2IL7D"&gt;But my favorite aspect of this display (and of this Chromebook as a whole) is the 3:2 aspect ratio. You get noticeably more vertical space than you would from a standard 16:9 display of a similar size. Less scrolling, less zooming out, more room for all your tabs and apps. I’m a fan of 3:2, and I’ve been happy to see more laptop models taking it up over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table angled to the right. The screen displays a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPGPEbVmpPQ9y9acEBBZGEtcTWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539425/mchin_20190815_4597_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screeeeeeeeen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ej4rpl"&gt;Another strength (which Acer has strengthened with this model) is the port selection. This is the first Chromebook to support Thunderbolt 4 — many premium Chromebooks don’t even support older Thunderbolt standards. There are not one, but two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left side of the Spin. This makes the Spin 713 one of the most affordable machines in the world to include Thunderbolt 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj9KqG"&gt;The USB-C ports also support USB 3.2 Gen 1, DisplayPort, and 5V charging. Elsewhere, you get an HDMI port and a microSD reader, in addition to a headphone jack and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1. The Spin also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 in tent mode, angled slightly to the left. The screen displays a grid of Android apps on a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKTBfTv9x3z97actsr6fcw_l9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539432/mchin_20190815_4597_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flip it around in tent or tablet mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n148ToMC64Cdahf_qAoWwuPQ3i4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539429/mchin_20190815_4597_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A, microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 half open seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqeBowf_w4ShwO3xZtZ4yfWmZww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539428/mchin_20190815_4597_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, an HDMI, and an audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WT2cqj"&gt;The fingerprint reader also helps put the Spin 713 above premium competitors; the lack of biometric authentication was one of our very few knocks against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;last model&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor lives on the deck, beneath the arrow keys. It’s the same color as the Spin’s finish and is nicely camouflaged. (While our review unit had a fingerprint reader, that unit is not available for purchase as of this writing, and does not have a finalized price. Acer says it’s coming “soon”. Currently, you can only purchase Spin 713 units without a fingerprint reader, but I’ll update this article when that changes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pUqFQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Fh6u"&gt;The Spin’s keyboard and touchpad are also quite good. The keyboard is comfortable and backlit, though I wish the keys didn’t feel quite so plasticky. The touchpad is smooth, accurate, and quite large.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR0Pbl"&gt;Like its predecessor, this Spin 713 has two main drawbacks. The first is that its audio is thin, and I heard a bit of distortion at maximum volume. The second is that the Spin’s aesthetic is utilitarian. The finish is somewhat drab, and the screen bezels are chunky. I wouldn’t call it ugly, but it’s something that would fit in on a school laptop cart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv7Fo6"&gt;That said, the Spin is also fairly sturdy, with an aluminum chassis, and feels better made than many plasticky devices you’ll find at this price point. The 360 hinge is easy to flip around, and I only saw a tiny bit of screen wobble while I was typing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table seen from the back, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUlNw1Z4uLk7bo8DZzVng0FPszc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539435/mchin_20190815_4597_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny bit of screen wobble, but I’ve seen much worse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open seen from the front. The screen dispalys a blue gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sG7NaRy6OP-4keVOTxJQ2YnRg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539424/mchin_20190815_4597_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is flipped around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m78SAc"&gt;Performance is the other area where the new Spin 713 is supposed to have gotten major upgrade. My review model is $699.99 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. This is the primary configuration that Acer will be selling to start, but more will be coming in August with pricing to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTXKWE"&gt;The Spin is the first Chromebook to be certified through Intel’s Evo program, which is meant to recognize the best portable Intel laptops on the market. The Spin did everything I needed it to, including editing big batches of photos and running multiple demanding apps at a time on top of Zoom calls and Spotify streams, quite fast and without any performance issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCul6z"&gt;That was also true of last year’s Spin 713. What’s new this year is that I’m hearing the fans. Last year’s model was very quiet, but the fans were almost constantly spinning in this model. The noise wasn’t always annoying, but it was often audible. This makes me anxious about the Spin 713’s ability to cool a Core i7, so even if Acer sells a Core i7 model later this year, I’d recommend that most people stick with a Core i5 model unless you know you need an i7. (The Core i5’s performance here is going to be enough for 90 percent of people.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIw31_xsHSOOhxm36KdS26bgk4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539434/mchin_20190815_4597_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t feel much heat in the keyboard, so the fans were doing their job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUmKAy"&gt;What’s also gotten a bit worse is battery life: I averaged seven hours and 29 minutes of consistent work with the screen at 50 percent brightness, running some trials with a bunch of Android apps and some trials just in Chrome. That’s about an hour worse than what I averaged on the previous model, though both results are respectable for this price. The battery took 55 minutes to juice from zero to 60 percent with light Chrome use, which is a bit slower than last year’s model (but close). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M6rdI"&gt;The Spin 713 runs Chrome OS, as all Chromebooks do. It supports all Android apps via Google Play. Everything ran smoothly on this system, in both clamshell and tablet modes. Many Chrome OS apps have improved since I used them on last year’s 713. Slack, for example, was crashing all over the place last year, and is technically usable now. That said, I still generally find that most of my preferred services (Messenger, Slack, Reddit, Instagram, the like) are equivalent or better experiences in browser form. I do like being able to offload distractions like Spotify and Twitter into their own apps so I don’t have them mixed in with my Chrome tabs, but that’s about as far as my typical use of Android apps on a Chromebook goes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right palm rest of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCEEfDcuPBYdqsyygiJbL8euOLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539431/mchin_20190815_4597_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could totally miss the fingerprint reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint on the Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0Zoir_fGe62UULibEolF_NxKZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539430/mchin_20190815_4597_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uKvCh0"&gt;As was the case with its predecessor, the Spin 713 isn’t a perfect Chromebook. It’s also not cheap as far as Chromebooks go. But it offered unbeatable value last year, and its value has gotten even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="t0LT9K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGwDNu"&gt;To illustrate just how much this device is offering for its $699 price, look to the premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. To buy a Pixelbook Go with an 8th Gen Core i5 (which is now an old chip), 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (half of what you get in this Spin configuration), you’d be paying &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/pixelbook_go?hl=en-US"&gt;$849&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixelbook does have some advantages over the Spin, of course: you’re getting better build quality, a lighter chassis, and slightly better audio. But the Pixelbook has no biometric authentication, it has very few ports and doesn’t support Thunderbolt 4, it’s 16:9, and it’s not a convertible. It’s miles behind in almost every other way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MWJtoI"&gt;In other words, if you don’t mind a laptop-cart look, the Chromebook Spin 713 is an incredible value. The more power-hungry processor has changed the calculus slightly, but so have the new features. And ultimately, the Spin still comes out on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLL2ec"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnTLel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 14th 5:38PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Acer confirmed after the original publication of this review that the Chromebook Spin 713 that’s currently available to purchase does not have a fingerprint scanner on it, even though our review sample does. A model with a fingerprint scanner is expected to come later this year, but the company has not finalized a price or release date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Turtle Beach is making dedicated flight sim hardware for PC and Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach VelocityFlight One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B3qi0f5R1SWbSJIM4OnzRZWQMgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451518/tb_velocityone_flight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, it costs nearly as much as a Series X, but look at it!&lt;/em&gt; | Turtle Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VQuya2"&gt;Gaming peripheral company Turtle Beach announced at E3 2021 that it’s getting into a new product category: flight sim hardware. The company is launching the VelocityOne Flight system for $350, and it’s compatible with PC and Xbox consoles via USB. And, for a first effort in this competitive space, it seems like a very comprehensive offering and a decent value if you’re into playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV2eqt"&gt;The VelocityOne Flight was made in collaboration with aeronautical engineers and pilots to provide a realistic flight experience. It has a 180-degree yoke handle with rear rudder controls for easy access. To its right, there’s a modular throttle quadrant with an integrated trim wheel, as well as both vernier-style and lever controls (with swappable tops for prop and jet planes). All in all, Turtle Beach says the VelocityOne Flight features 12 analog axes, two POV switches, two four-way HAT switches, and 18 extra buttons that can be mapped to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach VelocityFlight One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oj2u8CxqZwCsPi8Gzl2KadW7q9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657812/velocityflightone_screen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BRmCZz"&gt;In addition to controls, this hardware includes a 3.5mm jack on its left side for private listening. To deepen immersion (and to avoid having to push multiple buttons when you just want to fly and chill) the yoke has a display that can show stats like flight time, time at destination, and more. There’s a panel that can show other indicators, like real-time alerts, landing lights, landing gear, and more (though Turtle Beach says some of these features will be added later by software and firmware updates). This hardware doesn’t feature force feedback or rumble.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8U8944UrW87x8KiQjhaVnAKBIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657814/pov_hat_switches.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A zoomed-in look at the POV and HAT switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J58Hp7"&gt;CEO Juergen Stark said in a press release that this hardware “provides everything a new flier needs, along with the capability and features that hardcore flight simmers want.” In case you were curious, Turtle Beach says this hardware will work with other flight simulators — not just Microsoft’s latest one that’s available now on PC and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;coming later to console on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;. This hardware has a release window targeted for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach Recon controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz5RkceKzLXhDPe0_pO9Un7ChiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657785/tb_recon_controller.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dvfphu"&gt;The company is also releasing its first traditional controller for the Xbox Series X / S called the Recon Controller. It’s an intimidating-looking $60 wired model, and what makes it special is its audio chops. If you plug any set of headphones into its 3.5mm jack, you can turn on mic monitoring and swap through audio presets to modify how your game sounds. You’ll also have the option to use Turtle Beach’s Superhuman Hearing feature usually found in its own headsets, which amplifies easy-to-miss sounds that might give you the edge in a game. There are also buttons to adjust the game and chat audio mixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKcfYX"&gt;In addition, the sensitivity of the analog sticks can be tweaked and different profiles can be saved to one of the controller’s mappable quick-action buttons located on the rear. Its directional pad supports eight-way input, and its 10-foot braided cable is attached via USB-C to the controller. It’s also coming out sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After saving Tuca &amp; Bertie, Adult Swim has posted the first episode of season 2 on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym4e_UyC3fj0-yq9zOPLWMPLCqI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451428/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_12.48.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adult Swim&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gm76j9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie &lt;/em&gt;is back on the air thanks to Adult Swim, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIhZ0R2H7M"&gt;watch the entire first episode of season 2 for free&lt;/a&gt; on Adult Swim’s YouTube channel right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd86Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie&lt;/em&gt; is an animated show from &lt;em&gt;BoJack Horseman &lt;/em&gt;producer and artist Lisa Hanawalt starring Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong as two best friends navigating their adult lives. The show first premiered on Netflix in 2019 and debuted to rave reviews, but the streaming service canceled it after just one season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLomgV"&gt;In 2020, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267667/tuca-and-bertie-season-two-adult-swim-netflix-renewed-saved-bojack-horseman-lisa-hanawalt"&gt;Adult Swim picked up a 10-episode order of the show&lt;/a&gt;. The first episode of that new season premiered Sunday night, and if you missed the debut or just want to check out the show for yourself, you can catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X04lZa"&gt;If you watch this first episode and want to catch up on the series, you’ll have to subscribe to Netflix, as the first season is only available on the streaming service. New episodes air on Adult Swim on Sundays at 11:30PM ET / PT. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is banning alcohol, gambling, and politics from its ‘most prominent’ ad slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16VGS100QPvwsHwyHyNlRgnX-Cg=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451248/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.36.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the YouTube masthead ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oaWGXa"&gt;YouTube will &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10249050"&gt;no longer be accepting ads&lt;/a&gt; relating to alcohol, gambling, politics, or “prescription drug terms” for its masthead ad slot, which appears at the top of the website and app, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-masthead-advertising-ban-9b8d3f1c-f0e4-4520-bcad-fa2e1e46b1a5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the limitations on what kind of ads can appear in this slot will help “lead to a better experience for users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1drIW"&gt;The masthead slot is one of the first things users see when they open YouTube, so it’s understandable that keeping ads about drugs, alcohol, or gambling out of it would make YouTube more inclusive for everyone. As for politics, it could help the platform avoid controversies, like the one that arose when then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/youtube-will-end-full-day-masthead-reservations-like-trump-used.html"&gt;purchased the slot for three days&lt;/a&gt; during the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8W94yqS__A90P9oIPb3wH_UVeGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658293/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_11.23.48_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s new masthead requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RDZJbV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9709826"&gt;YouTube’s ad support page&lt;/a&gt;, ads in the masthead slot can “drive massive reach or awareness,” but now that megaphone will no longer be available to people wanting to advertise in certain spaces. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;already provides a way&lt;/a&gt; for users to limit the number of alcohol and gambling-related ads they see on YouTube, and in theory the setting would’ve applied to the masthead ad — according to Google, last year the company changed the slot to show targeted ads, rather than ones that had been reserved for an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2fQYZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/12/01/google-to-limit-some-drug-ads/070b7462-815d-47e1-9600-7af29ee871da/"&gt;For years&lt;/a&gt; Google has tried to balance its policies to determine what it does and doesn’t show in ads — recently, it’s reined in ads that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375702/google-updates-youtube-ad-targeting-hate-speech"&gt;used hate speech as keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21456323/google-election-ad-ban-donald-trump-early-victory"&gt;political misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328526/google-coronavirus-conspiracy-page-ad-ban-new-rule"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; around COVID-19. As it’s worked to clean up what ads it puts in front of users, Google’s ads business has also increasingly come under scrutiny from lawmakers who believe it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ripe for antitrust enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At $299, DJI’s leaked Mini SE might be its most affordable drone yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHbYUXc2ks17n0PqqfNgqzz5GeQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450874/dji_mini_se_upscale.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z7ffSb"&gt;We called the DJI Mini 2 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the best drone you can buy under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but what if you don’t have $449 to spend? Walmart has leaked a new entry in DJI’s Mavic Mini line that might start at just $299, which should make it the company’s most affordable drone ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBM3ZV"&gt;Not only did we just find that price &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDJI-Mini-SE%2F550297208&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s apparently migrated to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GAtamer/status/1403392256770445321"&gt;at least one set&lt;/a&gt; of Walmart store shelves already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qulh2J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/agxlPAF1Pb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/agxlPAF1Pb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Güçlü Atamer (@GAtamer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GAtamer/status/1403392256770445321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h7uihJ"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: as far as we can tell, this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; actually a less-expensive DJI Mini 2 — it appears to be a less-expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack"&gt;first-gen DJI Mavic Mini&lt;/a&gt;, a drone from 2019. As &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/06/03/dji-mini-se-shows-up-on-wal-mart-but-is-it-really-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, all the specs seem to line up with the original Mavic Mini, including its lower-res 2.7K-resolution camera (compare to 4K) and its inferior 2.5-mile wireless range, which strongly suggests the Mini SE doesn’t have Ocusync. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agXzeg"&gt;As Vjeran discusses in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our Mini 2 review&lt;/a&gt;, the Ocusync wireless link is perhaps the biggest reason to pick it over the Mavic Mini. It’s not just range: Ocusync is far more reliable and responsive, too. And though Walmart’s online images &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to suggest the DJI Mini SE might come with the Mini 2’s new-and-improved controller, the back of Walmart’s in-store reservation card makes it look like you’re still getting the original folding pad:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8iFakTe01wt8lbuYAH0Oak-Dsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658224/mini_se_back_card_reddit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/ns235y/what_the_link_in_first_comment/" target="_blank"&gt;u/Mr_DMoody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can make out a tiny image of the old folding controller at lower left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHZH2A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/ns235y/what_the_link_in_first_comment/h0mc6tp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;As internet sleuths are pointing out&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like the primary differences here are simply a $100 lower price and a slightly improved plastic chassis, which may or may not make it compatible with the Mini 2’s batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GltUl"&gt;Bargain hunters will know that $299 isn’t completely unheard of for a DJI drone — I’ve seen refurbished and closeout Phantom 3 Standard kits for $299, and I believe there was a one-time $299 deal on the Mavic Mini. But if the DJI Mini SE actually retails for $299, that’d be a deal right out of the gate. It’d be extremely tempting to would-be drone buyers looking for something they can easily stuff in a bag and (at sub-249g) one they won’t need to register with the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhVsu9"&gt;It’s not clear when the Mini SE might go on sale. DJI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything we know about Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iD1UgiaImJ8gb9ulk_fXtCx5p-I=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450387/HaloInfinite_613_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bnoYCU"&gt;343 Industries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531861/halo-infinite-e3-2021-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;gave us a first glimpse at Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode yesterday, and now we’re getting even more information on how the weapons, armor, and sandbox experience will work. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is launching on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC later this year, allowing friends to play the free multiplayer mode across multiple platforms using crossplay and cross-progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VTOIE"&gt;The free multiplayer mode will also include a battle pass that never expires after you’ve purchased it. We don’t know how much the battle pass will cost yet, but &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;players will be able to purchase old season passes and choose which battle pass to focus progression toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXAAVP"&gt;343 Industries is leaning heavily into armor, weapon, and vehicle customizations, without random loot or loot boxes. The battle pass will provide armor and presumably more, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; players will also be able to play to earn customizations that even include customizing a character’s voice or adding prosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gc2DyfEH7q65-PnWN5EQEtjHAiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657838/yN0PNvJ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 343 Industries&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armor customizations in Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="80Ozhi"&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YNg1vk"&gt;“There will be millions of customization combinations for Spartans on the battlefield,” explains Ryan Paradis, a live design director at 343 Industries. Armor customizations will include different coatings, emblems, effects, and all the typical armor pieces like your shoulders, gloves, kneepads, helmet, and visor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVE7E0"&gt;Weapons will also include a variety of customizations, and even vehicles will get customization options, too. Players will be able to customize each item in-game or through the Halo Waypoint website and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBb8t"&gt;A lot of customizations are unlocked through playing the game, and only through playing. All of the customizations are purely cosmetic, and each season will introduce new looks that players can collect. 343 Industries hasn’t revealed whether different sets of armor will have different sets of power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0vW4xBEfm9HT4RXp2xmuKHnvFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657860/grapplehook.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s grappling hook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hQBidm"&gt;Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kKuCsY"&gt;Classic &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;weapons are returning, including an assault rifle, battle rifle, gravity hammer, needler, plasma pistol, and even sticky plasma grenades. There will be a variety of heavy weapons, with one demonstrated in the trailer that can take out vehicles. Dual-wielding won’t be supported at launch, but 343 Industries &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/halo-infinite-wont-have-dual-wielding-at-launch/"&gt;isn’t ruling it out entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJBIcX"&gt;343 Industries revealed how combat works in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Equipment is returning with &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and you can use the new grappling hook for tactical play and combine it with other equipment to complete objectives. The grappling hook can also be used for mobility to move quickly around a map or to grab weapons and throwable objects. Other players can also pick up items like your overshield during play, and even choose when to use them instead of instant activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y3JRdu"&gt;Vehicles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Mvwi"&gt;Vehicles are a big part of the battle arena in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. A new Razorback vehicle can carry additional weapons at the rear, and it’s designed to be a cousin of the classic Warthog. The Warthog will be available in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s part of a number of vehicles that will be delivered by Pelicans instead of spawning at bases. Weapon pods, like the &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt; days, will also drop during combat for resupplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIKS6a"&gt;Using a vehicle will come at a risk, though. A Warthog’s wheels can be blown off from damage, and vehicles catch fire after a certain damage threshold. That means you have to choose when to ditch a vehicle wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puxfN6YOW6243iWtMWLW0AYRqYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657855/vehicleshaloinfinite.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vehicles in Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RVnyLT"&gt;Academy and training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QjwFua"&gt;If you’re new to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, there’s even an academy mode to let people get used to the look, feel, and terminology of the game. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is using bots in a separate training and tutorial area, with a variety of difficulty levels so they can also be used as training partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkVxDr"&gt;This area is a separate map to the environments we’ve seen in the trailers. It’s not clear how many maps will be available in Halo Infinite yet, but we’ve seen both outdoor and indoor maps that offer the variety of close combat or distance and vehicle usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxB6Z"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is launching simultaneously on PC and Xbox, crossplay and cross-progression will be included at launch. On Xbox Series X, the arena mode will support up to 120fps, and on the PC side there will be support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1e6Vj"&gt;343 Industries hasn’t provided a deep dive on how it plans to balance crossplay controller vs. mouse and keyboard, but there will be input-based matchmaking for the ranked parts of the game. The studio has also &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-april-2021"&gt;committed to a server-side anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt;, which includes spotting hackers based on their behavior in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxTBgh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launches in the fall on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC. A “technical preview” will be available later this summer, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/halo-insider"&gt;sign up at the Halo Waypoint site&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to get access.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reality Winner has been released from prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Press conference of Reality Leigh Winner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BqI02tkFUfHrtqPvSsNNlhkCzEc=/0x283:4611x3357/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450327/694744988.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHXrra"&gt;Reality Winner, a former intelligence contractor jailed for leaking classified information, has been released from prison to serve her remaining sentence in a halfway house program. Winner’s attorney Alison Grinter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alisongrinter/status/1404457754962636804"&gt;tweeted the news&lt;/a&gt; this morning, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ website lists Winner in custody of San Antonio’s Residential Reentry Management field office, which oversees community-based programs for incarcerated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KPSRQ"&gt;“I am thrilled to announce that Reality Winner has been released from prison. She is still in custody in the residential reentry process, but we are relieved and hopeful,” Grinter tweeted in a statement. “Reality and her family have asked for privacy during the transition process as they work to heal the trauma of incarceration and build back the years lost. Her release is not a product of the pardon or compassionate release process, but rather the time earned from exemplary behavior while incarcerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdfpge"&gt;Grinter said Winner is still barred from public statements or appearances, and the BOP’s website still lists her release date as November 23rd, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SSvotD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some very exciting news for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RealityWinner?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RealityWinner&lt;/a&gt; and her family!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/yjZf7xiitk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yjZf7xiitk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alison Grinter Allen (@alisongrinter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alisongrinter/status/1404457754962636804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jrvibF"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Grinter wrote that Winner would continue to seek a pardon. “The Residential Reentry center is in charge right now and will manage her transition, but we are definitely still seeking commutation and pardon,” she said. “The fight continues and I’ll still be taking meetings in Washington to press forward the case for commutation and pardon, but the family will be stepping back to concentrate on Reality and her health and healing. She became an aunt while she was behind bars, and she is going to spend as much time as she can bonding and tickling little feet as she adjusts to life in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VP2v7c"&gt;Winner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17503656/reality-winner-guilty-plea-agreement-prison-time"&gt;pleaded guilty to espionage&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, one year &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-contractor-georgia-charged-removing-and-mailing-classified-materials-news"&gt;after being arrested&lt;/a&gt; for leaking a National Security Agency report on US election security. The report &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/"&gt;detailed Russian attempts&lt;/a&gt; to hack US voting systems before the 2016 election, an issue then-President Donald Trump had downplayed in the following months. (It did not indicate whether the cyberattack had any concrete effect on the election.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMonjW"&gt;Federal law enforcement determined that Winner had printed the report and mailed it to &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and her plea deal included a five-year prison sentence under the Espionage Act — a law that’s difficult to mount a defense against, since defendants effectively can’t argue that they disclosed information in the public interest. Both the Trump and Obama administrations have leveraged the Espionage Act against whistleblowers, including Chelsea Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison before &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/17/528731790/after-serving-7-years-of-a-35-year-sentence-chelsea-manning-to-walk-free"&gt;having her sentence commuted&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys39rc"&gt;Winner unsuccessfully sought a release from prison during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, and she tested positive for COVID-19 in July 2020. A &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/united-states-vs-reality-winner-review-1234932409/"&gt;documentary about her case&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;United States vs. Reality Winner&lt;/em&gt;, premiered at the SXSW film festival this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus launches $499.99 Chromebook Flip CM5 with AMD Ryzen 5 processors </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pXCU8DiBe2p8JNXPZrhuPwXfRSs=/0x71:813x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450240/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHNaXA"&gt;Asus has released its latest Ryzen-powered Chromebook, the Chromebook Flip CM5. The CM5 has a 15.6-inch screen, and Asus is pushing it as a device for cloud-based gaming. It’s available now at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abt.com%2FAsus-Chromebook-Mineral-Gray-15.6-AMD-xA0-Ryzen-xA0-3-xA0-3250U-xA0-Processor-4GB-RAM-64GB-eMMC-AMD-Radeon-Graphics-CM5500FDADS344T%2Fp%2F162596.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F14%2F22533361%2Fasus-chromebook-flip-cm5-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeAsusChromebookFlipCM5061421&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-cm5500fda-ds344t%2Fp%2FN82E16834235776" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt; starting at $499.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNFG9B"&gt;The most exciting thing is that the CM5 supports both Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now. Of course, it only has a 60Hz screen and Radeon integrated graphics, so it’s far from a “gaming laptop” of any sort. Still, Asus has made a few design tweaks to better evoke the aesthetic. Namely, the WASD keys are outlined in orange, which Asus says “lets users stand out while enjoying quick, intuitive gameplay in cloud-based games.” Some Windows laptops have done bold things with their WASD keys, but this is the first Chromebook we’ve seen with that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBhpnP"&gt;Asus also emphasized the Harmon Kardon-certified audio system and Wi-Fi stabilizer technology, which should likely help create a more immersive gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzdDM1tmb6oEGmtD37ghuqGWCyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657876/34_235_776_V22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Newegg&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="czLXPg"&gt;The CM5 has a 57Wh battery, which Asus claims offers up to 10 hours of battery life. You can configure the device with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage as well. You can choose a Ryzen 5 3500C or a Ryzen 3 3250C, both of which come with AMD Radeon integrated graphics. The chassis itself is made of an aluminum alloy, which Asus describes as “mineral gray” with an “obsidian velvet” texture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcXrOD"&gt;I’ll keep you posted on how this device performs once I’ve gotten my hands on a unit. In the meantime, I recently reviewed its sibling, the Chromebook Detachable CM3, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell XPS 13 OLED review: more pixels, more money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED open on a table. The screen displays a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsiB3M7WzHEs8SHxacpdDnxP8uc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449719/mchin_20190905_4631_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Dell XPS 13 OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CN1B9P"&gt;If you’ve been waiting for a 13-inch laptop with the best display technology out there, Dell now has an option for you. Dell has finally released an &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDellXPS13OLEDReview061121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto235h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OLED version of its XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m typing this review on it right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7d1kN"&gt;The test unit I was sent has a Core i7-1185G7, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. The OLED configuration costs exactly the same as an identically specced non-OLED 4K model ($1,699.99), and $300 more than an identically specced FHD touchscreen model. Nothing else about this XPS is new: it has the same thin and light build, the same tiny bezels and webcam, the same glass-fiber palm rests, and the same 16:10 aspect ratio as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;past couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13s&lt;/a&gt; I’ve reviewed. So the considerations here really come down to how much you need an OLED screen and what you’re willing to sacrifice for it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="m94km9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dell XPS 13 (late-2020) review: greatness, refined","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"},{"title":"Best laptop 2021: 15 best laptops you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4OcF4ImdiKj6q7kChY6-3Kif2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653795/mchin_20190905_4631_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks just like the previous XPS 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RVuPNN"&gt;The display itself is great. It’s a 3.5K (3456 x 2160) panel with a claimed 100,000:1 contrast ratio. It maxed out our colorimeter, covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It’s not as bright as the FHD model but is still plenty bright, maxing out at 369 nits. I had no problem using the device outside and was usually using it below 30 percent brightness while indoors. Numbers aside, it delivers a really gorgeous picture with bright and vibrant colors and sharp details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I03TfK"&gt;The downside, of course, is that there is some battery life impact. I haven’t reviewed the 4K Dell XPS 13, so I can’t speak to that unit’s longevity. But compared to the FHD model I reviewed, the OLED model struggles on the battery life front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED closed seen from the left side on a wooden table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NU9n_cQXEdnfVi_xRWOvCtjGnHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653796/mchin_20190905_4631_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not too many ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="imSQve"&gt;Battery life, for context, has been a huge selling point of other XPS 13 models. I averaged nine hours and 15 minutes using the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDellXPS13OLEDReview061121&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fnew-xps-13-touch-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-9310-laptop%2Fxn9310cto230h%3Fconfigurationid%3D7d01f270-b71e-4488-a6e9-56ab3a967927" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FHD model&lt;/a&gt; as my primary work driver around 200 nits of brightness. With the OLED model, I was getting about five hours from the same workload at the same brightness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vJCWF"&gt;That’s... well, that’s a big gap. And it should be a serious consideration if you’re thinking of purchasing this device. After all, the FHD display is still pretty darn good. The blacks on my review unit weren’t as deep as they were on this OLED panel, but the picture it delivered was still fantastic and not something my un-artistic eyes had any problems with. (On the other hand, the non-OLED 4K display also doesn’t seem to have great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2020"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-model-9310-4k"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-XPS-13-9300-4K-UHD-Laptop-Review-16-10-is-the-New-16-9.464337.0.html"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;. So the OLED is more competitive with that model, especially since it’s the same price.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Intel Evo sticker on the bottom right corner of the Dell XPS 13 OLED." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pV_lRH5nBqf-s_oJRzfriPIvb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653797/mchin_20190905_4631_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Evo-certified, despite the battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cXIOBO"&gt;For that reason, I would still recommend that most people go for the FHD XPS 13 over the OLED model. Five hours is not great battery life, but it’s especially not great for an ultraportable laptop this close to the $2,000 mark. It’s certainly a dealbreaker for me, even if everything else about a laptop is perfect. It means I’d have to have this thing plugged in multiple times a day, even though one of its primary benefits is supposed to be that it’s light enough to carry around wherever. I want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpazZ4"&gt;Meanwhile, as nice as the OLED screen is, I can’t imagine it’ll make a huge quality-of-life difference to all but the most discerning of viewers. It certainly shouldn’t be a big enough difference to outweigh a $300 premium and a four-hour hit to battery life. If you’re someone for whom the OLED is worth the price, you probably know who you are. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 OLED lid on a wooden table seen from the top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dURjdBErq8wET1b1gVuT4iDFsec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653798/mchin_20190905_4631_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy it for $1,699.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="NPjFM7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606062"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Beats announces $149.99 Studio Buds earbuds with active noise cancellation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgCrrFNMKZpmYLR95-kVeol0Sss=/0x0:1665x1110/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69449666/3FAM_COMP_KV_WhiteBG_RGB_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mu6IjI"&gt;Beats today announced its second pair of true wireless earbuds, the new Beats Studio Buds.  Priced at $149.99 and available in red, black, or white, the Studio Buds have a much different, more compact design than the previous Powerbeats Pro. There are no ear hooks on these, nor any stems, and that results in a very lightweight, comfortable fit. Preorders start today in the US and Canada from Apple and other retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B096SSCV5K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-buds-totally-wireless-noise-cancelling-earphones-beats-red%2F4900921.p%3FskuId%3D4900921&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and the earbuds will be available in stores on June 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7Lt2e"&gt;The Studio Buds include active noise cancellation, IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and can last for up to five hours on a charge. (If you leave noise cancellation off, they can eke out eight hours of continuous playback. They also use USB-C for charging — there’s no wireless charging, unfortunately — and either earbud can be used independently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDwELo9-MOlt2IXkYhsfvqgJWvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657571/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_10.13.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beats&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Studio Buds have a sleek, lightweight design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8qH2S"&gt;Interestingly, Beats is supporting both iOS and Android features with the Studio Buds. On iPhone, you get the familiar, easy AirPods-like setup and Control Center integration. They can also do hands-free “Hey Siri” commands. On Android, Beats now works with Fast Pair and Google’s Find My Device features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HlBrz"&gt;Beats came up with an all-new acoustic architecture design for the Studio Buds, which have  8.2-millimeter drivers, and the company claims you can expect “outstanding stereo separation and low harmonic distortion across the frequency curve so you hear every note.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loR4Kw"&gt;If you’re wondering how the Studio Buds might stack up to the AirPods Pro or other competitors, I’ve been spending some time testing the just-announced earbuds, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22297011"&gt;read my full review of the Beats Studio Buds here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
