    <title>Rising temperatures are causing an unprecedented transformation in the Arctic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Arctic sea ice loss graph NSIDC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5f9CZyy3hPp_UXOolfiDlAaDcg=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273792/NOAA-sea-ice-loss.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b6JrWF"&gt;Climate change continues to create “cascading disruptions” in the Arctic as the region experiences rapid warming, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) writes in its 16th annual &lt;a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/Portals/7/ArcticReportCard/Documents/ArcticReportCard_full_report2021.pdf"&gt;Arctic Report Card&lt;/a&gt; released earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvqOwX"&gt;Pulling together the most recent data on temperature trends, sea ice cover, and more gathered in 2020 and 2021, this year’s Arctic Report Card includes 111 contributing writers from 12 countries, who detail the transformation taking place across the far north as a result of human-caused climate change. That includes dramatic sea ice losses, rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and exceptionally warm autumns. The Arctic experienced its warmest autumn on record between October and December 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TkQxz"&gt;None of these observations are terribly surprising at this point — the Arctic is one of the fastest-warming regions on the planet, and scientists at NOAA and elsewhere have been documenting a cascade of impacts for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRw85m"&gt;“The trends are consistent, alarming, and undeniable,” NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said at a press conference at the American Geophysical Union today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fECF9"&gt;Twila Moon, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center who edited the report, noted that a series of “extreme events” brought “unprecedented conditions” to the Greenland ice sheet, which experienced three separate ice melts during the summer of 2021 for just the second time on record, Moon said. This year, Greenland also experienced rain in its summit for the first time in August. This sort of event has the potential to make the ice sheet more vulnerable to melt in the future, Moon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0XzdL"&gt;In addition to melting ice on the land and at sea, the report highlights how rising temperatures are shifting the ecosystems of the Arctic. One species in particular gets spotlit in the new report: beavers. According to NOAA, these ecological engineers are rapidly colonizing the warming Alaskan tundra, modifying the landscapes as they go by creating ponds that can affect the underlying permafrost soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzIAY0"&gt;Populations in the Arctic region have made efforts to adapt to the changing conditions, but the Arctic’s rapid evolution calls for more attention from those who reside there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XOjPZb"&gt;“Our people live in these extremely variable conditions for thousands of years, and we’re very worried about the changes highlighted today,” Kaare Sikuaq Erickson, a science liaison from the Bering Sea village of Unalakleet, Alaska, said at the press conference. “It’s really tough for us to live up there, let alone thrive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vfEwdI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Arctic is the Earth’s air conditioner.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dNEHeF"&gt;Experts who spoke at the press conference emphasized that what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay there and that the changes will continue to intensify unless humanity takes more aggressive action on climate change. According to NOAA, since the mid-1960s, the Arctic has seen nearly 3 degrees Celsius of warming — far more than the global average rise of &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_FAQ_Low_Res.pdf"&gt;just over a degree Celsius&lt;/a&gt; since the late 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYLW7x"&gt;“The Arctic is the Earth’s air conditioner,” Spinrad said. “Billions of people rely on its moderating influence on climate. We have a narrow window of time to avoid very costly, deadly, irreversible future climate impacts.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram reportedly hit 2 billion active users but probably won’t admit it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sx95UwQDpahLqchViGmEMGadWxE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273742/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J0lDrp"&gt;Instagram has reportedly climbed to 2 billion monthly active users, that is according to anonymous employees who broke the news to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/instagram-surpasses-2-billion-monthly-users.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Meta-owned company hasn’t — and probably won’t — officially disclosed these numbers, as it has spent the last several months under scrutiny for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22816730/mosseri-testimony-instagram-senate-hearing-haugen-child-safety-facebook-meta"&gt;potentially causing harm to kids and teens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ALQdk3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The last time Instagram publicly announced the size of its userbase was back in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4FhsOi"&gt;The last time Instagram publicly announced the size of its userbase was back in 2018 when the platform revealed that it had 1 billion users. It took three years for Instagram to hit the 2 billion mark. The employees who tipped off &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; say that they found out about the number during internal conversations — one staff member reportedly told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; that Instagram surpassed the threshold around a week before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Facebook’s decision to change its name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nkpn7"&gt;Instagram has been desperately trying to stay ahead of TikTok, the fast-growing short-form video app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users"&gt;just crossed 1 billion users in September&lt;/a&gt; — just three years after the app merged with Musical.ly and became widely available. While Instagram is still outpacing the platform, for now, it’s unclear how long that will last. Instagram has been rolling out feature after feature that just seems like a TikTok knockoff, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832529/instagram-reels-visual-replies-feature-tiktok-copy"&gt;newly released Reels Visual Reply&lt;/a&gt; is just the latest example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPcjeE"&gt;That said, Instagram isn’t really in the position to brag about its userbase right now, since its own internal study found that the platform may &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;exacerbate body image issues in young girls&lt;/a&gt; and has also been accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822584/instagram-teen-users-drugs-hashtags"&gt;making it easier for teens to find drugs&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to counteract these issues, the platform has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;rolled out a “take a break feature,”&lt;/a&gt; which prompts users to close the app if they’ve been on it for a set period of time, and also announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22821955/instagram-parental-controls-teenage-safety-features-take-a-break-nudge"&gt;introducing new parental controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk15Qn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Instagram with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s not-Chromecast Google TV dongle adds an ethernet jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ALQF0b48xhB7FxbBoVrATC1QY_Q=/0x0:2058x1372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273722/tvision_hub.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TVision Hub offers 4K streaming and ships with a voice-control remote&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: T-Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gk6wc5"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;TVision streaming service was not long for this world&lt;/a&gt;, but its name lives on in the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F14%2F22834584%2Ft-mobile-tvision-hub-google-tv-chromecast-dongle-ethernet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub&lt;/a&gt; — a $50 dongle with Google TV. It appears to function a lot like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s own Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, but along with some T-Mobile branding, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/14/tmobile-google-tv-ethernet-dongle/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; that it offers a feature you won’t find on Google’s streaming dongle: an ethernet jack. That direct internet connection may be a real benefit if your home Wi-Fi signal isn’t quite up to the task of streaming 4K video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="38xndx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2021/12/t-mobile-releases-new-tvision-hub-for-some-reason/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the device last week on T-Mobile’s website, which is a new version of the streaming dongle launched with the TVision service. It comes with a remote bearing Netflix, YouTube, and Google Assistant buttons and connects with accessories like game controllers and headphones via Bluetooth or USB-C. Like Chromecast, it supports 4K HDR streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2Ke8J"&gt;T-Mobile (probably wisely) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356978/t-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv"&gt;shuttered its streaming TV subscription service&lt;/a&gt; just six months after it launched, opting instead to partner with YouTube TV and Philo. While the service is gone, it seems that the company wasn’t ready to let go of the TVision branding. The TVision Hub is available now for $50 and is offered free with a new home internet line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IBM and Samsung say their new chip design could lead to week-long battery life on phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFtBIa3RpclMEA3TSrbpjdjHGII=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70273710/IBM_VTFET_06_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0tDiZa"&gt;IBM and Samsung have announced their latest advance in semiconductor design: a new way to stack transistors vertically on a chip (instead of lying flat on the surface of the semiconductor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L34wNy"&gt;The new Vertical Transport Field Effect Transistors (VTFET) design is meant to succeed the current FinFET technology that’s used for some of today’s most advanced chips and could allow for chips that are even more densely packed with transistors than today. In essence, the new design would stack transistors vertically, allowing for current to flow up and down the stack of transistors instead of the side-to-side horizontal layout that’s currently used on most chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOARl7"&gt;Vertical designs for semiconductors have been a trend for a while (FinFET already offers some of those benefits); Intel’s future roadmap also looks to move in that direction, too, although &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21285821/intel-3d-stacked-lakefield-chips-hybrid-core-atom-arm-processor"&gt;its initial work focused on stacking chip components&lt;/a&gt; rather than individual transistors. It makes sense, after all: when you’ve run out of ways to add more chips in one plane, the only real direction (other than physically shrinking transistor technology) is to go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EfOJG8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OF3Zwfu6Ngc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bGi4IA"&gt;While we’re still a ways away from VTFET designs being used in actual consumer chips, the two companies are making some big claims, noting that VTFET chips could offer a “two times improvement in performance or an 85 percent reduction in energy use” compared to FinFET designs. And by packing more transistors into chips, IBM and Samsung claim that VTFET technology could help keep Moore’s law’s goal of steadily increasing transistor count moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEIwCs"&gt;IBM and Samsung are also citing some ambitious possible use cases for the new technology, raising the idea of “cell phone batteries that could go over a week without being charged, instead of days,” less energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining or data encryption, and even more powerful IoT devices or even spacecraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LZkJt"&gt;IBM has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422815/ibm-2nm-chip-processors-semiconductors-power-performance-technology"&gt;previously shown off its first 2nm chip&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, which takes a different route toward cramming more transistors by scaling up the amount that can be fit onto a chip using the existing FinFET design. VTFET would aim to take things further, however, although it’ll likely be even longer before we see chips based on IBM and Samsung’s latest technology out in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ot8iS"&gt;It’s not the only company looking to the future of production, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;Intel previewed its upcoming RibbonFET&lt;/a&gt; (Intel’s first &lt;a href="https://blog.lamresearch.com/finfets-give-way-to-gate-all-around/"&gt;gate-all-around transistor&lt;/a&gt;) design over the summer, its own successor to FinFET production technology, which is set to be part of the Intel 20A generation of semiconductor products scheduled to start ramping production in 2024. The company also recently announced its own plan &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-components-research-looks-beyond-2025.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;CID=iosm&amp;amp;icid=100002749961528%257Calways-on&amp;amp;linkId=100000094062584#gs.jewhz0"&gt;for stacked transistor technology&lt;/a&gt; as a potential successor for RibbonFET in the future, too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wvgYEa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1092790/view/3141821139285428848"&gt;Kacyee’s Mod&lt;/a&gt;, available now as a playable beta, adds new cards, items, and a difficulty modifier that make &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;’s already challenging card game even spicier. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DMullinsGames"&gt;Daniel Mullins&lt;/a&gt;, the creator of &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;, says he made this mod in response to fans’ overwhelming support of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVqmt0"&gt;“This mini-expansion is in part an expression of my gratitude,” Mullins wrote on Steam. “I have received countless requests for an endlessly playable version of Part 1 that emphasizes Leshy’s deckbuilding roguelike as a standalone experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pfveY"&gt;Part one of &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt; locks you in a cabin with a vicious woodsman who will only release you if you beat him in a succession of card games. Through progress across three maps and solving an assortment of escape-room style puzzles, players earn new cards, enhance current cards, and assemble a collection of items that can turn a lost game in your favor sometimes at a gruesome price. Players familiar with&lt;em&gt; Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt; will recognize their elements in &lt;em&gt;Inscryption.&lt;/em&gt; The cards you use to beat the woodsman have attack and life values and unique abilities that synergize with one another to create devastatingly overpowered combos that are an utter delight to assemble and trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vPB3c"&gt;From beginning to end, &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt; is a shining achievement in storytelling and gameplay, and &lt;em&gt;Inscryption&lt;/em&gt;’s first act is the strongest, most compelling, most addictingly fun part of that achievement. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22757407/inscryption-review-pc-steam-devolver-digital"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I lamented that the game ended, wishing there was some way to set the game on an endless loop of deckbuilding and boss fights. Kaycee’s Mod is an answer to my and many others’ wish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apl8Ls"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge denies California’s attempt to intervene in Activision Blizzard settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZAbzS2vlt27ZeuUIDFDBJ6MfXds=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70271586/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0j2ciR"&gt;Today in federal court, a judge said she will deny the state of California’s attempt to intervene in the $18 million settlement between Activision Blizzard and the EEOC, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/activision-judge-denies-california-bid-to-challenge-settlement"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjyDpc"&gt;The denial prevents the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing from joining the EEOC’s lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in order to oppose the consent decree that accompanies the creation of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;$18 million settlement fund&lt;/a&gt;. The DFEH filed the objection in October, stating that the consent decree would harm the state’s case against Activision Blizzard, asserting the decree could, among other adverse outcomes, potentially allow for the destruction of evidence necessary to the state’s case or release the company from state claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRA2C5"&gt;The EEOC and the DFEH &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737003/activision-blizzard-discrimination-lawsuit-dfeh-response"&gt;have been at odds&lt;/a&gt; over their respective cases against Activision Blizzard. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735273/activision-blizzard-requests-stay-in-harassment-lawsuit-alleging-conflict-of-interest"&gt;Activision Blizzard filed a stay&lt;/a&gt; against the DFEH lawsuit claiming some of the lawyers involved in the state’s case should be disqualified based on conflict of interest rules. Activision Blizzard filed this stay after the EEOC brought this conflict of interest information to its attention, which was notably after the DFEH objected to the EEOC’s consent decree and settlement. In &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report, the judge brought up this spat between the two public offices, calling it “unseemly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HK4bke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DFEH filed the objection in October, stating that the consent decree would harm the state’s case against Activision Blizzard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2vTxk"&gt;Though the DFEH will not be allowed to object to the consent decree, that doesn’t mean the judge will allow the $18 million price tag to remain. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823991/activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-victim-press-conference"&gt;In a press conference last week&lt;/a&gt;, celebrity lawyer Lisa Bloom, on behalf of one of Activision Blizzard’s victims, said the settlement was “woefully inadequate” and asked for an increased fund of at least $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DV9buN"&gt;The EEOC and Activision Blizzard will submit clarifications on the consent decree to the court in January. The state of California will have the opportunity to submit comments, and a formal ruling on the decree should come soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for working from home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bH6jbLi3TDyvU9UoR_NtRR4DuJc=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70177496/Work_from_home.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts to outfit the home office of a working professional&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8r44SV"&gt;Many of us have been working from home for more than a year and a half, and some of us will continue to do so — maybe forever. That said, buying a gift for a friend or loved one who works from home can be tricky. One person might prioritize tech, while another might care more about plant life and energizing lighting. If you need some help, however, you’ve come to the right place. Here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;we have some expertise in working from home, and we have some great ideas for you to consider before time runs out and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3edj4"&gt;What makes the ideal home office? Well, the right tech, like the Satechi USB-C Multi-Port Adapter ($80) and the Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced mouse ($100), are essential to getting work done. But comfort is also important, which is why we’ve included a standing desk, a laptop stand, and an ergonomic chair that can last for years. And if your gift recipient is one who enjoys blowing off steam and a good laugh, an impulse buy like a single-shot Nerf Jolt blaster ($4) may be all they need to keep their sanity. We’ve got ideas big and small, both for physical comfort and a sound state of mind. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is rolling out automatic captions for videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pLQRWvfgXR8kFulym7HHUbG0iQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270185/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xakdgA"&gt;In a major boon for accessibility, Twitter is now rolling out automatic captions for videos, the company announced Tuesday. Auto captions will be available globally on iOS, Android, and the web in “most languages,” according to Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PalhwE"&gt;However, there’s one significant catch with the automatic captions: they’ll only appear on &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; videos uploaded to Twitter. Old videos that don’t have captions still won’t have them. There’s also no way to report inaccurate or bad captions, a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; though they say “we’re always looking at ways to improve our accessibility features.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyBmrg"&gt;Twitter has a somewhat rocky history with accessibility features, though it has taken steps to improve. The company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;heavily criticized&lt;/a&gt; for launching voice tweets in 2020 without captions, and it came to light soon after that Twitter didn’t have a dedicated accessibility team at the time. Twitter has since created &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible"&gt;two teams focused on accessibility&lt;/a&gt;, and it did eventually add captions to voice tweets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579420/twitter-voice-tweets-captions"&gt;though more than a year after they first launched&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has also added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;live captions to Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its Clubhouse-like audio room product.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gotta go fast: Sonic is coming to Tesla’s in-car system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Tesla Model 3 interior is displayed with a Sega Genesis game controller sitting under the infotainment screen with a window on the screen showing the game Sonic 1." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJcBDfppqsq9FOUW-AARRUMmgDs=/0x283:4032x2971/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70271208/IMG_0936.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Sonic 1 title screen opened in the Tesla web browser (the game is not available yet)&lt;/em&gt; | Image: The Verge (By Umar Shakir)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M4B0Ej"&gt;Sega is bringing back the original 1991 &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; game — this time for Tesla Arcade. A PR representative for the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 1&lt;/em&gt; will be available on all Tesla models but did not share a timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGy15N"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted about the new Sonic game by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816202/courtney-love-elon-musk-bernie-sanders-kendall-roy-succession-taxes"&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt; pestering senator Bernie Sanders. The Tesla CEO replied to his own November tweet of a Bernie Sanders “once again asking” meme where the senator is poorly photoshopped with Dr. Robotnik’s mustache and glasses... asking for Chaos Emeralds (the in-game secret power-ups scattered in each zone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LS0OLc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sonic, the Hedgehog, game coming to all Teslas!&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1469957953142808579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cHSUQp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; is the crazy-fast side scroller where the titular blue hedgehog rushes to the finish while collecting golden rings. As a grim reminder: it’s the one where pressing Down and A does nothing — though some re-releases (and there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of re-releases) did add the &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2&lt;/em&gt; “spin-dash” move that hurls Sonic forward from a stand-still.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On a table, there are four devices: an iPhone 13 mini, Genesis mini, Nintendo Switch with blue and red joy cons, and a rose gold MacBook Air. devices with screens are showing sonic the hedgehog 1 game. A sonic character image on a coaster is propped up in the genesis console slot." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6OAf0j-HWVz2sus3UTHSsYYi2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087525/IMG_2494.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge (by Umar Shakir)&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It took me four minutes to arrange a picture of four platforms that have Sonic 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivagsu"&gt;Speaking of re-releases,&lt;em&gt; Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; is available on almost every platform — and is not regarded as the best of the main Sonic games (&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writers agree &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic &amp;amp; Knuckles,&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Sonic 3 &amp;amp; Knuckles&lt;/em&gt; are all far superior games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dqau3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; is also a much more repetitive game since there are six “Zones” with three long acts each, compared to 10 zones with two acts each in &lt;em&gt;Sonic 2&lt;/em&gt; — giving players a lot more variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqHsQh"&gt;Tesla Arcade has become the cause of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823127/tesla-car-arcade-games-safety-nhtsa"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; because some games work while the vehicle is in motion. Recent games added to the Tesla Arcade such as &lt;em&gt;Sky Force Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; will work while you’re driving, but it remains to be seen if &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; will also work that way. “Passengers turn into players as they race at lightning speed across classic zones,” reads the statement &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received from Sega — a reminder that games are only for passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtvHPL"&gt;It’s cool to see Tesla still releasing new games — and though the company has not yet delivered on promises of high-end games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for the new Model S &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22462660/amd-tesla-model-x-s-plaid-ryzen-radeon-rdna-2"&gt;with an AMD chipset&lt;/a&gt;, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/2/18649466/tesla-car-cuphead-elon-musk-interview-summer-release"&gt;teased and released&lt;/a&gt; platformers like &lt;em&gt;Cuphead &lt;/em&gt;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0r0u5m"&gt;Sega tells us that the game will support a USB-connected controller, so we expect that a USB Genesis controller will work for the full-speed nostalgic experience of zipping through Green Hill Zone... just keep your seat belt on.&lt;/p&gt;
