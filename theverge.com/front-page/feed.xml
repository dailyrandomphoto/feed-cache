    <title>Go read why r/WallStreetBets was founded and how its creator left</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yttJta"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=mhp"&gt;has written an excellent profile&lt;/a&gt; of the man who started r/WallStreetBets, the subreddit that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;embroiled in controversy this week&lt;/a&gt;. His name is Jaime Rogozinski, and if you’re wondering how he’s been feeling about this whole thing, he likens it to “watching one of those horror films where you can see the bad guy slowly going up the stairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsX0vX"&gt;The article gives the impression that the subreddit, which is now trying to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;raise the price of GameStop stocks to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, wasn’t only created for profit — it was created for fun. Rogozinski was apparently bored with the usual stock market advice about just buying index funds and was looking for actual discussions about individual stocks. He also talks about how the community is “refreshing,” with posts ranging from “‘Look at my money!” to “Look at all this money I lost.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1BKq53"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s no longer what it used to be.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHhurd"&gt;As many classic stories go, though, the creation ends up turning on the creator. Rogozinski is no longer a moderator for the subreddit; he was booted off last April after clashing with moderators that he said “were straight up white supremacists.” This is a problem, it seems, that the community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;has been dealing with for a while&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W763Sm"&gt;It’s an excellent story, and it gives great insight into what happens when a community becomes something its creator never intended and the fallout that can have on the creator’s life. If you’ve been following the story of WallStreetBets, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=mhp"&gt;definitely worth a read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>E-Trade won’t let you buy GameStop and AMC stock either, reports now say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y20Wg8"&gt;Financial services company E-Trade has restricted purchases of GameStop and AMC stock, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/e-trade-restricts-purchases-of-gamestop-amc-shares?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;amp;cmpId=google"&gt;a source tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two stocks have become popular on forums like the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and seen their prices skyrocket to unprecedented highs over the past week. (GameStop hit $483 earlier on Thursday and briefly went above that during the day. Last Thursday, the stock closed at $43.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVjHDf"&gt;We’ve seen users on Twitter report that they have been unable to buy the stocks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pATOKr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;writes that an E-Trade representative declined to comment, and the company didn’t immediately respond to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeinEl"&gt;E-Trade follows other stock-trading platforms in placing restrictions on the stocks. Robinhood added new limits to its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;to restrict buying or trading&lt;/a&gt; GameStop, AMC, and other stocks that are popular on r/WallStreetBets on Thursday morning. Angry Robinhood users are now &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;calling for a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; as a result and have even made &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;a subreddit focused on creating that lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Leaked images suggest Sony’s camera-focused Xperia 1 III might have a much better zoom lens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQWZwLl3UMsHlMWxsit__CC7QEk=/342x0:4040x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736338/1iiiresized.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alleged leaked renders of the upcoming flagship show Sony sticking with a minimalist design and tall form factor. | Image: OnLeaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AzD07h"&gt;An early look at Sony’s next flagship phone shows it might be getting a more powerful zoom lens, thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-sonys-new-flagship-the-xperia-1-iii-1611846138-426237886"&gt;leaked renders posted by OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;. The Xperia 1 III’s rear camera bump appears similar to its predecessor’s at first glance. But if you look closely at the bottom camera, it features a squared-off housing consistent with periscope designs. Previous Xperia phones have offered standard telephoto lenses with 2x or 3x optical zoom; a periscope design would allow for 5x or more of optical reach without sacrificing image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VT9iw"&gt;OnLeaks also reports that the Xperia 1 III will include 5G, practically a requirement for any flagship phone in 2021. Unlike the Xperia 1 II, it seems likely that Sony will offer 5G support for 1 III devices sold in the US, given that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248440/sony-xperia-pro-5g-price-release-date-news-features"&gt;creator-focused Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; will offer it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2w1u5"&gt;On the whole, it looks like the Xperia 1 III will stick with Sony’s minimalist approach. The 6.5-inch display’s bezels are very thin, and Sony is sticking with the tall 21:9 aspect ratio. The 1 III should also retain the 3.5mm headphone jack — a rarity among flagships — as well as a microSDXC card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rULqlb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10308187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RRT8o"&gt;Despite being a major manufacturer of imaging hardware, Sony’s phones have lagged behind other flagships in the camera department with better software. When we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21322518/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-smartphone-new-camera-photo-pro"&gt;reviewed the Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, we saw an opportunity for Sony to lean into the dedicated camera-like experience that the phone can offer, rather than trying to play catch-up on computational photography. Strengthening its hardware offerings with a good-quality zoom is a solid step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate to hold hearing on the stock market after Reddit GameStop squeeze</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Confirmation Hearing For Federal Reserve Governor Nominees Judy Shelton And Christopher Waller" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/55kLcgKtLSY7SuY8lEUgcjTCD50=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736290/1200544025.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKfgqn"&gt;Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), the incoming chair of the Senate Banking Committee, announced Thursday that he plans to hold a hearing on the “current state of the stock market” in the wake of unprecedented volatility around GameStop, AMC, and other stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga0Oaz"&gt;The volatility has been most pronounced around the retailer GameStop, which has more than quadrupled in value over the past week in the face of a Reddit-organized campaign to boost the company’s value. But with several markets blocking further purchases of the stock to stem hedge fund losses, the incident has sparked a broader conversation about institutional bias in US financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0Aod3"&gt;“People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they’re the ones getting hurt. American workers have known for years the Wall Street system is broken — they’ve been paying the price,” Brown said in a statement Thursday. “It’s time for the SEC and Congress to make the economy work for everyone, not just Wall Street. That’s why, as incoming Chair of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee I plan to hold a hearing to do that important work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7j5N4z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NEW: Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on "the current state of the stock market," incoming Chairman Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CX1zj8HHVo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CX1zj8HHVo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Flatley (@DanielPFlatley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanielPFlatley/status/1354881143896760326?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vpKNBd"&gt;As of publication, it’s unclear when the hearing will take place, but lawmakers from both chambers have expressed a need for further investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ae6rP"&gt;Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), the chair of the House Financial Services committee, also pledged to investigate the activity. “I will convene a hearing to examine recent activity around GameStop stock and other impacted stocks,” Waters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elwasson/status/1354902287488057344"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, “with a focus on short selling, online trading platforms, gamification and their systemic impact on our capital markets and retail investors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFox91"&gt;Earlier Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;called on Congress to investigate&lt;/a&gt; the Robinhood app, calling the actions against GameStop “unacceptable.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Other progressives have followed suit. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) put out a statement saying, “We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,” he continued. “We need more regulation and equality in the markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROKsuH"&gt;On Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also called for further regulation of the financial industry. “It’s long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs — and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UGTBi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from Rep. Waters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carrot Weather gets a fresh new design and a bigger shift to subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lN5sEiwjI5IK8EZ6izco50_DCZk=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735971/promo_presets.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brian Mueller&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xQwx6x"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id961390574"&gt;Carrot Weather&lt;/a&gt; — the entertainingly antagonistic weather application from developer Brian Mueller — just got its latest version 5.0 update, which brings a whole new (and far more customizable) design, removes the upfront price tag in favor of more subscription tiers, and, of course, adds new dialogue and Easter eggs for the app’s malevolent AI character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yQnbD"&gt;It’s been a few years since Mueller released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16004062/carrot-weather-4-update-ai-app-ios-dark-sky-forecast-fun"&gt;Carrot Weather 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, and the new update brings a fresh coat of paint to the weather app, with more detailed data that’s broken down into individual cards for things like Moon phases, wind speed, precipitation, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1X8ykyctXGF42743dYRBl-wtWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266256/promo_darkmode.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jWF0FT"&gt;Users are also able to fully customize the layout of those interface cards based on the information that’s important to them, and they can swap between different custom layouts easily. (For example, a frequent skier might want to build a layout that focuses on snowfall and wind speed forecasts.) Everything has been visually updated to be more in line with modern iOS UI standards so the whole app will fit more seamlessly alongside the rest of your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6D3plc"&gt;The new app also is now free to use, instead of charging $4.99 upfront to use. Like the old paid version, though, there are still optional subscription services that can be layered on top for more functionality. A Premium subscription ($4.99 per month or $19.99 per year) adds additional features like selecting weather sources, notifications, widgets, and Apple Watch complications. Premium Ultra ($9.99 per month or $39.99 per year) adds notifications for rain and storms, more widgets, and better data source switching. And a Premium Family subscription ($14.99 per month or $59.99 per year) is the same as Premium Ultra but can be shared through Apple’s Family Sharing with up to five other people. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zpEbtzKe9hOWCGws3PMTt12NKzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266257/promo_interfacemaker.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Brian Mueller&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot’s new customizable Interface Maker tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FQchb8"&gt;If you’ve already been a Carrot owner, though, you’ll get to keep any paid features you already had forever, even if they’ve been moved to one of the pricier tiers. Similarly, existing subscribers to the old Premium Club memberships will be able to continue to pay those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18632642/carrot-weather-app-update-precipitation-notifications-rain-snow-storm-cell-custom-critical-alerts"&gt;lower monthly or yearly prices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlPmy5"&gt;The free version of Carrot Weather includes ads — but for now, they’re either for entirely fake products or for other indie applications. (Mueller says he’s not getting paid for those, either, but views them as a way of “giving back to the awesome indie developer community.”) That said, he notes that he may end up selling ads in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qKEI0"&gt;Carrot Weather 5.0 is available to download now on the App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y16qh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDHmU6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After buy ban, GameStop hypebeasts are looking for a Robinhood alternative</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB_SWRTdr9yrUDqwCWGKo4Dh5WE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68734726/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Smd00e"&gt;In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced that it would temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;block investors&lt;/a&gt; from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;unexpected rallies over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;. But for the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block is being treated as an outright betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLCypZ"&gt;Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as the reason it prevented additional trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HG1HjA"&gt;Since the decision, Robinhood’s app on the App Store has received thousands of one-star reviews as a form of practice known as review bombing. On the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, angry Robinhood users are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;calling for a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; because “allowing people to only sell is the definition of market manipulation,” according to one post. There’s even a new subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/"&gt;specifically for suing the company&lt;/a&gt;. Another Robinhood &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewNiss/status/1354821478613540864"&gt;user tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that after years of being on the platform, the move felt like a “slap to the face,” adding “to be regulated in a time of absolute prime opportunities is an embarrassment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDJVPq"&gt;On Twitter, beloved rapper and Fyre Fest promoter Ja Rule did not mince words: “Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmLLDl"&gt;Robinhood has been central to much of the chaos within the financial sector over the last few days. Investors from r/WallStreetBets or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;its private Discord server&lt;/a&gt; used the personal finance app to inflate GameStop and other stocks as a blow against Wall Street hedge funds. But now that Robinhood has taken steps to stem the rally, the r/WallStreetBets community feels betrayed — and is already looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FoWbo1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwG0Kz"&gt;The list of brokerages that have stopped allowing trades and buys of the aforementioned stock continue to grow: Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have all &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354828730674372610"&gt;halted trading&lt;/a&gt;. TD Ameritrade has placed “restrictions on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; transactions in $GME and other securities,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Those restrictions “may include actions like increasing margin requirements, or limiting certain types of transactions, like short sales and those that may involve unlimited risk,” the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTNmR7"&gt;After initial publication, Public, an app similar to Robinhood, briefly stopped its users from trading and buying certain stock. The company issued a statement on Twitter, noting, “Our clearing firm, Apex Holdings, has decided to halt the buying of $KOSS, $GME, and $AMC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoShqP"&gt;“We disagree with this decision and are working hard for our members to resolve the issue,” the statement continues. “We’ll provide updates here as they happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxnXvm"&gt;Around 2:45pm ET on Thursday, Public allowed its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1354877232762810370"&gt;users to purchase stock again&lt;/a&gt; from companies like AMC and GameStop. WeBull, which temporarily restricted trades on stock from companies like GameStop and AMC, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354875836810342400"&gt;lifted those restrictions&lt;/a&gt; around 2:40pm ET on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hgz8G1"&gt;For Robinhood competitors like Public, it’s a golden opportunity. In fact, Public even doubled the free stock slice &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/public/status/1354810368191733770"&gt;for member referrals&lt;/a&gt;. Popular YouTube personality Casey Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354794425528934405"&gt;tweeted on Thursday morning&lt;/a&gt; just after the Robinhood halting began that “everyone complaining about @RobinhoodApp delisting GameStop and I’m over here on @public about to get Bill Gates rich.” He later said that no one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795210765606913"&gt;should take investment advice from him&lt;/a&gt; and that he’s an investor in Public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;“Also im an investor in public and i hope this ridiculous behavior from Robinhood brings attention to superior companies (like Public),” Neistat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Casey/status/1354795211713470467"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xstnn2"&gt;Switching to a competitor will still add some friction — and might cost investors valuable time in an exceptionally volatile situation. When creating an account on Public, for instance people may have to wait a few days for their application to be approved, according to a message that appears during the signup process. If people are trying to get in on GameStop and AMC while the magic rally is still in effect, that delay might defeat the purpose — although at least one &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reporter had their account approved in the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YZqB5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u78AiF"&gt;Most apps also allow investors to &lt;a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/2673094-can-i-transfer-another-investment-account-to-public"&gt;transfer their portfolios&lt;/a&gt; from other brokerages, including Robinhood, which could be faster. But there’s still likely to be a significant delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsfbgR"&gt;Webull is another investment app, and the FAQ states that “in most cases, account application is approved automatically.” Webull’s website also states that people can trade in the same day if “you deposit via ACH before 4:00 pm on a trading day” — basically, if funds are transferred from something like a bank to Webull. The site also states, however, that people “will get a provisional credit (up to $1000 depending on the incoming deposit) of buying power after your deposit,” which gives people “provisional buying power to trade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XbLN8"&gt;Transferring stocks from one app to another, or flocking to another app to buy stocks, seems tedious — but as long as it’s unclear when Robinhood and other brokerages will allow purchases, GameStop’s new stockholders are left with no other choice. At the time of publication, GameStop’s stock was sitting at $155 — down from yesterday’s high of $468, but still more than triple where the stock was last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AVdH3"&gt;“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich,” popular YouTube creator Ricky “FaZe Banks” Bengston &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Banks/status/1354786829388500998"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “You guys fkn blew it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjCjvW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 28th, 1:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story has been updated to note that Public stopped allowing users to buy and trade certain stock. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlkdEx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2, January 28th, 2:45pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The story has been updated to note that WeBull has removed restrictions on trading. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU5kTd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2, January 28th, 2:56pm ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The story has been updated to note that Public has removed restrictions on certain stocks, allowing people to buy them once more. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDul1v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction January 28th, 1:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story said that TD Ameritrade halted purchases of certain stock. TD Ameritrade still allows stock to be bought, but there are restrictions in place, like increasing margin requirements. &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt; regrets the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord is no longer banning r/WallStreetBets — it’s helping them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hK3nzoAWcwhd6yHEdl9KuvMpfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735747/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="izl1Wn"&gt;Discord is now helping the r/WallStreetBets team moderate its new server. The company originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned the group yesterday&lt;/a&gt; due to “hateful and discriminatory content” and revealed it had sent repeated warnings to the team managing the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iDzDm"&gt;Those warnings, for whatever reason, were ignored, but now the r/WallStreetBets team and Discord are working together. Discord staff are actively working with the server’s team to help with moderation. At least one Discord staffer, who is now in the new WallStreetBets server, is also helping with infrastructure problems related to the rapid growth the community is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZJkXq"&gt;“WallStreetBets members have set up a new server and we are working with them,” says a Discord spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We will welcome the group back so long as they improve their moderation practices and follow our Community Guidelines. We have reached out to the moderators to provide them with support and advice, like we do for many of our large communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JceCGA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Discord has turned into a virtual trade floor with memes, stonks, and chaos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="31iES1"&gt;Discord was left in an awkward position yesterday, after the largely unmoderated server suddenly grew in size and got out of control. It could either let hate speech continue in a community it wouldn’t normally ban or act to shut it down after repeated warnings. The ban appears to have worked to get the r/WallStreetBets moderators to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOL67h"&gt;Hours after the ban, the moderators of the subreddit criticized Discord publicly. “We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore,” said the r/WallStreetBets subreddit moderators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FqbcK"&gt;The new WallStreetBets Discord server currently has 296,000 members, and it continues to grow every second. It has played a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;central role in the subreddit’s ongoing mission&lt;/a&gt; to drive up the price of GameStop and AMC stock. We’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;following the Discord server growth over the past few days&lt;/a&gt;, and while it was full of profanity and racial slurs yesterday, whatever work Discord is doing behind the scenes appears to be working to reduce that content today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qc9pqa"&gt;There are now fewer people screaming in calls, using racial slurs, or blasting music to the hundreds listening in. The memes are now mainly emoji and text, rather than images that often included offensive material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwMglC"&gt;We’ve asked Discord exactly what is being done to improve moderation for text-, image-, and audio-based communications and how the company was able to resolve its differences with the WallStreetBets. The company wasn’t able to provide details at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft made a giant climate pledge one year ago — here’s where it’s at now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Offices Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buFoTifosoQt4k7bm3W9yCjQh7Y=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735376/1230784777.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iDzTqO"&gt;One year after pledging to remove all of its historic and future planet-heating emissions within a few decades, Microsoft says it has already slashed its carbon footprint by 6 percent. It’s an incremental change that’s in line with what’s needed globally to address the climate crisis, but there is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="cCwnfF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a whole lot of work left for Microsoft to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmvLM1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068799/microsoft-carbon-capture-climate-change"&gt;Last January&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pledged to do something that, at the time, was pretty unheard-of: it planned to become carbon &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; by 2030. That gave the company a deadline to capture more planet-heating carbon dioxide than it emits. Not only would it target future emissions, but the company also pledged that, by 2050, it would remove the equivalent of all the carbon dioxide it’s released since being founded in 1975. It made those promises even though the technology to make it all happen doesn’t yet exist at commercial scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUkQXL"&gt;Now, we’re beginning to get a glimpse of what’s actually feasible for Microsoft to achieve. Some of the reduction in climate pollution it accomplished last year was a result of the economic toll of the pandemic. Microsoft will need to continue making cuts year on year without the help of a global crisis. The sustainability report it released today also showed how much the company can actually rely on carbon-removal technologies — which, at the moment, is not very much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGRldy"&gt;When companies set goals to become carbon neutral, or carbon negative in Microsoft’s case, the company &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; saying it will stop pumping out greenhouse gases altogether. What it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do is cancel out some portion of its greenhouse gases by paying other companies and nonprofit organizations to trap and store carbon dioxide. The tricky part of these corporate sustainability pledges is that it’s not usually clear how much carbon dioxide the company plans to cut altogether versus how much it will continue to pollute and then pay to remove from the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L34FTJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUBsUq"&gt;In Microsoft’s case, we now know that the company plans to cut its emissions “by more than half” by 2030. That implies that, in the future, it intends to rely on carbon-removal schemes to make up for almost half of all its carbon emissions. In its &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4Mxso"&gt;2020 fiscal year&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft released 11,164,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Since making its carbon-removal pledge last January, the company says it purchased contracts to capture 1.3 million metric tons of CO2, over 11 percent of its total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vf5Btl"&gt;Companies can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by funding reforestation projects or technology that captures the greenhouse gas from the air. So far, Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/01/28/sustainability-year-progress-decade-action/"&gt;relied mostly on forests&lt;/a&gt; to suck up and store its carbon emissions. Less than 1 percent of the carbon Microsoft said it removed from the atmosphere last year was seized through emerging direct air capture technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tg9SR"&gt;“Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem and the world must build a new market on an unprecedented scale and timeline, from nearly scratch,” Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/01/28/one-year-later-the-path-to-carbon-negative-a-progress-report-on-our-climate-moonshot/#_ftn1"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post today. Microsoft started a $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund last year to accelerate the growth of that “ecosystem,” but much more will be needed to make carbon removal a successful strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIhUAA"&gt;Companies relying on forests to erase their carbon footprint comes with pitfalls, too. Although the strategy is now being folded into the umbrella term of “carbon removal,” it’s typically been described in the past as carbon “offsets.” Offsets have gotten a bad rap because &lt;a href="https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into them have shown that they haven’t actually succeeded in permanently trapping carbon dioxide. Companies can claim that they’re canceling out their effect on the climate, when in reality, they’re not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q8eAKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not the rocket that will take us to the Moon.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qRPGfn"&gt;Microsoft funded three conservation projects through the Nature Conservancy, which was the subject of a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-nature-conservancy-carbon-offsets-trees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; last year. Some of Nature Conservancy’s forest preservation projects allowed companies to claim they were shrinking their carbon footprints, when in reality, the forests were not threatened — so there was no additional benefit they were adding to the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2XNs9"&gt;Microsoft acknowledges that its reliance on these kinds of conservation projects is a “big weakness” in its initial work. “Reflecting the state of the market today and our immediate need for carbon removal, nearly all the carbon removal solutions we are purchasing are short-term and nature-based,” Smith wrote. “This is not the rocket that will take us to the Moon. The world needs to invent substantially stronger technology-based solutions than are available today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGmdt3"&gt;The world, including Microsoft, also needs to double down on efforts to stop polluting in the first place. Microsoft has laid out some plans on how it will do that. It’s tying executives’ pay to their performance on sustainability initiatives. The company said it will also work with suppliers to cut down their pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LW8yX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft needs to double down on efforts to stop polluting in the first place&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk4NqX"&gt;It also incentivizes teams within the company to come up with ways to make their products more sustainable. One notable result from the program: the company updated the Xbox to reduce the power it uses when it’s in “standby mode” from 15W to less than 2W. (Side note: &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/noah-horowitz/latest-game-consoles-environmental-winners-or-losers"&gt;settings still make a really big difference&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to making the console as energy efficient as possible, according to the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft sunk a data center to the bottom of the Scottish sea in 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qQXK7Y"&gt;Microsoft will also have to figure out how to reduce emissions from its data centers, which suck up a lot of energy and are a vital part of its business. It’s already looked into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436746/microsoft-project-natick-data-center-server-underwater-cooling-reliability"&gt;storing servers under the sea&lt;/a&gt;, which could save energy by keeping the servers cool naturally without requiring refrigeration. Data centers on land can also use up a lot of water as part of their cooling systems. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448896/microsoft-environmental-pledge-water-scarcity-data-centers"&gt;pledged last year&lt;/a&gt; to conserve and replenish water where it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyP6q4"&gt;Microsoft’s goal of halving emissions by 2030 falls in line with science-based targets. In order to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, the global economy will need to roughly halve emissions by 2030, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;landmark report&lt;/a&gt; by leading climate scientists. By 2050, the world will need to gut emissions to near zero. Carbon removal may offer a small assist, but to get to the Moon, the heavy lifting will have to come from elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is testing clips on live streams and VODs</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3XqbaSQbtRVshlRyA2KsN3hgY4=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68735325/youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xVCqa1"&gt;YouTube &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/95526465"&gt;is introducing clipping&lt;/a&gt; — the ability to make short clips of live streams or videos — starting today with a small group of creators. Those clips can be anywhere between five and 60 seconds in length and will have a new URL associated with them. Creators and viewers will be able to create clips by clicking on the clip icon, though the feature is currently limited to desktop and Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9LNE4"&gt;It’s a smart move from YouTube, because clipping is something of a live-streaming industry standard. You can more easily share live video content via a short video clip that can be passed around social media, rather than requiring viewers to skim through a potentially hourslong stream. Every platform from Twitch to the dearly departed site Mixer has decided that it’s something their creators need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6PrDZu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today we are launching an experimental version of Clips on YouTube. Check out videos on the Creator Insider channel and test it out yourself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clips are 5-60 sec, shareable, segments of content (Live/VOD) that live on top of the original video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj"&gt;https://t.co/5fJyorxjrj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DVWNQ2BoEx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DVWNQ2BoEx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lester (@Chen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Chen/status/1354837070460555264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="94ajXm"&gt;YouTube adding the feature is just another signal that the online video titan intends to beef up its live-streaming operation. As is the conventional wisdom in streamer spaces, clips help channels grow. A good clip that goes viral can bring in a huge influx of new viewers — and in streaming, where visibility is a big part of creating a sustainable income, that’s half the battle. &lt;/p&gt;
