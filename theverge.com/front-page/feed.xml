    <title>Uncharted’s first movie trailer is full of very familiar action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jlwERDUHrf0t1clrJmXXWafC9cg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025589/Uncharted_Thumbnail_16x9Textless.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WD2JKE"&gt;After over a decade of development (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21043622/uncharted-movie-director-travis-knight-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg"&gt;seven directors&lt;/a&gt;), it seems that Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie is finally, really, truly going to actually come out — &lt;a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/world_premiere_of_uncharted_movie_trailer"&gt;and it has the trailer to prove it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGImXX"&gt;Starring Tom Holland as an incongruously young version of fortune hunter / adventurer / general human punching bag Nathan Drake, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; is set long before the popular video game series, winding the clock back before Drake was a seasoned Indiana Jones knockoff to the start of his career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meHMUB"&gt;It is kind of hard to shake how young Holland looks here compared to his more grizzled video game counterpart, along with what appears to be an identical American accent to his Spider-Man voice in the Marvel films. But Sony will have plenty of time to convince fans to get on board in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hE8bN4SzT9bKWGn0ZqTJWCEruKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944479/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_9.13.47_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSiV5g"&gt;Despite ostensibly being a prequel, fans of the games will note that a lot of the action in the film looks &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;familiar: the big plane set piece looks ripped right out of &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception&lt;/em&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDXI4w"&gt;The film also features other notable &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; characters, even if they’ve been rendered virtually unidentifiable here: Mark Wahlberg is playing a mustache-less Sully (Nathan’s father figure / partner), while Sophia Taylor Ali is a young Chloe Frazer, who apparently knows Sully in this version of the franchise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOOpT2"&gt;To put some perspective on how long the film has been in development, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/mark-wahlberg-will-be-nathan-drake-deniro-could-be-dra-5698269"&gt;Wahlberg was originally set to play Drake himself&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, over a decade ago, when work started on the adaptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jziGq4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only major Naughty Dog video game adaptation in the works; the studio is also working with HBO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457686/merle-dandridge-hbo-the-last-of-us-adapatation-live-action"&gt;on a TV show version of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, set to star Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qB5ivu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; is set to finally hit theaters on February 18th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting ray tracing thanks to a Microsoft and AMD partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sgk-I62U8N_7-wWQd6qyvxf9nHE=/112x0:1318x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025569/Picture2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNsRH6"&gt;Microsoft has selected AMD as its exclusive PC partner for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. While this means plenty of marketing opportunities, it’s also fostered a closer engineering partnership with AMD that Microsoft says will improve frame rates in the campaign mode and eventually bring ray tracing to the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tveypM"&gt;“We’re looking forward to working closely with AMD to bring raytracing to&lt;em&gt; Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/halo-infinite-the-great-journey-on-pc/"&gt;says Noah Benesch&lt;/a&gt;, a product marketing manager at Xbox. “Raytracing is one our top development priorities post-launch and look forward to sharing more soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1qBHv"&gt;It’s not clear if this rules out Microsoft using Nvidia’s DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) technology, but Microsoft does note that AMD is “exceptionally open to us bringing new rendering features across all hardware as well as performance improvements for all our players.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKKIXsscRj5nhHzNbx60igXws74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944462/Picture2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD has created a Halo-themed RX 6900 XT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hwu7L8"&gt;Beyond ray tracing, which will presumably be available across both Xbox Series X / S and PC, Microsoft says the AMD partnership has resulted in driver updates that “deliver massive improvements in frame time performance throughout areas of the game’s campaign mode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfosT4"&gt;The engineering work has also improved &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; on processors with high core and thread counts, which is an area where AMD has excelled with its latest Ryzen processors. Microsoft and AMD have also created a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Radeon RX 6900 XT. It’s a limited-edition card that won’t be sold, but Microsoft and AMD will be hold giveaways for the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKYLPs"&gt;Outside of the AMD and Microsoft partnership, the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; team has also been working with Discord and Razer Chroma RGB to ensure the game integrates well. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; will support in-game Discord server invites and even Razer Chroma RGB support with unique lighting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s Verizon tablet is the only one you’ll find with 5G for $399</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QqrGLl8LDKRO8kQSeR_VEQ_nXmw=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025439/tcl_5g_tablet.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PiMOyo"&gt;TCL, the company best known for its affordable Roku-equipped 4K TVs, has a new budget-oriented $399.99 5G tablet — the Tab Pro 5G. The device is available to order via Verizon’s online “Buy More, Save More” promo, which takes $100 off if purchased with a qualifying Android device on a Verizon plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRryU4"&gt;Similar to its newer TVs that now offer Google TV in the US, TCL’s Tab Pro 5G continues the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt; with a standard set of Google apps... alongside the expected mass of Verizon bloatware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It comes in one color" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kUiJ3EgRl-CdUj2jVRdn3L2G4TE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944409/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_8.41.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tablet is meant to be held in widescreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1PM6zb"&gt;Tablets with 5G have not entered this price point yet. Verizon also sells the $669.99 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE 5G and the $649 iPad Mini with 5G. However, if you want an iPad with high-speed mmWave connections like this TCL slate has, your cheapest option is an 11-inch iPad Pro that starts at about $1,000. The technology’s limited range means it’s more useful if the signal is available within a block or two of where you live and play, but at this price point there just aren’t any other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZqbMS"&gt;The TCL Tab Pro 5G’s 10.36-inch (1200 x 2000 resolution) “NXTVISION” LCD screen is accompanied by stereo speakers that together provide an “impressive cinematic experience,” according to the company. Dark mode, reader mode, and a software HDR effect are included. Parents can screen-nanny their kids longer with a fast-charging 8,000mAh battery that TCL says can endure up to 17 hours of mixed use and can work as a power bank to charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXQCU"&gt;Optics include a front 8MP camera with face unlock and a rear 13MP shooter with LED flash and 1080p video capability. There’s no headphone jack, but the company includes a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box along with an 18W charger. On the edges of the tablet, you’ll also find a USB-C connector, fingerprint sensor, volume buttons, dual microphones, and what seems to be a five-pin accessory connector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 5-pin port of the TCL TAB Pro 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SjMC2AyzygpAktRU-MgsZz8Odk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944401/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_8.39.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mysterious five-pin connector is visible on the bottom of the landscape-oriented Tab Pro 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1rho03"&gt;The TCL Tab Pro 5G is equipped with Verizon mmWave and 802.11ac Wi-Fi (no Wi-Fi 6 here), 64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 1TB via microSD), and it’s running Android 11. With an eight-core Snapdragon 480 5G SoC and 4GB of RAM, it can probably handle light to medium gaming and a bit of productivity on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Messenger now lets an entire group share an AR experience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cjz2IoH6ovzF2-PfhCK__qIxcKE=/0x1:3239x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025349/Group_Effects_Header_Image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nEUsQK"&gt;Facebook Messenger is adding “group effects” that allow everyone on a video call to participate in the same augmented reality experience at the same time. The effects are available now across Messenger video calls as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233468/facebook-messenger-rooms-live-instagram-live-igtv-video-chat"&gt;Messenger Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, the service’s Zoom-like videoconferencing feature, and are coming soon to Instagram, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWt5iI"&gt;There are over 70 group effects available at launch, including a game where players compete to build a virtual burger, and another where a virtual orange cat photobombs the call. It’s a shift from the service’s existing augmented reality features, which tend to only apply to one participant at a time. Facebook says developers will be able to build more group effects using its Spark AR API from the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs2qi0"&gt;Alongside the shared group AR experiences, Facebook also announced a collection of smaller features coming to its chat services this month. New “word effects” will allow iOS Messenger users (and eventually Android users) to trigger an animation in a chat when a specific phrase is used. For example, &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/25/lets-celebrate-10-years-of-messenger/"&gt;in August the company showed&lt;/a&gt; how messaging the phrase “Happy Birthday!” could be set to trigger the party popper emoji to fly up the screen. There are also new “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578633/facebook-messenger-sound-emoji-soundmojis"&gt;Soundmojis&lt;/a&gt;” to tie in with &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, as well as chat themes and Halloween artwork for Messenger chats and Instagram DMs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s GeForce Now gets an RTX 3080 upgrade to take on Stadia and xCloud</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIypxjN4lZldgZ7EM7ulx1Ftj4A=/130x0:1150x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025411/GeForce_NOW_RTX_3080_Key_Visual_5168761692b8d87c638.18430752.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RTX 3080s are heading to Nvidia’s GeForce Now service.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qslg7F"&gt;Nvidia is launching dedicated, low-latency RTX 3080 gaming pods in the cloud before the end of 2021. GeForce Now will offer access to what Nvidia describes as “the most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built,” to stream PC games from Steam and the Epic Games Store to Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Android TV devices. Preorders begin today for select members of GeForce Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQEnPB"&gt;It’s a big moment for game streaming, as it’s rare to get access to machines in the cloud with the latest GPUs, especially one that PC gamers are still struggling to purchase in stores right now. Nvidia is also promising incredibly low latency for these dedicated RTX 3080 pods, with performance that should beat the majority of game consoles, PC gaming rigs, and competitors like Google Stadia and Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzMlxS-koOxX9JD-te5ihg3rfZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944298/GeForce_NOW_Ecosystem_5168761692b8ce49157.58524673.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeForce Now can stream games to most devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pg8L1F"&gt;“[Ten] years in the making, it’s a combination of everything that we’ve learned about cloud gaming and all the of best technology of GeForce gaming,” says Phil Eisler, the head of GeForce Now at Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wMLYX"&gt;The RTX 3080 option will be offered first to existing Founders and Priority members of GeForce Now in the US and Europe, with six-month memberships priced at $99.99. Preorders begin today, and the service should go live in the US in November and across Europe in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlXhd6"&gt;You’ll be able to stream at up to 1440p resolution with 120fps on PCs and Macs, and 4K HDR at 60fps on Nvidia’s Shield TV. The 4K option is limited to Shield TV at first, as not all TV streaming devices can handle h.265 decoding, so Nvidia is starting with its own Android TV device first before expanding to other hardware based on feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZQch4cEQ34fwPY-8K7PXjU8Hcec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944299/GeForce_NOW_SuperPod_5168761692b8f0fffc6.45897532.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s data center with dedicated RTX 3080 pods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bhSqlq"&gt;While Nvidia is marketing this as an RTX 3080 in the cloud, the company isn’t literally plugging retail RTX 3080 cards into data centers. Instead, it’s the equivalent performance from an Ampere GA102 chip that fits into servers. Still, Nvidia is equipping these servers with eight-core AMD Threadripper CPUs, 28GB of DDR4 memory, and a Gen4 SSD. Nvidia is promising 35 teraflops of GPU performance (that’s more like an RTX 3090), which is roughly three times what an Xbox Series X is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rnHhl"&gt;With all this hardware, Nvidia is hoping to greatly improve the latency you’re used to experiencing on game streaming services. Nvidia says an RTX 3080 in the cloud should result in less than 60ms of latency at 120fps playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;. The company claims it beats the 93ms latency seen with the same game running on an Xbox Series X at 60fps, and the 175ms latency of Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud). “Some of our competitors are still on their first generations, they’re still streaming close to 200ms of latency, which still feels pretty laggy,” says Eisler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZgAEH"&gt;Some titles, like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; are even faster, with Nvidia claiming below 50ms for &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; on its cloud RTX 3080 solution. To hit such impressive numbers, Nvidia is using its new Adaptive Sync technology to keep things smooth. It’s essentially the result of Nvidia’s work on G-Sync and Reflex to reduce latency in PC gaming, and put simply it’s the opposite of G-Sync. Nvidia is varying the game rendering to match a synchronous monitor, which allows it to sync streamed games to any 60Hz or 120Hz monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnP8cpEqpiqTUxprxlgn_nSGtWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944302/TvzQNXK.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia claims its RTX 3080 in the cloud can even beat an Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HcSTa4"&gt;On the server side, Nvidia uses its Adaptive Sync technology in the form of a driver that sits between the CPU and GPU to pace a game engine to sync with your local display refresh rate. It should reduce stutter by eliminating dropped and repeated frames, and on the server side it’s also eliminating some buffering between the CPU and GPU which should reduce latency overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdRt33"&gt;“The result is a perfectly smooth and synchronous cloud gaming stream, that’s the smoothest we’ve ever seen, as well as lower latency,” explains Eisler. “So really, I think a great technology to make it feel like you’re playing on a local computer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1lvAmE61uZvHb1we5Jp4wwSrRG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944300/GeForce_NOW_Product_Matrix_USD_5168761692b6f5ac048.96301665.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pricing options for GeForce Now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yfov70"&gt;Ultimately, latency will depend on how far away you’re playing from Nvidia’s data centers. The company has 30 data centers worldwide, covering 80 countries in total. Four new data centers are opening in the Southern Hemisphere, with one in Singapore, two in Australia, and a first data center in Brazil. You’ll also need a 35Mbps connection for 1440p at 120fps and a 40Mbps connection for 4K HDR on GeForce Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovQzay"&gt;We’ll be testing Nvidia’s RTX 3080 tier soon to see whether the latency claims hold up against game consoles, PC gaming rigs, and even services like Google Stadia and Xbox Cloud Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km3JRg"&gt;Alongside these data center upgrades, Nvidia is also rolling out a new GeForce Now client today. It includes beta support for the Microsoft Edge browser, which should also allow Xbox owners to stream PC games to their consoles through Edge. The update also includes Nvidia’s new Adaptive Sync technology, which will improve latency even for GeForce Now members who don’t opt for the new RTX 3080 tier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Duo 2 review: Duo-over or strike two?</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s second attempt at a folding phone rights a lot of the original’s wrongs, but doesn’t fix everything&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8WNgdd"&gt;Folding phones may be the future, but right now, they are still in their infancy. And in this weird time period where companies are still trying to figure out the best way for a folding phone to work, there are two camps: Samsung and others that fold a big screen down to a smaller, pocketable size, and Microsoft, which joins two screens with a hinge to create a digital book-like device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKhOjN"&gt;Microsoft’s first attempt at this, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;2020’s Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;, was not very good. It had a head-turning design and plenty of &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; factor, but the original Duo was, to put it bluntly, a hot mess. It lacked modern smartphone things like a proper camera, 5G, wireless charging, NFC, and an up-to-date processor. Even worse, the software was buggy and frustrating to use, with frequent crashes, poor touch response, and limited compatibility in third-party apps for its unique dual-screen features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajnX77"&gt;For this year’s attempt, the $1,499.99-and-up Surface Duo 2, Microsoft appears to have righted many of the original’s wrongs. It has an up-to-date processor, refined design, bigger battery, 5G support, NFC support, newer software, and an actual, honest-to-goodness proper camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yILKfZ"&gt;But once you get past all of those spec-sheet corrections, the Duo 2 still suffers from many of the same issues that plagued the first model. This is still very much a work in progress, one that I can’t recommend anyone buying until Microsoft figures it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IgeCAI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10819327"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlJxTL"&gt;The good thing about the Duo 2 is that it still has the original’s wow factor. This is just a flat-out cool-looking device and is almost sure to turn heads when used in public. The general design remains the same: it’s effectively two, full-size, super-thin smartphones joined by a 360-degree hinge. The two halves are slightly thicker than last year’s model, but they are still remarkably thin, and their added thickness makes the whole thing feel more substantial. It also offers room for a larger battery, which doesn’t have trouble reliably lasting me a day. Also, this year you can get it in white or black. My review unit is black, but I’m partial to the white model, which hides the fingerprints that collect on the glass much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOovoBL8HzRIsp3GwzKFyeGT5A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943436/dseifert_211017_4814_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2’s hinge is strong enough to hold the screens in any position you may need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p7AopV"&gt;The hinge is very nice — it’s smooth yet firm, so it can hold its position however you want it, and it makes it easy to switch from using two screens to just a single screen. The sides of the screens that meet the hinge have a curve, making it possible to see them through the hinge when the Duo 2 is closed. Microsoft is taking advantage of that space to display  limited notifications (missed calls, messages, battery level, and volume level, but no third-party apps), but it’s still not as convenient as a screen on the outside of the phone would be. I’ve also pinched my fingers in the hinge when opening the phone numerous times due to the curve — I’m not hurt, just embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kE1m65"&gt;The screens are slightly larger now — 5.8-inches each, effectively an 8.3-inch screen when combined — and they have a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother interactions and scrolling. They are still OLED panels, which provide punchy colors and deep blacks, and I didn’t have any issues viewing the screens outdoors in bright light. Their slightly larger size doesn’t actually make the footprint of the Duo 2 any larger than the first Duo — the unsightly bezels above and below the screens are now slightly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hEyeO76_JYx9u2C3jEci_reM824=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943440/dseifert_211017_4814_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 is slightly thicker than last year’s model, but it’s still impressively thin when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twpiCUhtqW2j_cjVyOCknGRDDsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943432/dseifert_211017_4814_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve of the screens lets you see part of them through the hinge when it’s closed — Microsoft is using this to show limited notification information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gr1nrw"&gt;Yet the Duo 2’s unique two-screen design makes it a lot wider than normal smartphones. It’s harder to fit into a pocket, and it’s too wide to comfortably reach across the screen with your thumb. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; has an additional screen on the outside of the phone, and while that screen may be a little small for comfort, it’s a much easier device to use in one hand for quick tasks and fits in my pants pockets easier when it’s closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cm8j1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Using the Duo 2 in one hand is far from an easy experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27F9bp"&gt;The Duo 2 is just really hard to use quickly or with one hand — that’s the main takeaway here. It’s not the kind of phone you can whip out of your pocket to pay for something or snap a pic; everything is much more belabored. Using the NFC chip to buy a snack with Google Pay requires opening the phone, unlocking it, folding the left screen back, and then tapping the phone on the reader. It’s not exactly fluid, but hey, last year’s model didn’t even have an NFC chip, so baby steps it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7apeZ"&gt;Microsoft made some other small but obvious tweaks to the external hardware. The fingerprint scanner is now integrated into the power button and the USB-C charging port is centered on the right half of the phone, which might be easier to use with certain charging docks. Sadly, the Duo 2 still doesn’t support wireless charging, which is an unfortunate omission at this price. It also doesn’t have any sort of water or dust resistance rating, something that Samsung has been able to add to its folding phones this year. You’ll want to be careful — that’s a lot of phone that can’t get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83i3Vr"&gt;Last year’s Duo had a lousy, single speaker; the Duo 2 now has a louder, clearer dual-speaker system. It makes watching video more enjoyable and it’s easier to hear speaker phone or video calls, but the speakers are not nearly as nice as the ones on Samsung’s Galaxy Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hov0QerFOj92l9Y6e8RGeeRGCAU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943445/dseifert_211017_4814_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can write notes on one screen while reviewing a website or document on the other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P8PNN5"&gt;The Duo 2 works with Microsoft’s various Surface Pens (sold separately), including the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pen Slim 2&lt;/a&gt;, for pen input. It doesn’t support the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710381/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-hands-on"&gt;Pen 2’s haptics&lt;/a&gt;, like you get with the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, but the writing experience with the new pen is much better than it was with the older models. The company is also selling a case that covers the front of the Duo 2 and lets you store and charge the Slim Pen or Slim Pen 2 through a magnetic attachment. The magnet is strong — the pen isn’t going to just fall off — but you do have to be careful when sliding the phone into a pocket to not dislodge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUYLf7"&gt;Unsurprisingly, pen input works best with Microsoft’s own OneNote and Sticky Notes apps. In other apps like Evernote, palm rejection and inking is not as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="niPOjU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Duo 2 has a camera system that the original lacked entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXtB8"&gt;The last big new hardware feature is the new triple-camera system on the back of the right screen. It’s comprised of a 12-megapixel, f/1.7 wide angle; 16-megapixel, f/2.2 ultrawide; and a 12-megapixel, f/2.4 2x telephoto camera. There are night and portrait modes and you can shoot 4K video up to 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aZ6Na"&gt;The camera housing sticks out from the back of the phone, like many other phone cameras do, which gets in the way when you try to fold back the left side and use just the right screen. So Microsoft cleverly angled the housing so the left screen sits flush against it. It doesn’t fold as flat as the first Duo in this position, but this is a fine compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WLUWR"&gt;Microsoft is also using the two screens to its advantage in the camera app to show you captured images on the left and your framing on the right. It’s easy to quickly see a full-size image right after you take it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoFS_G_J8RRDIZ0mklpFteaPl_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943429/dseifert_211017_4814_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2 now has an actual camera system, but its output is not very good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G67ZEj"&gt;But beyond that, there aren’t many positive things to say about this camera. For starters, because of the Duo’s design, you can’t take pics without opening the phone fully, and it’s very awkward to try to do it one-handed. The camera also hunts for focus a lot, is slow to capture images, and is generally just not very pleasant to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMmz2v"&gt;Image quality is a low point, too. Pictures are over-sharpened and flat, low-light images have lots of watercolor noise reduction and little detail. While it’s certainly an upgrade to the complete lack of a proper camera system in the first Duo, the Duo 2’s camera is hardly competitive with phones at its price point or even hundreds of dollars less. Google’s $500 Pixel 5A runs laps around this camera for a third of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TPvwV6fTcOJqUgFAvRvLLh61QuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943437/dseifert_211017_4814_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multitasking on the Duo 2 is easier than on just about any other phone you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jie2Tb"&gt;Despite those frustrations with the hardware, there are absolutely some cool things you can do with the Duo 2’s unique form factor. The two screens make it far easier to run two apps at the same time compared to split-screen modes on other phones or iPads. You literally just open one app on one screen and the second on the other and boom, you’re in multitasking bliss. I was able to call in to a Zoom meeting on one screen and follow along in a Google Doc on the other screen without missing a beat or feeling like I should have taken the call from my laptop. I can easily see my calendar when I’m responding to an email asking for a meeting, or I can mainline two social media feeds at the same time when doomscrolling through one just isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01PJQy"&gt;Those are all things you can do on other phones or tablets, but the Duo 2 makes it much easier to multitask in that fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dms7ph"&gt;There are limits to what you can do. Neither Microsoft’s own Edge browser nor Chrome allow you to open two websites side by side, so if you want to compare two sites, you have to use two browsers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j5l9n"&gt;You can “span” a single app across the two screens, but the apps that work best in that mode are primarily made by Microsoft, like Outlook, OneNote, and the Office suite. Most Android apps will just stretch themselves across the screens in an unsightly way, with a giant gap in the middle where the hinge is. Video is particularly bad when spanned across the two screens — you’ll want to stick to turning the phone on its side and just watching something on one of the screens in landscape. You can easily tent the phone to prop it up on a table or desk — no extra kickstand needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RmCzJBwaMQycJazUrCvzVonog3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943438/dseifert_211017_4814_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watching a video across two screens means dealing with a big gap in the middle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GKyA8a"&gt;Microsoft smartly worked with Amazon and Google to support the Kindle and Play Books apps on the dual screens, so when you span them you get one page on each screen, a digital facsimile of a book. A new feature in the Duo 2’s software (which Microsoft says will eventually be coming to the original Duo) is the ability to set an app to auto span every time you open it — so whenever I open the Kindle app, it automatically takes over both screens. It’s perhaps my favorite thing to do with a Duo and is more enjoyable to use than an actual Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU4jR4"&gt;The original Duo launched with Android 10 and had countless bugs. Many months later, it has received numerous updates, but it’s still on Android 10 and still has many of the same bugs. (Microsoft says it will get Android 11 before the end of this year.) The Duo 2 is launching with Android 11 and the company promises three years of updates, including monthly bug fixes and security patches. But it stops short of committing to a specific number of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y8vbc"&gt;The software on the Duo 2 is undeniably better than it was on the original at launch, and even where the first model is today after many bug fix updates. It’s faster, likely thanks to the Duo 2’s newer processor and more generous amount of RAM, and it’s more reliable and predictable. It has more features, like the aforementioned auto spanning mode and hinge notifications, plus basic quality of life things like automatic dark mode and night light modes for the display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKN_vzo7fu4EtEDLhN_K5haQpIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943448/dseifert_211017_4814_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading ebooks is one of the best experiences on the Duo 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W5EDpb"&gt;But it’s still in rough shape in a lot of ways and feels incomplete. The biggest issue by far is a familiar one to the Duo line: poor touch response. A lot of my taps on the screen just aren’t registered — I have to hit an icon twice to launch an app or send a message. Typing on the keyboard is particularly frustrating as a not-small percentage of my taps are ignored, slowing me down greatly. Even when writing with the pen, the screen will miss strokes, making my already bad handwriting look even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dWFNI"&gt;Microsoft says it has not seen these issues itself, but I spoke to a number of other reviewers who have been testing the Duo 2 and they all shared my experience. It’s baffling that such a core experience on a touch-based device isn’t flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ9Kgd"&gt;There are other features missing, like tap to wake when the phone is open, or any sort of always-on display. Maybe those features don’t always make sense on the Duo 2’s form factor, but they are just more examples of things you give up, like easy one-handed use, in order to have a device like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9S2zTEJ1pIDldjCQRc7iCZwe60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943428/dseifert_211017_4814_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Duo 2’s new black color option is very glossy and very fingerprint magnet-y.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FSR7Jb"&gt;It’s easy to see the potential in the Surface Duo line. You can dream up all kinds of different ways you’d put two screens to use, get more work done, and live in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BruA6D"&gt;But it doesn’t take long for those dreams to come crashing down to reality. Between the bugs and inherent awkwardness of the form factor, the Duo 2 is just a difficult device to live with day to day, much like its predecessor. Despite Microsoft addressing many of the omissions of the first generation — a proper camera, NFC, dual speakers, 5G, current processor — the Duo 2 still feels like a secondary device, something you carry alongside your primary phone for taking pictures, paying for things, and general phone stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="okKIaA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Duo 2 is far from the one device to rule them all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MGpXYL"&gt;If you do want a futuristic device that straddles the line between phone and tablet and has pen input, you’ll be better off with the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3, which has a better multimedia experience; can be used easier in one hand; and far fewer bugs. Or maybe you just wait, after all, this segment is still very much in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggL8Zm"&gt;At $1,500-plus, everything about the Surface Duo 2 is a tall ask. You could accomplish much of the same with an iPad Mini alongside your phone for a third of the price. If the first Surface Duo felt like it was 50 percent complete, the Duo 2 is perhaps maybe 75 percent of the way there. I can see the potential. But it does not live up to it, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune puts an epic franchise ahead of its epic story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqEf4tj5W94Xiy3nLbQvOJUq_7M=/761x0:3335x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70025198/rev_1_DUN_T2_0050r_High_Res_JPEG.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Warner Bros / Legendary Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation wows with scale and scope but is missing an ending&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="fN16Un"&gt;The most important thing to know about the movie called &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is that it’s not actually “Dune.” As the title card relates from the first seconds of the movie, the film you’re watching (which debuts on HBO Max on October 21st at 6PM ET and in theaters on October 22nd) isn’t &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, but rather &lt;em&gt;Dune: Part One&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a movie that aspires from the start to be more than a single film. It’s the start of a capital F-&lt;em&gt;Franchise&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v95g3v"&gt;To be clear, the movie that director Denis Villeneuve has here is great. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; actually succeeds at translating the oftentimes impenetrable novel into an enjoyable and approachable sci-fi epic at a scale far beyond the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Treks&lt;/em&gt; of yore. The problem is that it feels more like half of an epic. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8L2-HZWV_vD5xfZDWrK5Hgshg3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943079/rev_1_DUN_T2_0039_High_Res_JPEG__1_.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9zRqP6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; (the movie) is based on &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, the classic sci-fi novel from author Frank Herbert. At its core, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Paul Atreides, the son and heir to House Atreides, which is engaged in a complex political power struggle with another house, the villainous Harkonnens. Specifically, everyone is fighting over control of the desert planet Arrakis — the titular “dune” — and the source of the incredibly valuable resource spice, which enables all galactic commerce and travel. Along the way, Paul also stumbles into a greater destiny that could change the face of the galaxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYzzHe"&gt;A key part of its success is lead actor Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, who has to walk the line between coming across as an actual human being with feelings and emotions and the otherworldly, wise-beyond-his-years messiah that Paul is destined to become. Chalamet’s Paul doesn’t want to be the next Duke of House Atreides; he wants to hang out with Jason Momoa’s bro-y Duncan Idaho, skip his classes because he’s not in the mood, and complain about having to attend family functions. It helps to humanize Paul, who otherwise comes across as a know-it-all who gets to be the best at all of Dune’s various quasi-magic techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="twRjO5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; actually succeeds at translating the oftentimes impenetrable novel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TyVFHF"&gt;The rest of the incredibly star-filled cast is great, too, although many A-list actors feel underused in a way that practically screams “they’ll be back in the sequels!” Oscar Isaac gets the most screentime of the relatively minor characters and puts it to good use as the noble, patrician Duke Leto. Isaac exudes a sense of righteous honor, and it’s easy to see both why his men would follow him to a forsaken desert world and why he falls so thoroughly into the political traps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B57zM"&gt;Momoa brings the most levity to the occasionally ponderous film, sauntering from scene to scene with smiles and swagger. But other characters — like Javier Bardem’s Freman leader, Josh Brolin’s surly weapons master, or Dave Bautista’s villainous Rabban — feel more like table setting for the sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPnsRk"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; — at least for this first half — gives less attention to its female leads. Zendaya’s Chani, destined to be Paul’s love interest and partner in the latter half of Herbert’s novel, is relegated to silent, softly lit perfume commercial-style visions for the vast majority of the film. Rebecca Ferguson gets a little more to do as the Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother, but she spends a lot more time in the film worrying over her son and partner than she does as a member of the politically powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wECDDfeJyryHzthq1VL0YhilW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943085/rev_1_DUN_T2_0040r_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vCeRM6"&gt;Women hold positions of power in &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s world, but in &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; the film, they’re largely second to the male leads. That will presumably change if (or when) Villeneuve gets to adapt the second half of the book, which sees Jessica and Chani take larger roles in the story during Paul’s time among the Freman, but right now, it’s more setup than payoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZOEez"&gt;The main exception is Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Liet-Kynes, a gender-swapped version of the book character who is both an Imperial liaison caught between her love of Arrakis and the Freman and her allegiance to the Emperor, who seeks to embroil Kynes in his plots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FMcLs"&gt;The real star of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, though, is the setting and worldbuilding. All of Villeneuve’s modes from previous films like &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; are turned up to 11 here: the ships are starker and more abstract, the buildings more towering and brutalist, the landscapes are more sweeping and desolate, the bass-heavy score from Hans Zimmer even more thunderous. I’m still not sure I buy the argument that Dune (or any film, really) &lt;em&gt;demands&lt;/em&gt; to be seen in a proper theater, but you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve got a good set of speakers handy for however you do watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PG6mJYg_KsjrYqecY1A9UzN8pIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943090/rev_1_DU_21469_Sr_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K03xST"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is a film designed to be seen as epic, with a scope and scale that extends from everything from Paul’s weighty destiny to the sheer size of the iconic sandworms. And it works: when everything is firing on all cylinders, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; overwhelms with visual, thematic, and sonic heft without losing sight of the personal dramas that power those lofty ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1oqo86"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The real star of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, though, is the setting and worldbuilding&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oh0NWt"&gt;Fortunately, Villeneuve wisely skips over a lot of Herbert’s info-dumps and makes some of the more subtle political machinations a little clearer in an effort to streamline and simplify the story. No one in the film says the word “mentat” or explains the concept of the living calculators, for example, but no one really needs to. The result is a film that’s relatively approachable for a &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; adaptation, even for newcomers to the story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eebQaj"&gt;But the biggest problem with &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is that it ends just as the movie is getting started, cutting off not with a big, cathartic ending but somewhere in the middle of the second act of the story. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; leaves you wanting more, but in the sense that you didn’t actually get everything you were promised. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGW5uaGnY5lXALFx9zeYm6HmcdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943087/rev_1_DU_10745rv4_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6ebkjM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; does try to have its cake and eat it, too, in some respects, with Paul’s visions of possible futures filling in for epic Freman battles and &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s galactic stakes. It even tosses a quick shot of someone finally riding a sandworm in the final moments, as if to remind viewers (and studio executives) that the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; fun is coming in the still unconfirmed sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn49jl"&gt;If there is a Dune: Part Two somewhere down the line, there’s going to be the possibility of an hours-long marathon of the two parts of the movie for an experience that rivals the original tome. But for now, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s methodological worldbuilding and table setting is in the same place the movie leaves Paul: primed for greatness, but with a lot of unrealized potential that has yet to be unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thrustmaster’s T248 is a great PS5 racing wheel</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Get ready for Gran Turismo 7&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="VudFdO"&gt;Thrustmaster’s new $399.99 T248 is a force-feedback steering wheel and pedal setup designed for the PS5, PS4, and PC. While it’s not quite as premium as some of the more extreme enthusiast gear out there, it’s intended to be an all-in-one package that gets players started with a good quality racing wheel setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiR7QG"&gt;I’ve been using it for a while in advance of its release today, and I think Thrustmaster has struck an impressive balance between price and performance. If you can fit it into your setup, it’s a great option for PlayStation and PC. (An Xbox-compatible version will also follow later this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dI37ND"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10817247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5DNs7U"&gt;If you’ve never used a force feedback wheel before, it’s hard to overstate how much one can change the experience of playing racing games. A good wheel provides a strong level of resistance and can replicate the effects of the track on your vehicle in granular detail, which heightens both immersion and your understanding of what’s going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KE3aPR"&gt;The most dedicated racing simulator fans use direct-drive wheels, which are essentially full-on car wheels attached directly to bulky motors and usually cost thousands of dollars. Entry-level wheels, meanwhile, rely on more conventional gears and rumble motors. Thrustmaster’s “Hybrid Drive” system sits somewhere between the two, using belts and pulleys to provide force feedback; the company says the T248 is the only wheel in its price range to use a belt in its design like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLCtLn"&gt;The T248 also stands apart by integrating an LCD screen into the wheel itself. Depending on the game, this can display information like lap info, speed, your position, and more, or device-specific settings such as the type of force feedback and the angle of the wheel. It’s not something I found myself spending a lot of time looking at — it is generally a bad idea to look away from the actual screen when you’re playing a racing game — but it does add a nice touch of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYYdQX"&gt;The T248 is easy enough to hook up to your PlayStation or PC. It does require an external power supply, but otherwise it’s simply a matter of connecting the pedals to the wheel and then a single USB cable to your gaming machine. (You do need to download a driver on PC.) It has all the buttons you’d expect on a PS5 controller, so you can navigate menus and so on with ease. One thing to watch for is that it’ll calibrate itself by quickly spinning the wheel back and forth when you turn your hardware on, which could be alarming if you’re not expecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qDg7O4NffRZm-d1X7LharV0V_Dw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941549/DSCF7781.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUwkwf"&gt;Another thing you might not expect is the potential difficulty of actually getting all the equipment in place. The wheel comes with a clamp system that is relatively easy to attach to a desk or table, but you’re likely to find that your existing furniture isn’t at the ideal height or placement for a comfortable position. In my living room, for example, I have a coffee table pulled close to the sofa, so if I make room for the pedals I have to push the table back and hunch over the wheel to reach it. The setup worked better in my office with my PC as I could just put the pedals under the desk, but that made me wish for wheel locks on my chair because slamming the brakes sometimes ended up pushing me backward across the hard floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zxeGV"&gt;None of this is news to racing game enthusiasts, of course, which is why they often go for more elaborate setups involving screwing the wheels and pedals into a dedicated cockpit-style frame. These can be relatively accessible and inexpensive, but obviously it’s more of a space commitment than attaching a wheel to an existing desk. As the T248 is a product intended to give first-time users a good out-of-the-box experience, it’s worth noting that you may need to make a few more adjustments yourself than what Thrustmaster is able to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNnXgk"&gt;Once you’re set up and comfortable, though, the T248 is great. I played it with a wide variety of racing games, from arcade-y titles like &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;, to more realistic releases like &lt;em&gt;F1 2020&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Assetto Corsa&lt;/em&gt;, and it makes each and every one of them feel like completely different games compared to the experience you get with a regular controller. You have a much better sense of when your car might slip out of control or when you ought to start accelerating out of a corner. Even a comparatively niche game like &lt;em&gt;MudRunner —&lt;/em&gt; which involves plowing heavy Soviet vehicles through challenging off-road environments — is transformed into a fight against the machinery and the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYpdLk"&gt;While you’re not going to get the level of feedback of an expensive direct-drive setup, this is far more convincing and realistic than the lower-end wheels I’ve used. It also just feels more premium, with a leathery finish over foam surrounding the wheel itself. There isn’t a gear stick included, but the magnetic shifter paddles behind the wheel are satisfyingly clicky. The pedals also feel very substantial, including one for the clutch as well as the accelerator and brake, and you can adjust their level of resistance by swapping out the springs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ooxje05-sO-7cuPhwRZ0FRQ_pIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22941550/DSCF7778.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n9dZ2j"&gt;You don’t strictly need a racing wheel to play racing games, just as you don’t need a flight stick for flight simulators or a fighting stick for fighters. But as with those genres, a dedicated controller should be considered essential for budding enthusiasts. If you’re a beginner who’s serious about the idea — or just really hyped for &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5 —&lt;/em&gt; the T248 is a great way to get started. For a game controller, $399 isn’t exactly impulse-buy territory, but I think you get good value for what this package is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JedOCQ"&gt;The one thing to know is that it does require a slight commitment. You’ll either want to be sure it can work in your living environment already or prepare to construct a full-on driving rig in your basement. The T248 has spent most of its time attached to the desk in my office, and it’s been a blast. But if I had the space for a frame, well, that would be a whole new rabbit hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkxLdu"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PlayStation- and PC-compatible Thrustmaster T248 is available today. An Xbox- and PC-compatible version will follow this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raspberry Pi temporarily increases Pi 4 price in response to chip shortages </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuLcX0x-d7ugcyloSbJ1WIs0mE4=/0x2:1200x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70024810/EZFf0mwWAAEfTyI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raspberry Pi 4.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Raspberry Pi Foundation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5DECKM"&gt;In response to supply chain issues, particularly around semiconductors, Raspberry Pi is increasing the price of the version of the Raspberry Pi 4 sold with 2GB of RAM. The increase, which &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-shortages-and-our-first-ever-price-increase/"&gt;CEO Eben Upton says&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s first ever, will see the Pi 4 2GB’s price rise by $10 from $35 to $45. To serve the needs of customers on tighter budgets, the company is reintroducing the 1GB Pi 4 for $35, which was discontinued last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zppraf"&gt;“These changes in pricing are not here to stay,” Upton writes. “As global supply chain issues moderate, we’ll keep revisiting this issue, and we want to get pricing back to where it was as fast as we can.” Upton said supply chain challenges are likely to continue through next year, echoing the predictions of larger companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358256/apple-supplier-foxconn-parts-shortages-chips-2022"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;, but added that the company sees “early signs that the supply chain situation is starting to ease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1U00or"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to get pricing back to where it was as fast as we can”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7HO7Wb"&gt;It’s a significant price increase of over 25 percent for the 2GB Pi 4, a computer prized for its affordability, that could have a big impact on the industrial customers that use Raspberry Pis. Upton says that although the world appears to be slowly emerging from the pandemic, semiconductors continue to be in high demand thanks to companies panic buying components to ensure they have enough to meet their own demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cW7rcZ"&gt;The changes effectively revert the price drop Raspberry Pi &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/new-price-raspberry-pi-4-2gb/"&gt;introduced in February last year&lt;/a&gt; in response to falling RAM prices. It came just weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic began to upend demand for, and the supply of, consumer technology. Since then everyone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;games console and graphics card manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;automakers&lt;/a&gt; has had to grapple with shortages of key components, limiting their ability to produce enough products to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvfMoh"&gt;Raspberry Pi adds that it’s deprioritizing production of the the Raspberry Pi 3B Plus, and is advising customers who rely on this model to migrate to the 1GB Pi 4 if they want to ensure uninterrupted availability. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where is Google’s foldable phone? Everything we know so far </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HTInjXG9qVRU8taeyzbIVu5_ZnQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70024755/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaks indicate the Pixel Fold may resemble the  Samsung Galaxy Z Flip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRr0gg"&gt;During the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;“Pixel Fall Launch” event&lt;/a&gt;, Google formally launched the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro as well as its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22725981/google-pixel-pass-subscription-services-phone-monthly-payments-price"&gt;Pixel Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, however, the tech giant didn’t divulge much more about other new products — like Google’s first folding phone. Google &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-is-already-working-on-a-foldable-pixel-phone/"&gt;previously confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 it’s working on prototyping foldable device technology, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266257/google-folding-bending-screen-display-patent"&gt;applied for patents&lt;/a&gt; on foldable screens, and we’ve since reported on a number of leaks suggesting the Pixel Fold might arrive as soon as this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ceYdn"&gt;For example, Korean industry site &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested Samsung was going to produce folding OLED panels for the device this very month — and that’s just one of many recent leaks. Here’s a catch-up on everything else we think we know about the Pixel Fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RuV9Ed"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have big screens, big ambitions, and small prices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"},{"title":"Spec showdown: Google’s new Pixel 6 vs. Samsung, Apple, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735208/google-pixel-6-pro-spec-comparison-iphone-samsung-oneplus-camera-battery-screen-size"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="VcgcYY"&gt;The Pixel Fold was rumored to launch by the end of 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="gRtTh2"&gt;Internal documents from 2020 suggest a “Passport,” a name used internally for one of the Pixel Fold designs, would launch during the fourth quarter of 2021. That’s a prediction that was repeated by &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;TheElec&lt;/a&gt; in mid-2021, as well as reliable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1439827216343474176"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; in September. That’s why some predicted Google would show off the Pixel Fold during the “Pixel Fall Launch” event, which obviously it didn’t. Of course, we still have a little over two months left of 2021, so there’s still a possibility of seeing it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qnuAvp9VAnbHVF1G90L5WIMmyVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942258/Screen_Shot_2021_10_20_at_9.22.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Patentscope&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram from Google’s 2019 patent application filing was one of the earliest reports suggesting it’s experimenting with foldable device tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="CuJyk0"&gt;Google apparently has two potential foldable designs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IO8QoX"&gt;The public first found out about &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/08/05/google-pixel-foldable-leaked-document/"&gt;the “Passport” codename&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020 after leaked internal documents referred to the device accordingly. That was the only Pixel Fold we’d heard of for over a year, and the one that would supposedly launch in 2021. In September 2021, however, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s sources&lt;/a&gt; reported Google is also testing a second foldable Pixel smartphone dubbed “Jumbojack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmvFFu"&gt;We don’t know when this second device will be released, if ever. In fact, we don’t know whether the “Jumboback” is a second type of Pixel foldable device, or an internal prototype Google is using to build out foldable phone features. What we do know, however, is that both seem different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EeGmOV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: flipping into the mainstream","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"},{"title":"Samsung will now let you design your own Galaxy Z Flip 3","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22735494/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-bespoke-edition-design-unpacked-2"},{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="2j409L"&gt;One folds more like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip, the other like the Z Fold&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ofphy"&gt;There’s some speculation the “Jumboback” codename name is &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;a reference&lt;/a&gt; to Jack in the Box’s Jumbo Jack cheeseburger. This implies the phone may fold “hamburger style” like a powder case, as Samsung’s Z Flip does. That differs from the Passport’s alleged “hotdog” style, which folds like a passport similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Jumboback” may fold in this Samsung Z Flip’s “hamburger” style.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x8h412"&gt;Interestingly, the “Passport” design’s folding display might even have the same screen size as Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3. A June 2021 report from &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicates the phone could come with a 7.6-inch folding display panel that folds inward. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Passport” design, meanwhile, may fold like the Samsung Z Fold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="QsOX57"&gt;Samsung could produce its OLED panels and may own a part of the Fold’s screen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="B6S9IJ"&gt;That same report from &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2898"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheElec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also suggests Samsung would start producing folding OLED panels in October for the “Passport” device. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;may also&lt;/a&gt; use Samsung’s proprietary ultra-thin cover glass, which is bendable (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;and is technically produced by Schott&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18071720/google-android-foldables-fragmentation-displays"&gt;Samsung worked closely with Google&lt;/a&gt; to support foldable screens in Android to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="r7L7xS"&gt;The Fold may come with a new foldable-friendly version of Android — might that delay its launch date?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="KA6bn7"&gt;In September 2021, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/18/pixel-fold-jumbojack-android-12-1/"&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/a&gt; sources revealed the Jumbojack foldable device due to references in a future version of the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says could be Android 12.1. Incidentally, Android 12.1 is an update that may also offer several foldable-focused improvements, an analysis of leaked code by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-1-hands-on/"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaaHhG"&gt;According to the publication, these Android 12.1 enhancements include a better split-screen UI and a new taskbar to easily access and use multiple apps using both screens simultaneously. The lock screen could also make better use of horizontal space, showing, for example, notifications on one side and the clock on the other, while placing Quick Settings and notifications panels side-by-side. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8pOA7CobN5Kt2tkQIjgSrHw6jQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899747/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 launched on October 19th and offers more design customization options. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zo7OyB"&gt;Will the Pixel Fold, or at least the Jumboback, need to wait to launch until Android 12.1 is ready. Is that why we have yet to see the Pixel Fold? Android 12 only just released, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
