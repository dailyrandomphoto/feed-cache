    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s 1.05 update addresses a laundry list of bugs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZkVpMSOabIVxyXX2I2EYMi3_VU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551568/screen_gotta_know_where_to_look_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OrxH0m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s second promised hotfix is out for Xbox and PlayStation platforms. The PC version will follow “soon,” according to developer CD Projekt Red. You can read the extensive list of &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37166/hotfix-1-05"&gt;fixes here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Trvpmn"&gt;While there doesn’t seem to be anything quite as significant as the changes to reduce epilepsy risk made in last week’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;1.04 hotfix&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully this new update will make what has been a very buggy game have a few less issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRawXT"&gt;The game has been out for a little more than a week, and players have been criticizing the game for its numerous bugs and performance issues, &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2077-cyberpunk-2077-how-bad-is-last-gen-performance-and-can-it-be-improved"&gt;particularly on older consoles&lt;/a&gt;. The outcry led to Sony offering full refunds of digital copies of the game and taking the unprecedented step of yanking the game from the PlayStation Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;Thursday night&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, the game has not returned to Sony’s storefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNdap9"&gt;Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;offering refunds&lt;/a&gt; for digital versions, though the game remains available for digital purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189322/cyberpunk-2077-refund-cd-projekt-red-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;CD Projekt Red has also vowed&lt;/a&gt; to pay for refunds for retail purchases of the game “out of our own pocket if necessary” if players submit refund requests by December 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4CKWO"&gt;CD Projekt Red &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1338390123373801472"&gt;has committed&lt;/a&gt; to releasing two larger patches to help the game run better in January and February. “Together these should fix the most prominent problems gamers are facing on last-gen consoles,” according to the studio.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Members of the US Space Force will now be called ‘Guardians’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xRp7xycT_6f3l_4rg9VKepM42ek=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551473/SpaceForce_Guardians.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: United States Space Force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bmbVn3"&gt;Members of the United States Space Force &lt;a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article/2452593/us-space-force-unveils-name-of-space-professionals/"&gt;will officially be called “Guardians”&lt;/a&gt;, according to an announcement Vice President Mike Pence made at an event celebrating the military branch’s one year anniversary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2xnYN"&gt;The organization traces the name “Guardians” back to an old Air Force Space Command motto from 1983, “Guardians of the High Frontier,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article/2452593/us-space-force-unveils-name-of-space-professionals/"&gt;a short post on the US Space Force website&lt;/a&gt;. While a distinct entity, Space Force is part of the Air Force per its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21004914/space-force-military-branch-ndaa-2020-joint-chiefs"&gt;establishment with the National Defense Authorization Act&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rbBF39"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LR2xlbRe6po?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=4946&amp;amp;start=4946" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frwqxV"&gt;As it exists today, Space Force is mostly a rebrand of Air Force Space Command, but with the authority to make decisions independent from the Air Force. Space Force personnel also mostly come from the Air Force, but there’s been notable transfers — &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/astronaut-mike-hopkins-space-force-7891a73d-33a8-4b3f-8437-72f502ecce37.html"&gt;like astronaut Mike Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; — who’ve joined from other government organizations. Unlike Hopkins’ former employer NASA, Space Force is less concerned with exploring space, than it is controlling it and protecting American assets like satellites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kw7Qw"&gt;Choosing “Guardians” as an official name comes with some unavoidable (and maybe intended) pop culture associations. There’s Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15394108/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-review-chris-pratt-marvel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy &lt;/em&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced Marvel film fans to the “cosmic” side of the Marvel universe. And from the world of video games, Guardians also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/5/16253052/destiny-2-launch-gameplay-preview-impressions"&gt;show up again in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as undead warriors charged with defending the Last City on Earth from alien enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PMhtM"&gt;This wouldn’t be the first time that Space Force appeared to be cribbing from pop culture, either. When the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21080812/space-force-new-logo-donald-trump-reveal-design-star-trek"&gt;revealed the official logo&lt;/a&gt;, many pointed out its similarities to the Starfleet emblem used in the television show &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. The US Space Force later attempted to clarify that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335338/united-states-space-force-star-trek-delta-symbol-air-force-space-command"&gt;inspired by older Air Force Space Command logos&lt;/a&gt; rather than the hit series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GGSPDx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh wow. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uiJfOS1L1H"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uiJfOS1L1H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Miriam Kramer (@mirikramer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mirikramer/status/1220822476621598720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ppwkzC"&gt;Whatever the source of the name, you can count on Space Force being a lot more mundane than any of the pop culture we associate with it. It may be a bit of a branding exercise to satisfy the President, but the Biden administration appears to have &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/biden-likely-to-stay-course-on-space-force-and-defense-investments/"&gt;no plans to change course&lt;/a&gt;. With Space Force and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700565/nasa-artemis-moon-return-landing-trump-administration-jim-bridenstine"&gt;recent work to return to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, the US is focusing even more on space heading into the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgeFq3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqvnvi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVyuG3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moderna COVID-19 vaccine second to get FDA sign-off in US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Illustration Of Moderna Logo With A Syringe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skJAj8q3qyZFagq2G96SndVcoNg=/0x0:5400x3600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551451/1230124131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JSv9D8"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna, which joins the Pfizer and BioNTech product as the second shot available for use in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuLAx6"&gt;The vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144636/download"&gt;can now&lt;/a&gt; be given to adults 18 years of age and older in the US. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726554/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-pfizer-biontech"&gt;94 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; against symptomatic COVID-19 in clinical trials. The Moderna vaccine also protects against cases of severe disease: there were 30 cases of severe disease among trial participants, and all were in the placebo group. Initial data on the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine also indicated that it could protect against severe disease, but data was &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-is-first-to-win-u-s-authorization/"&gt;too limited&lt;/a&gt; to reach a definite conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XX15W"&gt;“With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwPZ07"&gt;Data presented by Moderna also hints that the vaccine might be able to prevent asymptomatic infection with COVID-19, not just symptomatic disease. In the clinical trial, the company tested every participant for the coronavirus between the first dose and second dose of the vaccine. There were 38 cases without symptoms in the placebo group and 14 in the vaccination group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w21gv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Moderna vaccine has less onerous storage requirements than the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UCkqk6"&gt;Like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine was made using a gene-based technology. It contains a snippet of the genetic material for the coronavirus spike protein. The snippet instructs the body to build copies of that protein and use those copies to train the immune system to recognize and attack the actual virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSMNo1"&gt;Also like the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine will be available under an Emergency Use Authorization, a designation that lets the FDA sign off on products faster than the normal review process during an emergency like a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6BNKt"&gt;The Moderna vaccine has less onerous storage requirements than the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, which has to be kept at ultracold temperatures — covered in dry ice or in specialized freezers — until it’s ready to be used. Moderna’s can be stored in a refrigerator for &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-longer-shelf-life-its-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;up to 30 days&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to distribute to places without the infrastructure to maintain an ultracold environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiNyf8"&gt;“We remain focused on scaling up manufacturing to help us protect as many people as we can from this terrible disease,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-fda-authorization-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-us"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5aTDz"&gt;The United States ordered &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-shot-supply-rocks-u-s-taps-option-to-secure-100m-more-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-doses"&gt;200 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of the Moderna vaccine, enough to vaccinate 100 million people. The first doses will be distributed to health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities within days. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google now offers weekly COVID-19 tests to every US employee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4c-ecOnEv26bQgQTm0cCO4rbo0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551383/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oLkkxw"&gt;90,000 Google employees have just received access to free weekly COVID tests. The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-new-perk-free-weekly-covid-19-testing-for-employees-11608328652"&gt;first reported the news&lt;/a&gt; that every US Google employee (and its subsidiaries, including YouTube) will be eligible to sign up for a free at-home test. This differs from other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/15/amazon-encourages-california-workers-to-get-weekly-covid-tests.html"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which are only offering tests to employees who still have to work in a physical location, like a retail location or warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pz7dNI"&gt;This is apparently something Google employees are interested in, as the vendor’s website crashed after going live. Employees are promised that they’ll receive the test within two to four days of requesting one, and that they’ll get the results back within two days of the lab receiving it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hskzr5"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report, Google is paying its partner, BioIQ, $50 per test. That comes out to $4.5 million per week when multiplied by 90,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SE3Dk0"&gt;Of course, the $4.5 million figure is assuming that every employee takes advantage of the offer, though a Google spokesperson said the company is recommending they do. It’s also a very small cost relative to Google’s profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQIhII"&gt;Google’s spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that interns will be eligible for the program as well, and that it should be expanding to international employees in 2021. The company is hoping that the testing will help reduce the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445706/coronavirus-cdc-test-guidelines-covid-19-asymptomatic-trump"&gt;asymptomatic spreaders&lt;/a&gt; should any of its employees become infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSy78L"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/15/21180370/google-testing-website-coronavirus-trump-covid-19-confusion"&gt;President Trump claimed&lt;/a&gt; that Google would create a website and nationwide system for getting access to COVID tests. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19"&gt;That was not true&lt;/a&gt;, although an Alphabet division did briefly offer testing in some regions. Google has done other work for the public like creating a contact tracing system with Apple and improving the information it shows on its search results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vri7FB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The original version of this story said that it was a Google site that crashed under the load. It was BioIQ’s site. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shigeru Miyamoto tours Super Nintendo World theme park in new video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9DxPa4-ZbtR0KPrOHzLL053XmQ=/158x0:1583x950/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551221/Screen_Shot_2020_12_18_at_3.25.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iZB6In"&gt;Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto led a video tour of the company’s Mario-themed Super Nintendo World attraction at Universal Studios Japan in Osaka during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQaRBOI-9kg"&gt;latest Direct livestream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3k0oy"&gt;The theme park looks to be packed with Mario iconography that will be familiar to Nintendo fans. Even the entrance Mario-themed: you enter the park by walking through a giant pipe that spits you out in the atrium of Princess Peach’s castle that first debuted in &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDUVFU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A smart wristband lets you interact with elements of the park&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3s64K"&gt;Miyamoto showed how you can you use a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21064777/super-nintendo-world-mario-theme-park-osaka-japan-wristbands-mobile-app"&gt;special smart wristband&lt;/a&gt;, called the “Power-Up Band,” to interact with different parts of the zone. In one example, he punched a question mark block with the hand wearing the device, and the block made the classic Mario coin-collecting sound. In another moment, Miyamoto hit a POW block near a spinning Koopa shell at the right time to make it bounce up and collect a key coin. The band links to your smartphone so you can track your activities around the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Vf72Y"&gt;Miyamoto also walked through an underground area that had oversized elements to create the illusion of being a smaller Mario, a vast cafe with video screens of Toads making food, and Bowser’s Castle, which is where the AR &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;-themed roller coaster is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XI3Shp"&gt;As a long-time Mario fan, the park looks delightful, and I hope I can experience it for myself someday. Super Nintendo World is scheduled to open &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726093/super-nintendo-world-osaka-japan-opening-date-announced"&gt;on February 4th&lt;/a&gt;. The zone was originally set to open before the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but the opening &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306781/super-nintendo-world-opening-delayed-indefinitely-coronavirus"&gt;was delayed&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic (which also pushed back the Olympics). At some point, Universal Studios also plans to open Super Nintendo World zones in Hollywood, California; Orlando, Florida; and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Facebook bug exposed Instagram users’ personal email addresses and birthdays</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BUiIHc"&gt;When signing up for an Instagram account, the service promises that your email and birthday won’t be publicly visible. A bug discovered by security researcher Saugat Pokharel, however, made it so that an attacker could easily get that private information. The bug, which was patched after being reported to Facebook, was exploitable by business accounts that were given access to an experimental feature the company was testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qoi1mI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The attack worked on private accounts, and ones that don’t accept public DMs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0E00Zu"&gt;The attack used Facebook’s Business Suite tool, available to any Facebook business account. The experimental upgrade meant that if a Facebook business account was linked to Instagram and was included in the test group, the Business Suite tool would show additional information about a person alongside any direct message — including their supposedly private email address and birthday. All business users had to do was send a direct message on Instagram to call up the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zMPbB"&gt;Pokharel found that the attack worked on accounts that were set to private and accounts that were set to not accept DMs from the public. If an account did not accept DMs, the user potentially would not receive any notification indicating their profile may have been viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs53HU"&gt;An experienced bug hunter, Pokharel also discovered that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368602/instagram-kept-deleted-photos-messages-on-servers-year-bug-fixed"&gt;wasn’t actually deleting deleted posts&lt;/a&gt; back in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTN7La"&gt;In a statement provided to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Facebook spokesperson said that the bug was only accessible for a short period of time, as the experiment was started in October. The company doesn’t disclose how many users were given access to the feature, but it says that it was a “small test,” and that an investigation found no evidence of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYWByA"&gt;The full text of the statement is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nCejhA"&gt; A researcher reported an issue where, if someone was a part of a small test we ran in October for business accounts, personal information of the person they were messaging could have been revealed. This issue was resolved quickly, and we discovered no evidence of abuse. Through our Bug Bounty Program we rewarded this researcher for his help in reporting this issue to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4qDXVF"&gt;According to Pokharel, Facebook engineers fixed the issue within a few hours of being notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIExn1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 18, 6:20 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified a point in the second paragraph that only accounts that were included in the experiment had access to the information.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra will have six cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncHc-NQdnFXhEsi3BDMXZvmm9qU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551093/41821.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: WinFuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gl5Wyo"&gt;Today, we have another Galaxy S21 leak, which seems to confirm some of the specs that have been floating around, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;Information about&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187074/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaked-colors-plus-ultra"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S21-series phones have been landing almost daily in the run-up to Samsung’s January event. With this newest leak, we now have a better idea of what to expect — especially in the camera department. In short, the hardware appears to be a big part of Samsung’s plan to take on the highly capable iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEPWZl"&gt;The S21 Ultra will reportedly offer 3x &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; 10x telephoto cameras (72mm and 240mm equivalent focal lengths, respectively), both with optical image stabilization. That’s one additional rear-facing camera compared to the S20 Ultra’s three rear sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dd4YyGk5Sl73FJRSV1V7y9LOCSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183371/41804.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: WinFuture&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SPua0d"&gt;The S21’s 10x lens will use a folded optic design like that of the S20’s telephoto camera. We expect that Samsung will once again offer hybrid zoom that reaches much farther than that 10x optical range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSy8aS"&gt;Some other subtle camera updates look to be on the way, too. The main 108-megapixel camera gets a slightly wider 24mm (versus 26mm) equivalent lens. It will also get laser-assisted autofocus: something that the S20 Ultra didn’t offer but the Note 20 Ultra later introduced. And &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; says that despite the main camera sensor’s on-paper similarities to the last generation, this is a new sensor that should offer better image quality than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF4xl8"&gt;Samsung will need every advantage to compete with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;which we think is the best smartphone camera&lt;/a&gt; on the market today. Historically, Samsung has taken more of a hardware-heavy approach to mobile imaging, increasingly using its own house-made sensors rather than grabbing Sony’s off the shelf, and being early to adopt dual- and triple-lens cameras on its devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whdfag"&gt;Part of the reason Samsung has leaned so hard into advanced hardware is that its computational photography hasn’t kept up with either Apple or Google. Only recently has it come up to par with features like Night Mode. But now it’s another year, and there’s more work to be done to catch up to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWQk7y"&gt;Video may prove to be grounds for Samsung to level the playing field with Apple, too. It’s one area where software can only do so much without the right hardware behind it. Samsung has usually had big specs to tout when it comes to video — the S21 Ultra will offer 8K recording to the 12 Pro Max’s 4K — but the proof will be in the footage. Samsung &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences/"&gt;says it’s committed&lt;/a&gt; to continuing to push its capabilities in this area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jMtF32"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra review: shutter bug","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21155012/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-5g-screen-camera-space-zoom-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pXwHna"&gt;There are a few notable non-camera-related details in &lt;em&gt;WinFuture’s&lt;/em&gt; report. These specs confirm a 6.8-inch display with variable refresh rates from one to 120Hz, a battery-saving move also adopted from the Note 20 Ultra. There’s also S Pen support, which will be sold separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGNcHv"&gt;Samsung will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;follow Apple’s lead&lt;/a&gt; by shipping the S21 devices without wall chargers in the box. The company will probably, like Apple, cite the environmental benefits as the motivation for this change, though cynics among us will note that it’s also beneficial to each company’s bottom line. But the reduction of e-waste is no doubt a good thing, and Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"&gt;use of USB-C rather than a proprietary connector&lt;/a&gt; scores it even more environmental bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWjQAx"&gt;There’s no confirmed launch date or pricing yet for the S21 Ultra, though reports point to an announcement on January 14th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA and Boeing manipulated 737 Max tests during recertification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FAA Chief Steve Dickson Pilots Boeing 737 MAX Test Flight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01XhNQXv5ndHZ0DScWj_TT19hOU=/0x64:4478x3049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551030/1228808006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mike Siegel / Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NynK0y"&gt;Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) worked together to manipulate 737 Max recertification tests following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/12/wicker-releases-committee-s-faa-investigation-report"&gt;damning new Senate report&lt;/a&gt;. Boeing “inappropriately coached” some FAA test pilots to reach a desired outcome during the recertification tests, and some were even performed on simulators that weren’t equipped to re-create the same conditions as the crashes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdcqOQ"&gt;In doing this, the Senate report’s authors say the “FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 MAX tragedies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DrP7Ef"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA is also accused of retaliating against whistleblowers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BNgmvJ"&gt;The FAA is also accused of retaliating against whistleblowers, possibly obstructing the Office of the Inspector General’s investigation into the crashes, failing to hold senior managers accountable, and allowing Southwest Airlines to operate dozens of improperly certified planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tcIAJ"&gt;The 102-page report, released Friday, was compiled by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and is built on information from 50 whistleblowers, FAA staff interviews, and more than 15,000 pages of documents. It comes one month after the FAA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573113/boeing-737-max-cleared-fly-grounding-faa-crashes"&gt;cleared the 737 Max to return to flight&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165956/boeing-737-max-flight-brazil-gol-airlines"&gt;airlines around the world&lt;/a&gt; start &lt;a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/united-to-return-boeing-737-max-to-service-on-11-february/141683.article"&gt;reintroducing the plane into their fleets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcLF09"&gt;While Boeing’s own failures leading up to the 737 Max crashes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21059420/boeing-employees-messages-737-max-investigation-simulator-crash"&gt;have been thoroughly probed and well-documented&lt;/a&gt;, the new Senate report is one of the most intimate looks at problems inside the regulator that was supposed to keep the company in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHu9Q9"&gt;“Our findings are troubling,” Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), who chairs the committee, said in a statement. “The report details a number of significant examples of lapses in aviation safety oversight and failed leadership in the FAA. It is clear that the agency requires consistent oversight to ensure their work to protect the flying public is executed fully and correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtctUc"&gt;In a statement, the FAA said it is, “carefully reviewing the document, which the Committee acknowledges contains a number of unsubstantiated allegations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEE29n"&gt;“Working closely with other international regulators, the FAA conducted a thorough and deliberate review of the 737 MAX,” the FAA’s statement continued. “We are confident that the safety issues that played a role in the tragic accidents involving Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have been addressed through the design changes required and independently approved by the FAA and its partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3mRma"&gt;Boeing said &lt;a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130790"&gt;in a prepared statement&lt;/a&gt; that it “take[s] seriously the Committee’s findings and will continue to review the report in full.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4yrvW"&gt;“Boeing is committed to improving aviation safety, strengthening our safety culture, and rebuilding trust with our customers, regulators, and the flying public,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgsRqt"&gt;“We are aware of the Committee report and have utilized many of these past references to improve our practices and oversight,” a Southwest Airlines spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtMQ97"&gt;“All applicable aircraft underwent visual inspections, and Southwest completed physical inspections, from nose to tail, on each of the pre-owned aircraft by January 2020 — fully satisfying FAA requests,” Southwest’s statement continued. “Our actions did not stem from any suspected Safety concerns with the aircraft but were an effort to reconcile and validate records and previous repairs.” The company has “no changes” to its plans to return the 737 Max to service in the first quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XLeRsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 737 Max was rushed through development so Boeing could keep pace with rival Airbus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xF8slS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PDDSK"&gt;The 737 Max was rushed through development so Boeing could keep pace with rival Airbus, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18518176/boeing-737-max-crash-problems-human-error-mcas-faa"&gt;surprise-announced a more fuel-efficient plane in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of developing a new plane from the ground up, Boeing modified the 737 NG with bigger, more fuel-efficient engines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2CzRW"&gt;The placement of those engines made the plane susceptible to stalls in certain takeoff situations, though, so Boeing equipped the plane with a piece of software that would automatically pitch the nose down to prevent this from happening. Boeing didn’t tell regulators or customers about the software, though, in a bid to cut down on costly flight training. This left the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019 fighting, and ultimately losing out to, a piece of software they didn’t know was working against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCIcFA"&gt;That software, known as Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was a big focus of the recertification tests following the two crashes, especially in simulators meant to recreate the crash conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFgXmv"&gt;The problem, broadly, that the Commerce Committee found was that this testing process was rife with its own problems. Some FAA investigators left tests early, while others were performed in simulators that weren’t equipped with the same software that doomed the 737 Max flights, meaning the results were meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71SG9S"&gt;In one particular FAA test performed on the right simulator, a whistleblower says Boeing officials were present and told the test pilots when to hit the switch that killed MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVSJqI"&gt;When these actions were reported by whistleblowers, they were often ignored or retaliated against, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClRtUx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 18th, 8:11PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement and information the FAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China-based Zoom employee charged for secretly censoring Tiananmen Square anniversary events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UauYzuRYy-Nav1zLJBrg0tYizN0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68551028/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xmx7VW"&gt;A China-based former Zoom employee is being charged with harassment for allegedly disrupting video calls commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Brooklyn federal prosecutors &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/china-based-executive-us-telecommunications-company-charged-disrupting-video-meetings"&gt;unsealed a case&lt;/a&gt; against Xinjiang (also known as Julien) Jin today. The complaint doesn’t identify Jin’s employer, but Zoom &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/our-perspective-on-the-doj-complaint/"&gt;published a blog post&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging that it employed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOPrbs"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/press-release/file/1346966/download"&gt;the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, Jin was a liaison between Zoom and Chinese law enforcement and intelligence services. He allegedly used this position to target dissidents and activists both inside and outside the People’s Republic of China, collecting account information and disrupting meetings. “The allegations in the complaint lay bare the Faustian bargain that the PRC government demands of U.S. technology companies doing business within the PRC’s borders, and the insider threat that those companies face from their own employees in the PRC,” said acting US attorney Seth D. DuCharme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TsoaId"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Jin allegedly got meetings banned by reporting “disgusting pics” from fake accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AV1Oxe"&gt;While serving as a “security technical leader” at Zoom, Jin allegedly identified users who discussed “disfavorable” political and religious topics, then worked with other employees to stop these users from participating in calls. As the 31st anniversary of the protests approached, the complaint says, he asked US-based employees to provide account information about dissidents planning to commemorate the events. Chinese authorities subsequently detained potential participants inside China and in at least one case, it threatened the family of a participant living abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTGhdn"&gt;Most dramatically, Jin reportedly led a conspiracy to get Tiananmen Square-related events and their participants banned for violating Zoom’s terms of service. A group of employees allegedly set up accounts under false names using profile pictures with terrorism-related or pornographic imagery. Then they infiltrated Zoom event rooms and reported the meetings for hosting “disgusting pics,” “child abuse,” and content “inciting violence” — based on images from their own fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr48Wk"&gt;Zoom &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/improving-our-policies-as-we-continue-to-enable-global-collaboration/"&gt;apologized earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for terminating public commemorative events and the accounts of their hosts. At that point, it said it shut down the meetings because they had a large number of participants from mainland China, and Chinese authorities had called the events unlawful. “Going forward Zoom will not allow requests from the Chinese government to impact anyone outside of mainland China,” the company promised. An update to the post acknowledged that at least one session was terminated due to “an apparent terms of service violation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu0J6x"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/our-perspective-on-the-doj-complaint/"&gt;In a post&lt;/a&gt; following the unsealing, Zoom said it had cooperated with the Department of Justice and launched its own internal probe, resulting in Jin being terminated and other unnamed employees placed on leave while the investigation concludes. Zoom says it appointed Jin after the Chinese government abruptly terminated its service and demanded it comply with local censorship laws. “The shutdown put Zoom in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable position,” the post reads. “As we worked to resolve the shutdown, China requested that Zoom confirm it would comply with Chinese law, including designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR4b5n"&gt;Jin is charged with conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and unlawful conspiracy to transfer means of identification, based on his alleged impersonation of Zoom users. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, but the Department of Justice says that Jin has not been taken into custody.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn tells Wisconsin it never promised to build an LCD factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man walks past an office building with the Foxconn name displayed outside on Wednesday, May 8 2019 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYeysa"&gt;In October, Wisconsin denied Foxconn subsidies because it had failed to build the LCD factory specified in its contract with the state. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported, it had created a building one-twentieth the size of the promised factory, taken out a permit to use it for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526765/foxconn-lcd-factory-not-real-confirmation-wisconsin-report-exclusive"&gt;storage&lt;/a&gt;, and failed to employ anywhere near the number of employees the contract called for. Nevertheless, Foxconn publicly objected “on numerous grounds” to Wisconsin’s denial of subsidies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1qW83"&gt;Documents obtained through a records request show Foxconn’s rationale: it doesn’t think it was specifically promising to build an LCD factory at all. According to a November 23rd letter to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), Foxconn does not think the factory specified in the contract, an enormous Generation 10.5 LCD fabrication facility, was actually a “material” part of the contract. (“Material” is a legal term that means relevant or significant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IKddr"&gt;“As you confirmed on November 10, 2020, the only reason the WEDC made the determination that the Recipients are ineligible for tax credits is because the WEDC believes the Recipients have failed to carry out the ‘Project,’” Foxconn wrote. “Thus, WEDC’s determination of ineligibility is based off its belief that the Generation 10.5 TFT-LCD Fabrication Facility is a material term of the Agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aTlSJp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Thus, WEDC’s determination of ineligibility is based off its belief that the Generation 10.5 TFT-LCD Fabrication Facility is a material term of the Agreement.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="npuOdN"&gt;Rather, Foxconn claimed it and WEDC had a “mutual understanding” that it would build something more vaguely defined, “a transformational and sustainable high-tech manufacturing and technology ecosystem in Wisconsin that brings long-term investment and jobs.” However, Foxconn did express openness to amending its contract to allow for more flexibility in what it was building in exchange for lower subsidies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CBrHM"&gt;Foxconn’s letter was written in response to repeated requests from WEDC to explain why exactly Foxconn was objecting to WEDC’s denial of subsidies. “Your notice of objection stated that there are numerous grounds on which the Recipients object, but it did not detail what those were,” a WEDC lawyer wrote to Foxconn earlier in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUTdt9"&gt;WEDC is standing by its denial of subsidies. In a letter dated December 4th, the agency wrote that the definition of the project as a Gen 10.5 LCD factory was in fact central to the contract, calling Foxconn’s claim that jobs and investment were the only terms that mattered “incomplete and flawed in several respects.” (It also noted that Foxconn hasn’t performed on the jobs or investment parts of the contract, either.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tdiTr2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foxconn also expressed openness to amending its contract&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TpT4FY"&gt;The contract explicitly defined the project as a Gen 10.5 LCD factory, and its enormous size and economic impact was the justification for the record-breaking subsidy package Foxconn received, WEDC pointed out, as it has numerous times before. “Without a Generation 10.5 TFT-LCD Fabrication Facility, there is no justification, or consideration, for the enormous tax credit incentives or expense to Wisconsin taxpayers,” WEDC wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3iIkI"&gt;WEDC ended the letter by reiterating it was open to amending the contract to reflect Foxconn’s current plans. There are signs that such an agreement might be close. After claiming the specifics of what it was building were never important, Foxconn added that it does wish to discuss amending the contract to “lower the taxpayer liability in exchange for a flexible business environment in Wisconsin.” Foxconn has previously expressed interest in such an amendment only to revert to insisting it was building an LCD factory after all, but it’s possible that with President Trump exiting the White House, the company will feel less pressure to maintain the facade that it’s building the project Trump touted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X9dq3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Incomplete and flawed in several respects.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ND3AkM"&gt;But such an amendment hinges, as always, on Foxconn telling Wisconsin what it is actually building. In a November 24th email, WEDC CEO Missy Hughes wrote to Foxconn executive Jay Lee expressing enthusiasm for revising the contract and imploring the company to provide its plans, something the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/13/21020885/foxconn-wisconsin-deal-renegotiate-tax-subsidy-lcd-factory-plant"&gt;refused to do&lt;/a&gt; for over a year and a half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FGpKo"&gt;“WEDC’s practice is to understand the company’s plan and award incentives based on that plan and its projected impact on Wisconsin’s economy,” Hughes wrote. “We base our investment on the company’s plans. Should these plans change, WEDC is prepared to amend the contract. But fundamental to an initial award is an understanding of the company’s plans. Accordingly, the next clear step for WEDC and Foxconn is to meet and for Foxconn can outline its plans for Wisconn Valley, its planned investment, and job creation. By providing specific plans about what Foxconn will build, the type of business, the types of jobs and salaries, WEDC will be able to run our analysis of the taxpayer’s return on investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="f07emx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An amendment hinges, as always, on Foxconn telling Wisconsin what it is actually building&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQY9N6"&gt;A Foxconn lawyer responded with an email agreeing to a video meeting on December 4th, saying, “I am confident that after months of discussions we are on the brink of coming to acceptable terms that will lead to an exciting future for our smart manufacturing park in Mount Pleasant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVH0wb"&gt;Neither WEDC nor Foxconn responded to a request for comment on the status of negotiations or to questions about whether Foxconn provided the required plans and projections. However, an interview with Hughes published yesterday indicates a continued lack of clarity around the project. Talks are ongoing, she told the &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2020/12/17/q-a-with-wedc-ceo-missy-hughes.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milwaukee Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and “Foxconn is helping WEDC understand what their plans are and helping us understand what their projections are so that we can analyze that and think about how we support it from the taxpayer side.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RveBZq"&gt;But Hughes seemed to acknowledge that Foxconn itself is still figuring out what to do. “For Foxconn, because they’re right at the beginning stages, there’s a lot of different ways that they’re thinking about what they’re going to be working on, whether it’s artificial intelligence or smart manufacturing, and so understanding that — and I will say get overwhelmed by the terminology and the different things — but I do think they’re very forward thinking and I think if there’s anything that Wisconsin can benefit from, from Foxconn, is that forward thinking mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;
