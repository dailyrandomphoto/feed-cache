    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Four generations and a surprising amount of redesigns  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="c9uLN0"&gt;Twenty years ago today, Microsoft released the original Xbox in North America, marking its bold entry into the world of console gaming. Since then, the design of Xbox consoles have changed almost beyond recognition. What started with a piece of big and bulky ‘90s-style electronics has (generally) gotten sleeker and more compact, and as trends have shifted, we’ve seen wired controller ports, and even some disc drives, disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75DNsy"&gt;To celebrate the anniversary, we’re taking a look back through each of the major Xbox consoles, from the original Xbox with its huge “Duke” controller, through the many iterations of the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and last year’s Series S and X. Microsoft may have technically only released four generations of Xbox in total, but there have been numerous smaller iterations made over the years as Microsoft has tweaked its designs and added support for emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="B728YP"&gt;Xbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Original Xbox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAIQTJpUaAy6-w5pO4jTvwWQLyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/2879427/originalxbox.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Xbox with its smaller Controller S. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g45RSh"&gt;Microsoft really leaned into the “X” branding for the original Xbox console, so named because of the Microsoft DirectX technology on which it was based. The whole console is designed around the letter, with a massive lime green logo in its center showing its name. But despite its stylized look, the console had a very functional design overall, with four controller ports on its front, an internal power supply, and of course a built-in ethernet port for Microsoft’s all important Xbox Live online gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvgEHU"&gt;Unlike in later generations, Microsoft didn’t release a slim version of its original Xbox console. But its controller went through a slimming process soon after its release when Microsoft replaced the original console’s hulking “Duke” controller with the much more compact “Controller S” that had originally been the standard controller for the console’s Japanese release. Despite its unwieldy size, the Duke still has its fans, so much so that accessory manufacturer Hyperkin would later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/12/15780554/microsoft-xbox-one-x-controller-original-the-duke-all-hail-hyperkin"&gt;resurrect the design&lt;/a&gt; as an Xbox One controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tvmaZI"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="xbox 360 stock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_k4qh1YViuO4QX_B6b57Al5MdbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1197762/DSC04414.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGHU0l"&gt;The Xbox 360 was a very different-looking console to the original Xbox. It now came in white as standard and ditched the giant “X” shape in favor of minimal Xbox branding along the disc tray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K99Kjt"&gt;The console was a huge success for Microsoft, and it arguably became competitive with Sony’s PlayStation for the first time, but the original machine was beset with problems that led to an &lt;a href="https://www.squaretrade.co.uk/htm/pdf/SquareTrade_Xbox360_PS3_Wii_Reliability_0809.pdf"&gt;estimated quarter of consoles&lt;/a&gt; experiencing some kind of hardware failure. Most common was the “Red Ring of Death,” so called because of the three red lights that would flash on the front of the console in the case of a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14ZjW"&gt;Microsoft would later announce an &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-07-05-xbox-360-warranty-extended-to-three-years.html#:~:text=In%20a%20monumental%20move%20for,costs%20on%20the%20malfunctioning%20consoles."&gt;extended warranty&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the issues, and over the years numerous home-brew fixes for the issues would emerge online, with sellers offering tools and replacement thermal paste to help users fix the problems themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ryf73"&gt;Other notable hardware features of the original Xbox 360 include memory unit slots on the front of the console and an easily removable (albeit proprietary) hard drive on select models. Oh, and of course there were the swappable faceplates, which Microsoft intended for users to be able to use to customize the look of their machines. There was just one problem with the faceplates: &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101223085055/http://www.oxm.co.uk/article.php?id=24558"&gt;nobody bought them&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out most people were happy enough with the original console’s white color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WAcrwz"&gt;Xbox 360 S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Reo_jZRPm6YMGcdD82csYMWfcaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015957/xbox360slim.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox 360 S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YilbIh"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-07-02-new-xbox-360-slim-250gb-review.html"&gt;Xbox 360 S&lt;/a&gt; brought two significant advantages over the original Xbox 360, or three if you include its slimmer dimensions. First was that it offered a &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-14-the-new-xbox-360-kinect-port-up-close.html"&gt;dedicated port&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-04-kinect-for-xbox-360-review.html"&gt;new Kinect peripheral&lt;/a&gt;, which let you use the new motion-tracking accessory without needing to power it from the wall separately. And second was that it was a hardware redesign that Microsoft hoped would &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-xbox-360-wont-red-ring-update-5566600"&gt;put the 360’s hardware failures clearly behind it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqNObJ"&gt;More minor changes included the introduction of the glossy black color scheme that Microsoft would continue to use well into the Xbox One generation, leaving behind the white coloring that had dominated the Xbox 360 lineup until then. It also benefitted from built-in Wi-Fi, additional USB ports, and it ditched the 360’s proprietary hard drives in favor of SATA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mbSXyC"&gt;Xbox 360 E&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-LU9Y5wtX_u8r8gp8YEuj_bxvJ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18302659/Xbox_360_E_Flat_Front.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox 360 E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fBKxqo"&gt;Microsoft released the final model of the Xbox 360 E in June 2013, just months before it would release the next-generation Xbox One. The 360 E didn’t bring with it much in the way of new features, but it had a new design that was in line with the upcoming next-gen console. Microsoft also announced that it would run quieter and cooler than previously 360 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HXpYDX"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PqQS62-sHTf_DoIGB3cGhXt8o64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13062857/IMG_5127.1484222829.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Xbox One alongside its Kinect camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eQQfSv"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/20/5117320/microsoft-xbox-one-review"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft had ambitions for its video game console to act as a central hub for all your entertainment, rather than just games. At launch it included a number of video streaming services, and there was the ability to route your cable box through the console to be able to use it to watch live TV, even while you’re playing games. Early models also came bundled with a new version of the company’s Kinect camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPi7VO"&gt;But buggy functionality, not to mention a dated VCR-style console design, limited the appeal of the original hardware. The Xbox One never delivered the home entertainment revolution that Microsoft promised, and in the years after its original launch, Microsoft would move away from these initiatives as it attempted to reposition the Xbox One as a gaming-first machine and close the extra $100 price gap with the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GbgnhH"&gt;Xbox One S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xbox One S" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_O8zYIk0_eXIsBEzGN4L945SQsA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6638773/vpavic_070616_1091_0034.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox One S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QV1wvi"&gt;Although at first glance the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348212/microsoft-xbox-one-s-review"&gt;Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt; looks like a typical mid-generation slim-down, it also included some substantial upgrades over the original console. Top of the list was the addition of a 4K Blu-ray player, as well as support for 4K / HDR video streaming services, and HDR support for games themselves. By default, it also came in a bright white color scheme, which seemed to emphasize a clean break from the largely black and gray consoles that proceeded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3COpjg"&gt;That’s not to say it wasn’t &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a much more compact console than the original Xbox One (40 percent smaller according to Microsoft), but these upgrades were significant at a time when 4K-capable disc players and streaming devices were far less common and affordable than they are now. Microsoft would later release a more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18309223/microsoft-xbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-price-release-date"&gt;disc-less model in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7xmqQ3"&gt;Xbox One X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s9duNA6iG6j0ZhGPQiZOK5Pz5oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9597305/jbareham_171102_2108_0017.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 4K-capable Xbox One X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6kahke"&gt;Originally teased under the codename “Project Scorpio,” the Xbox One X was meant as a way to bring 4K / HDR gaming to Microsoft’s Xbox One without needing to usher in a whole new generation of Xbox consoles. But despite packing in far more graphical horsepower than either the original Xbox One or the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X still managed to be remarkably compact, with a similar sharp rectangular design to the One S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBAm3V"&gt;With the benefit of hindsight, it’s interesting that Microsoft’s initial promises that the console &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11890842/microsoft-xbox-project-scorpio-virtual-reality-e3-2016"&gt;would be capable of VR&lt;/a&gt; never really came to pass. But it was tough to care given the performance upgrades the console offered over the original Xbox One, which even extended to some backward compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YcWTYf"&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TAeZAvwbNBRS5kycCzSpvekXfHU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22012245/vpavic_201103_4275_0240.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Series S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQVs7T"&gt;While it wasn’t the first time that Microsoft has offered two tiers of console in a single generation (like the “Core” edition of the Xbox 360 which came without a hard drive and had a wired controller) the Series S and Series X represent the most substantially different consoles Microsoft has ever released at the same time. The Series X looks like the future, while the Series S looks much more like an evolution of the Xbox One S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYqHbZ"&gt;Compared to the Series X, the Series S is smaller, targets 1440p rather than 4K resolutions, and can only play digital versions of games thanks to its lack of a disc drive. But Microsoft’s bet is that more budget-conscious gamers are unlikely to care when the console is available for almost half that of the more premium Xbox Series X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ayBegs"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0DN3YLKHox-Y6n8pD_B0j9i-JI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22012237/vpavic_201103_4275_0163.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot console, cool design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B92jB3"&gt;The Series X’s unique design may have drawn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/3/16/21181399/microsoft-xbox-series-x-size-fridge-comparison-measurements"&gt;frequent comparisons to a fridge&lt;/a&gt; thanks to its wide, upright design, but Microsoft doesn’t seem to mind. It’s even playfully embraced it with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538654/microsoft-xbox-series-x-fridge-competition"&gt;fully functioning Xbox-themed fridges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hlbQfp"&gt;While its design is unlike anything that Microsoft has put out before, the Series X clearly draws inspiration from the clean lines and dark color scheme of the Xbox One X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnp8Mb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yi1DzJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is apparently installing Starlink antennas at some charging stations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l4STLYvfoC-GdEVnWA3wz5q34jI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144748/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7DAPF"&gt;Charging your Tesla isn’t the most exciting experience — especially if you’re not paying for the cellular data plan that comes with a Premium Connectivity subscription — but a report from &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/14/tesla-starts-deploying-starlink-satellite-internet-systems-supercharger-stations/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that may be about to change. According to the report, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qte6h1/starlink_dish_dishy_mcflatface_spotted_at/"&gt;a user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; noticed a Starlink dish, which goes by the official name Dishy McFlatface, at a Supercharger station in Lake City, Florida. So far, it remains unclear where else Tesla has deployed (or plans to deploy) Starlink satellite dishes and what purpose they’ll serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjWSLg"&gt;It’s possible the dish will provide complimentary Wi-Fi to customers without Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/connectivity"&gt;Premium Connectivity plan&lt;/a&gt; — those with the $10 per month subscription can take advantage of Tesla’s built-in entertainment apps, such as Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, YouTube, and more with access to cellular data. If the satellite dishes are there to provide Wi-Fi while you charge your car, that means even drivers with Standard Connectivity can access in-car entertainment options while juicing up their EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7l3PMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It might have to do with Musk’s plan to make the Supercharger network available to other types of EVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3WFEX"&gt;It might also have to do with Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;Elon Musk’s plan to make the Supercharger network available&lt;/a&gt; to other types of EVs. According to &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-confirms-opening-supercharger-network-to-other-evs-what-s-the-revenue-potential-1030652724"&gt;an estimate from Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla’s annual revenue earned from charging could jump from $1 billion to $25 billion if it opens up charging stations to other EVs. The cost of charging at a Supercharger station varies throughout the day, and drivers are either charged by kilowatts per hour or by the minute. Having free internet access through Starlink might attract drivers outside of the Tesla ecosystem, maybe even helping Tesla outperform Goldman Sachs’ estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REQ2ND"&gt;Tesla already started letting non-Tesla EVs access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757159/tesla-supercharge-ev-pilot-netherlands"&gt;Supercharger stations at 10 locations in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, and it likely began the pilot there because standardized charging cable connectors are mandatory in Europe. In the US, non-Tesla EVs will need adapters to use Supercharger stations, which only complicates things. If and when Superchargers are made available to everyone, tacking on free Wi-Fi on top of speedy charging times might make other EV drivers choose Superchargers over its competitors, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409310/chargepoint-android-auto-electric-vehicle-charging-network"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629187/evgo-charging-pricing-subscription-free-charging"&gt;EVgo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VErnvn"&gt;At this time of writing, the Musk-owned SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launch-starlink-satellites-internet-constellation/"&gt;launched a total of 1,844 Starlink satellites&lt;/a&gt; into space since 2018, with the goal of providing internet access to even the remotest areas of the world. Starlink also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"&gt;more lightweight, rectangular version of Dishy McFlatface&lt;/a&gt;, although this doesn’t look like the model installed on the Florida Supercharger station.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="LAupkg"&gt;When Samsung dropped the bombshell that it was ditching Tizen for Wear OS 3, it promised &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/editorial-a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here"&gt;not to leave older Galaxy Watch models in the dust&lt;/a&gt;. Now Samsung has announced that the Galaxy Watch, Galaxy Watch 3, Galaxy Watch Active, and Galaxy Watch Active 2 will get new watchfaces and health features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782772/samsung-one-ui-4-android-12-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-release-date-features"&gt;as part of One UI 4&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cS5zr"&gt;Fall detection isn’t new on Samsung’s smartwatches, but today’s update will give you the option to tweak the feature’s sensitivity. According to Samsung’s press release, it says you can “choose to detect a fall when you are standing still.” Previously, Samsung’s fall detection feature was designed to detect hard falls when you’re running or moving. Triggering the feature will automatically send an SOS message to pre-selected contacts. That said, the feature is limited to Samsung’s newer Tizen watches and isn’t coming to the original Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Watch Active. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Examples of the fall detection feature on a Samsung watch." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jurTD9Tk7-t8omVJA9o8dhvs00A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015858/01_galaxy_watch_software_update_fall_detection.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tizen users can tweak how sensitive Samsung’s fall detection feature is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fZsPuI"&gt;Another small health feature update is Group Challenges, which lets you keep track of the competition from your wrist. All four smartwatches will also get 10 new watch faces that launched this past summer with the Galaxy Watch 4. As for when all these updates will arrive, Samsung says they’re coming to Bluetooth devices first, with the LTE rollout coming sometime later. The company also says you’ll need to update to the latest Galaxy Wearable app and Galaxy Watch plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A showcase of the 10 new watch faces" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vl_JjnRgrA1YN3FiWsNBqK-PSEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015867/04_galaxy_watch_software_update_new_watch_face.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new watch faces for the Galaxy Watch 4 are coming to older models.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bShaTr"&gt;Altogether these aren’t earth-shattering updates, but it’s encouraging to see Samsung hasn’t abandoned its Tizen smartwatches — particularly since the Galaxy Watch Active 2 and Galaxy Watch 3 were still fresh when Samsung announced it was giving up on Tizen. Google has also been steadily adding and improving features in Wear OS 2, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423707/google-wear-os-gboard-swipe-type"&gt;Gboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583906/google-play-store-wear-os-android-new-design"&gt;a revamped Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s especially important to see Samsung and Google support the older hardware, given the switch to the new unified Wear OS 3 will be a bumpy one. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 lineup represents the only smartwatches that have the platform right now, and a mere handful of existing Wear OS watches &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;will be eligible to upgrade in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabra’s Elite 75t wireless earbuds are back down to their lowest price yet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGKRmp"&gt;If you’re after a great bargain on truly wireless earbuds that we really like, check out Best Buy’s deal on the Jabra Elite 75t. These usually cost $150, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0rD3hAvWz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the black-colored model is back down to just $80&lt;/a&gt; — matching the lowest price yet. Best Buy says that this is its best deal of the season, and it’ll price match retailers if you find a better price. Consider this a great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday deal&lt;/a&gt; that you can take advantage of to get ahead with your holiday shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6PsXu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Chris Welch enjoyed the several improvements that the Elite 75t made to the already-winning Elite 65t formula. They’re smaller, with a more comfortable design. And the sound quality should please those who are looking for thumping bass. The Elite 75t can connect to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously, which is often something you can’t count on finding in a new set of wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fsgcLC"&gt;The Razer Barracuda X wireless gaming headset in the black colorway is $20 off its already-reasonable $100 price at both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0rNiJSUMf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B096N6Q51N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first price drop that I’ve seen, and this model is easy to recommend for PC and console players. It’s a lightweight model that supports a wireless 2.4GHz connection to its USB-C audio transmitter, which can plug directly into the PS5, a Nintendo Switch, or a recent MacBook, to name a few devices. It comes with a USB-A adapter and extender for other gadgets that don’t have one of those plugs. It has USB-C charging, and its array of buttons are simple to learn. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22566803/razer-barracuda-x-wireless-headset-ps5-nintendo-switch-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more coverage here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The Xbox copy will work for Xbox One consoles, as well as the newer Xbox Series X. The PS4 version includes a free upgrade to the PS5 version. Though, the PS5 version is the same cost, so get that one if you have Sony’s latest console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="lg1uHh"&gt;Razer’s Kishi controller grip is seeing steep discounts at Amazon. The Android version is always the least pricey version, and it has the lowest price today. Originally $90, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kishi-Controller-Android-Passthrough-Thumbsticks/dp/B086X8DHN2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can snag it for $55&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll fit most phones except for the most massive ones on the market. This controller is great if you want to play mobile games with a controller or have a more elegant way to play cloud games via xCloud or Stadia from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8fpzv"&gt;The version of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Controller-Gamepad-iPhone/dp/B09886XVFR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kishi made for iPhones costs $80&lt;/a&gt;, down from its original $100 price. It’s the same as the Android version, except for its Lightning port passthrough (as opposed to USB-C) and menu buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After all those podcast ads, Casper sells to a private equity firm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Casper Celebrates In LA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EePzXKuo-tmVeolcvQIy8zVjA0U=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144334/480182226.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Casper Sleep Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdk3mH"&gt;Casper Sleep is being acquired by private equity firm Durational Capital Management, which will take the boxed mattress company private, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211115005534/en/Casper-Sleep-Inc.-to-Be-Acquired-by-Durational-Capital-Management"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dF0PGy"&gt;Founded in 2014, Casper was one of a handful of companies whose ads were ubiquitous on podcasts and that sold its products directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm3I1U"&gt;The company went public in February 2020, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060460/casper-tech-ipo-mattresses"&gt;plans to expand from its primary business&lt;/a&gt; of direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales of boxed mattresses into products that “promote the ideal ambience for sleep,” according to its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598674/000104746920000166/a2240404zs-1.htm"&gt;S-1 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;. That list of products included sleep tracking devices, bedside clocks, sleep services like digital apps and counseling, and even sleep supplements. But besides mattresses and things that go on mattresses — like sheets and pillows — the most notable product Casper has produced to date is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/29/18201229/casper-mattress-glow-bedside-light-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;Glow bedside lamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygZkao"&gt;Casper began &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/casper-a-web-pioneer-to-open-200-stores-1533729600"&gt;adding retail locations in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and sold its products at retailers like Target and Mattress Warehouse, but struggled to turn a profit in the increasingly crowded direct-to-consumer (D2C) mattress market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzC0w2"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/casper-reports-third-quarter-results-131600769.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAII7sQV44U5e2qgIQZ9qsnsLZgYTFATCjQ97phKdwtZuExt9WpdKR9HRdhOA49EhWnL0vUKxPnhIrhjWgfA6PqoTMX9qRhWBezYi6RtFyvqNR4kCMbDXfDnCHe04GfVHWRQxv9lPQrrvwaSK6_vESCZlHHhth-59ZVhK2V_EAsbS"&gt;Casper reported that it lost $25.3 million&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter, compared to a loss of $15.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The company also announced that its president and chief commercial officer Emilie Arel has been appointed CEO, taking over from Casper co-founder Philip Krim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="whARUy"&gt;Casper’s board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition, which awaits approval by Casper stockholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSLsz4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The console includes a digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, which will be playable on December 8th — or possibly sooner, if you believe internet rumors about a countdown ending today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY4eu8"&gt;You can check for participating stores near you on Best Buy’s &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fclp-video-games%2Fnext-gen-consoles-event%2Fpcmcat1632156747229.c&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox in-store event page&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like the page was just posted around 6AM ET today, in line with a tweet from restocking tipster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfRestocks"&gt;Lord Restock&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LordOfRestocks/status/1459284690771320835"&gt;same account&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other console trackers, indicates the consoles will be available today from &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2FBestBuy.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BestBuy.com&lt;/a&gt;. They expect to see the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; Xbox Series X restocked along with a number of PS5s and Nintendo Switch OLEDs, however, those sales may only be available to people who are a part of Best Buy’s $200 Totaltech support membership program.&lt;/p&gt;

Best Buy notes that its employees will start handing out tickets for each product at 7:30AM local time and that you can only take a maximum of one ticket per item. If you get a ticket, Best Buy says that “you will be guaranteed the opportunity to purchase that item.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Under-display cameras are slowly getting better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0KzxHaot5gReB6iNuMOFEtYRBUI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144165/UDC_v02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VoB38H"&gt;As is often the case with new technology, under-display cameras didn’t make a great first impression. It’s a nice idea in theory, of course — you don’t need a notch or a hole-punch if you can put a selfie camera under the display — but the earliest efforts had some issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGn1Zb"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 last year was the first phone to ship with one, and it was bad. The camera quality was incredibly poor, and the area of the screen looked more distracting than a notch. Samsung followed up this year with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which had similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zlghiy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The world’s first under-display selfie camera isn’t very good","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="n8DWBZ"&gt;But things are actually getting better. Two newer phones on the market, Xiaomi’s Mix 4 and ZTE’s Axon 30, use a different approach to the technology, and it’s an improvement on the previous generation. Instead of having a lower resolution area of the screen that allows light through to the camera, they shrink the size of the pixels without reducing the number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUPvyE"&gt;This means that the part of the screen that covers the camera is really difficult to see in normal use. Look at how the Axon 30 compares to the Axon 20 on a white background, which was the most challenging situation for the older phone to disguise the camera in. It’s also much harder to make out than the camera on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PtU8R9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10865855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hDMSTZ"&gt;Image quality from the camera is improved, too. Look at these selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0SGA5EZ5oacEfndGn3D1Kscres=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23015429/ztecomp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A selfie from ZTE’s Axon 20 on the left, and from the Axon 30 on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YH093A"&gt;Now, the camera is clearly still compromised compared to one that doesn’t have to gather light from behind a screen. ZTE and Xiaomi lean hard on algorithms for post-processing — you can tell because the live image preview looks much worse than the final picture. The results still look over-processed and unnatural, even if they’re more usable than their predecessors’. Video quality is also bad, because it’s probably too much to ask for these phones to do the processing in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ10Pg"&gt;Still, the pictures you get are definitely usable most of the time. If you’re not a big selfie person, or if you don’t use your phone for Zoom calls, I think you could get away with it. If those use cases are important to you, though, you should probably stick with a hole punch or a notch. Especially if you just don’t care about hole punches or notches, as I believe is the case for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBjkrc"&gt;There’s more to the idea than just reducing the size of your phone bezels, though. We spoke to Steven Bathiche from Microsoft’s Applied Sciences group on how the company is working on under-display cameras for an entirely different reason — so you can maintain eye contact while looking at your screen on video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEdVii"&gt;For that conversation, as well as more on how ZTE and Xiaomi’s phones work in practice, check out the video up top.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Spruce up your digs with some clever gadgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nmh7YT"&gt;Home is what you make it, so why not make it as awesome as possible? Sometimes, that can be done by just hanging up a sentimental photo in a frame or spritzing things up occasionally with some flowers or a new piece of furniture. Every now and again, however, you just need to gift yourself some crafty home tech goodies or buy them for someone you care about. Not every item in the list below has a circuit board built into it — though many of them do; instead, what ties them all together is that, in small ways, they’ll make your home look better and operate more smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPlj3d"&gt;We’ve consulted the minds at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for their ideas, and what follows are a couple dozen gift ideas for anyone who’s looking to liven up their abode with some clever home tech. From an affordable robot vacuum and smart lighting to a 4K TV that moonlights as a Monet when not in use, there’s something for everyone on our list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for moms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zeosgij68RQdPjnroiORldVLV2M=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70144233/Mom.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gift ideas that go beyond the flower bouquet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5etm1R"&gt;If you were to ask your mom what she wants for the holidays, she’ll likely tell you “nothing” — followed by something equally unhelpful like “your happiness.” That’s because moms can be loving, selfless superheroes who often prioritize the needs of their loved ones over their own. While admirable, that also means you’re not going to get much help from them when it comes to buying the perfect gift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZ0tVR"&gt;Thankfully, we’ve gathered plenty of great presents you can surprise your mom with. We've included a monthly candle subscription for those in need of some relaxation ($10), as well as an annual pass that allows for unfettered access to our national parks ($80). And for the fitness enthusiast, we recommend the Apple Watch SE ($270), a smartwatch that is — lucky for you — more affordable than other Apple wearables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrhYJI"&gt;Below, you’ll find other gifts that cater to all kinds of budgets and passions, ranging from books and instant cameras to Apple’s latest desktop. Peruse the list and see if there’s anything on here that might resonate with your mom this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
