    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony just got a restock of the PS5&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InjNmw"&gt;If you’re still trying to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, lining up at Sony’s digital storefront is one of the more reliable ways to snag Sony’s next-gen console. Sony &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;has reopened the digital queue on its direct store&lt;/a&gt; to place orders for the $500 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the $400 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqKvo7"&gt;Provided you’ve already &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/ps5"&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; and logged into your PlayStation account, you should be able to line up once you’ve hit the landing page. Once you’ve entered the queue, you’ll be given an ETA of when you’ll be able to check out and, once that timer hits zero, it's all systems go. It's no secret that these consoles go quick and getting into the queue doesn’t necessarily guarantee a console, but Sony’s direct store remains one of the more reliable ways to get ahold of the PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI8v4N"&gt;If you’re still deliberating which console is the better fit for you, let's chat a little about the differences between these two consoles. Both models of the PS5, the standard model ($500) and the Digital Edition ($400), are virtually identical with the exception of the inclusion of a UHD Blu-Ray disc drive on the standard edition. Because it doesn’t have a disc drive, the Digital Edition is a little lighter and slimmer, but still features the same 825GB SSD. Both consoles are compatible with the same games, however,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="hFdeY8"&gt;What's a new gaming console without accessories? If you’ve managed to snag a PS5, make sure you left a little wiggle room in your budget for peripherals and games, too. Here are some of our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart DTD 555" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J1sVDLMyFhHiEXvLMs9mRbpKOfk=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70154121/walmart555.1419973090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is already discounting the AirPods Pro, Google Nest Mini, and a host of other products ahead of Black Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AtjyQ3"&gt;As Black Friday approaches, several retailers are already offering significant discounts — and Walmart is no exception. Right now, the retail giant is dropping early Black Friday deals on everything from the AirPods Pro to the most popular TVs and streaming devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uTIwf"&gt;We’ve featured a few of these items in our guide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, however, the list below highlights all of the best sales Walmart is offering across several categories rather than just a few. It’s perfect, then, for anybody who plans on shopping primarily at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OVcC4"&gt;The store will continue to publish more deals as we get closer to the big day, with many of the better deals going live on November 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fstore%2F3520-secaucus-nj%2Fweekly-ads&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent online circular&lt;/a&gt;. If you subscribe to Walmart Plus, the retailer’s equivalent to Amazon Prime, you’ll also gain access to the deals four hours in advance. Regardless of when you plan on doing your shopping, however, we’ll continue to update this page throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="XIU118"&gt;Walmart is also discounting select sizes of the LG OLED A1 TV, selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-65-Class-4K-UHD-Smart-TV-OLED-A1-Series-OLED65A1PUA%2F572189714&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch&lt;/a&gt;, for example, for $1,497 instead of $2,500. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-55-Class-4K-UHD-Smart-OLED-TV-A1-Series-OLED55A1PUA%2F892384871&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt; is selling for $1,097 instead of $1,700.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

They offer nearly twice as much battery life, and right now you can buy them for $79 instead of $150 at Walmart. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes tells the jury that at least some of Theranos was real</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-BIOTECH-TRIAL-THERANOS-FRAUD" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1Eq_NuyoIwJ4RUyesZJKpNFs18=/0x0:4608x3072/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180472/1236737577.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AMY OSBORNE/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0e0HOu"&gt;So far, Elizabeth Holmes’ defense has been at pains to show us that Theranos had a real device and worked with real pharmaceutical companies. That actually hasn’t been in question, particularly in the time period the defense was asking about. Still, the point seems to be &lt;em&gt;hey, look, some things at Theranos were real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPQ2k9"&gt;But today, in her wire fraud trial, we saw a science-y presentation — not actual science, just the marketing version. We saw the guts of Theranos devices. We heard about the company iterating on the device. We saw emails with pharma companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0Z2vO"&gt;Theranos’ work with drug companies was never in question; we saw money Theranos made from that work early in the prosecution’s case, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;comptroller Danise Yam&lt;/a&gt;. The issue with drug companies has been the “validation” reports that Theranos produced about its own technology in those partnerships. Though those reports were written by Theranos employees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;investors said&lt;/a&gt; they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;thought the reports&lt;/a&gt; had been written by the pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8mefs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes acknowledged that Theranos didn’t work with the Defense Department at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWlRvr"&gt;Making matters worse, two reports we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;bore logos for Schering-Plough and Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;. The Schering-Plough memo had also been gussied up relative to its original version. When Theranos first sent the report to Schering-Plough, it did not have the pharma company’s logo on it, and read that Theranos “give accurate and precise results.” The version Walgreens saw had Schering-Plough’s logo and language that said “give more accurate and precise results… than current ‘gold standard’ reference methods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo9pdO"&gt;Investors testified that the work Theranos had done with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;pharmaceutical companies and the armed forces&lt;/a&gt; had been important. They thought that meant the drug companies and the Defense Department had co-signed the technology, using it on clinical trials and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/JQ8iFuWnlVuVFvduRrBp"&gt;in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; — a lie journalist &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;Roger Parloff heard, too&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Holmes acknowledged that Theranos didn’t work with the Defense Department at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym8zJ5"&gt;Her testimony was brief — the trial was delayed an hour and a half for a meeting in the judge’s chambers between attorneys for the two sides. The reason for the meeting wasn’t explained. The court session also ended relatively early, at 1PM Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZqZOv"&gt;Holmes, who seemed at ease on the stand, was asked to explain why the cartridges on the Series 1.0 device didn’t work. They were stacked and held together with adhesive, but the adhesive could come loose, which let the stacked layers peel apart so they wouldn’t work properly. I wasn’t entirely sure why this would matter — we knew Theranos was iterating on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AMDJKl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pXAPS9"&gt;Her answers were largely non-technical; whether that was because she didn’t have technical knowledge, or because she wanted to make sure she wasn’t confusing the jury, wasn’t clear to me. At times, Holmes’ testimony hewed so closely to documents that we were being shown that it was funny. After reading emails, she’d be asked what they meant, and would respond with, nearly word-for-word, a sentence in the email. In a slideshow, one slide was titled “Completed Successes.” Holmes’ attorney, Kevin Downey, asked her what success meant in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xg0fOh"&gt;“A success was that we had successfully achieved the objectives of the program,” she replied. And when it came to Theranos’ performance? “I remember it being really good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nExXfI"&gt;The “completed successes,” in Theranos’ parlance, were almost all preliminary drug company studies. One exception was a study done with Stanford, which &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4091290/"&gt;was actually published.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mtjj2y"&gt;The outlines of the work with many drug companies were largely the same. A big drug company would do preliminary work with Theranos, which Holmes would typically characterize as successful. But no clinical trial work manifested. This was true for Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Celgene. Theranos did create tests for AstraZeneca and worked on a clinical trial for Centocor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oHnILI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think calling her every single morning for the last three weeks finally paid off…”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PuQb2F"&gt;In the Centocor trial, the Theranos device was tested against standard labs. Asked about how her device fared in comparison, Holmes said, “It performed well.”  Many of her answers were brief and matter-of-fact, as though she were discussing the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbWEsA"&gt;The most interesting parts of her testimony, however, had to do with Pfizer and Schering-Plough. Crucially, for Holmes to be found guilty of wire fraud, the government must show that she knew she was lying when she gave investors bad information — mistakes aren’t illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKE7Yj"&gt;So we saw some emails. At Schering-Plough, Constance Cullen had been Theranos’ main point of contact. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;Cullen testified earlier&lt;/a&gt;, for the prosecution.) As Cullen testified, her company was bought by Merck while she was in contact with Holmes, and since she was put in charge of a newly-combined group, work with Theranos fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl8D96"&gt;In an email from a Theranos employee to Holmes, the employee wrote that Cullen was swamped with work from the acquisition. “All in all it was awesome,” the email went on. “I think calling her every single morning for the last three weeks finally paid off…” Holmes was asked directly if Cullen informed her of Schering-Plough’s low opinion of Theranos’ tests. Holmes said no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q63jnp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’ve seen that a lot of drug companies passed on doing real work with Theranos&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0EqchN"&gt;You can see where this is going — a &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;generous read of the situation is that Holmes didn’t realize the technology was bad or that Merck didn’t want to work with her, she just thought that her contact dropped the ball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9EXwl"&gt;As for Pfizer, the defense produced emails that showed Holmes had continued talking to the company about a partnership as late as 2015. In that email, a Pfizer employee proposed using Theranos’ Walgreens centers as clinical trial sites. This did not come to fruition, and Thearnos didn’t work on a clinical trial for Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO25d2"&gt;It is possible to believe that all these drug companies looked into Theranos’ device and chose not to move forward for unrelated reasons  — but that’s a big stretch. Put together, we’ve seen that a lot of drug companies passed on doing real work with Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvZCqK"&gt;The thing about today’s presentation, though, is that Theranos’ early work isn’t contested. According to the government, the fraud didn’t start until later. Besides, liars don’t lie &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="L11i8Z"&gt;As she gets closer to testifying about some of the other areas of interest, though, I hope there’s just as much contemporaneous email evidence. Because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;having now heard Parloff’s tapes of Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, I was struck by how confidently she’d lied and how believable she sounded. Being preceded by those tapes means that no matter how confident or trustworthy she sounds, I still find myself doubting what she says unless there’s something else to confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will pay $5.3 million to San Francisco to settle allegations over benefits violations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EYo_BV0buASyyQHkTW2lJoHoCFU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180435/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash settled with San Francisco for $5.3 million | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jwB5Xm"&gt;Food delivery platform &lt;a href="https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2021/11/22/san-francisco-secures-over-5-million-settlement-for-doordash-workers/"&gt;DoorDash has agreed&lt;/a&gt; to pay $5.3 million to the city of San Francisco to settle allegations it failed to provide healthcare and paid sick leave to some 4,500 delivery drivers, as the city requires. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, most of which will be used to reimburse drivers who made deliveries in the city between 2016 and 2020, before a new state law covering gig workers took effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ICKaI"&gt;California’s gig workers law, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;voters approved in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as ballot measure Proposition 22, allows companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to treat workers as independent contractors, not employees. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635286/judge-rules-california-prop-22-gig-workers-law-unconstitutional"&gt;judge ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that the law was unconstitutional, but it remains in effect pending an appeal by the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3brQHp"&gt;“We believe (DoorDash couriers) were misclassified and should have been employees for years,” San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu told the &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/DoorDash-to-pay-5-3-million-to-S-F-couriers-16636498.ph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was first to report the news Monday. “That is not part of the settlement but it is the perspective of the city.” As part of the settlement announced Monday, most drivers will get between $500 and $1,000, and the Chronicle reported that both sides agreed to the settlement to avoid a prolonged court battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERyhcR"&gt;“We are proud of the flexible earning opportunities and meaningful benefits and protections Proposition 22 affords Dashers across California,” DoorDash spokeswoman Briana Megid said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “While we deny any wrongdoing, we feel that this settlement represents a fair compromise that will allow us to focus on continuing to provide the best experience for Dashers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVBHsz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tile is selling its Bluetooth tracking business to Life360 for $205 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple, Tile, and Samsung all offer smart Bluetooth trackers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xN5MSY7SpMUzSz28Pw_InmyY5jg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180433/ajohnson_210702_4659_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me6qU1"&gt;Tile popularized marking items and tracking them from your phone with its small Bluetooth tags, but is suddenly facing more competition from giants like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. Now the company that started out of an incubator &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/tile-grabs-2-6m-via-selfstarter-for-its-lost-property-finding-bluetooth-tags-plus-app/"&gt;and crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html"&gt;has announced it will be acquired by Life360&lt;/a&gt;, which calls itself a “leading family safety platform.” The deal is valued at $205 million and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUtvVv"&gt;Tile has developed its product line over the years with a variety of different trackers, as well as partnerships with other companies to use its technology. It also has a subscription service, Tile Premium, with extra features, battery replacements, and even offers insurance against potential losses. However, the game may have changed once Apple and Google started building their own item-locating features into iPhones and Android devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btPUOi"&gt;Life360 bills itself as an overall family safety app, with location sharing between family members, crash detection, and other features. Over the summer, it said announced that it has over 1 million paying customers, and reported its valuation had crossed $1 billion. It also acquired another item locating hardware startup, Jiobit, which makes cellular-connected trackers for kids and pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9LB6Q"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.life360.com%2Fblog%2Ftile-joins-life360%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2F22797559%2Ftile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a blog post announcing the Tile acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, Life360 CEO and co-founder Chris Hulls says, “The combination of Life360 and Tile means safety just got a whole lot simpler for millions of families and individuals around the world. We’ll be bundling Tile devices as part of our Membership plans, and Tile will offer Life360 Membership benefits to its customers. We’ll also start work on integrating our technologies so Tile devices, Jiobit wearables, and Life360 app customers will show up on a unified map – people, pets, and things all in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;

Samsung launched its own pocket-sized Bluetooth trackers, and Amazon is building on Echo devices to enable tracking via the Sidewalk network (Tile announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRA5R4"&gt;Tile recently announced its first ultra-wideband enabled tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022"&gt;the Tile Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch next year and has the advantage of working with both mobile platforms to provide much more precise tracking. Still, as Tile vice president and general counsel Kirsten Daru &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21070812/sonos-tile-basecamp-popsocket-congressional-hearing-amazon-google-apple-competition"&gt;said to Congress last year in reference to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, “You might be the best soccer team, but you’re playing against a team that owns the stadium, the ball, and the league, and can change the rules when it wants.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC approves $6 billion Verizon-Tracfone acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S2GUm5vwQHbxbIjEWs02y1pEK5Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70180043/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ib4gJG"&gt;On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission voted to approve Verizon Wireless’ purchase of Tracfone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435980/verizon-tracfone-acquisition-prepaid-phones-budget"&gt;in a deal worth more than $6 billion&lt;/a&gt;, positioning Verizon to become one of the largest prepaid service providers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQJqTB"&gt;Tracfone is the largest reseller of wireless devices in the US and maintains over 20 million subscribers with more than 90,000 retail locations. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621905/verizon-tracfone-merger-lifeline-fcc-public-interest"&gt;Verizon’s Tracfone acquisition&lt;/a&gt; combines the largest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) with the largest wireless provider in the country. When Verizon first proposed the deal last September, the company said that the acquisition would bolster Tracfone’s networks while making low-income wireless services more competitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wN31HY"&gt;“After rigorous review, the Commission found that the transaction, as modified by Verizon’s enforceable commitments, will make Verizon and Tracfone stronger providers of prepaid and Lifeline services,” the FCC said in a Monday press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MItMBV"&gt;It’s unclear which commissioners voted to approve the deal. Currently, there are only two Democrats and two Republicans serving at the agency, meaning at least one Democrat would have been required to approve the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoxN4U"&gt;As part of its decision to approve the deal, the FCC said that it would be requiring Verizon to make several consumer protection agreements with the agency. First, Verizon promised to continue its participation in the Lifeline subsidy program for at least seven years. The company must also provide “cost-effective” 5G devices and services to Lifeline customers. Verizon must also submit semi-annual reports describing how its compliance meets these restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zJIEE"&gt;Last Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-requires-consumer-protection-measures-for-verizon-acquisition-of-tracfone"&gt;the California Public Utility Commission&lt;/a&gt; approved the deal, mandating similar restrictions to those imposed by the FCC. However, the California regulators required Verizon’s Tracfone to participate in the Lifeline program for at least 20 years. Customers will also receive free 5G-compatible devices and should not see wireless plan price increases over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em4Fas"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Starting in October, many retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — began lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"&gt;have price-matching policies&lt;/a&gt; that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nypGAV"&gt;Latest deal highlights:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YeaHyy"&gt;If you’re a PlayStation gamer, Amazon is offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B09JTZSB3R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year membership to PlayStation Plus for just $40&lt;/a&gt; ($20 off).

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model is on sale for $1,097&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is selling for $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1. Best Buy is offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWewqARCyb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same discounts&lt;/a&gt;, except with 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV, a camera accessory that brings wide-angle video chats to your TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,498&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWeAej60sy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is matching this deal&lt;/a&gt; as well, and including 30 days of FuboTV Pro as well as the option to save $90 on Facebook Portal TV. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a staggering $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG’s WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 Series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YkAdjB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wcr0Gl"&gt;Naturally, Amazon is offering some great discounts on its own products, taking between $140 and $150 off the Omni Series (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;) and 4-Series 4K Fire TVs (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lDDnQ9"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on streaming devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-2021-streaming-device-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-with-voice-remote-and-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vrWZYkTQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is offering the streaming device for just $29. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ADYgqg"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on laptops and tablets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S Mode is on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sBxrPIx7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $330&lt;/a&gt; instead of $500. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $180 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eNqjUh"&gt;The Dell XPS 15 ultrabook is currently enjoying a solid discount. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836602-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Fxps-15-9510-laptop%2Fsmx15w11p1c6700p%3Fpreview%3Doff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell has reduced the price of this particular configuration to $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, taking $396 off the usual price tag. This is the best deal we’ve seen on this laptop so far, with some retailers charging as much as $2,600 for the same configuration. This model boasts some impressive specs with an 11th Gen Core i9 CPU and an RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, not to mention 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Our reviewer, Monica Chin, liked the 16:10 display and snappy keyboard, even though the XPS 15 tended to get a little hot under load. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="vAdouM"&gt;The latest model of the Dell XPS 13 takes what made last year’s model so great and makes it better.

While not quite the same configuration, aforementioned reviewer Monica Chin described the Dell XPS 13 as the company’s “best-in-class 13-inch ultraportable laptop.” This particular configuration comes equipped with an Intel Core i7-1195G7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. While the integrated Iris Xe GPU doesn’t have enough juice for gaming, this lightweight laptop is remarkably versatile and remains a powerful choice in the 13-inch laptop class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21310825" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The 2021 iPad Pro is also a speed demon thanks to Apple’s M1 chip and comes with welcome features such as a Mini LED display, Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 support, and Face ID, which allows you to unlock the device with just a glance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="AygW13"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — in black for $247 or in white for $223. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port and a compact, foldable design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While this phone doesn’t come packaged with a complimentary pair of earbuds like some other models, you do get a free 11-inch Chromebook. While free is generally a good thing, just note that the model on offer here isn’t exactly premium, as it comes with just 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Unlocked-Smartphone-Long-Lasting/dp/B08BX7N9SK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon also has the Note 20 Ultra for $1,100&lt;/a&gt; though without any freebies. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This is the only model currently on sale that doesn’t net you any extra goodies, but it’s a solid value regardless. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

While all eyes are on the new Pixel 6, we still stand by the Pixel 5A as a solid and affordable entry. Featuring one of the best cameras available in a midrange smartphone, the 5G-compatible 5A also comes equipped with 128GB of onboard storage, IP67 water resistance, and improved battery life. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id="49W4Z1"&gt;A three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is $25 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1204229/2092?subId1=Verge%252CBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals112221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital%2F-%2FA-76626995" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fgift-cards%2Fdigital-subscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, granting you access to online multiplayer, exclusive discounts, and a robust library of Xbox games at a fraction of what the subscription normally retails for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TImMO9"&gt;Probably the best deal in gaming — one that spans video games and tabletop games — is Target’s &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1187777/2092?subId1=VergeBestEarlyBlackFridayDeals111121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fbuy-2-get-1-free-mix-match%2F-%2FN-93tfb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mix and Match sale&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to buy two items from an approved list and get a third for free. The list of items the sale covers is robust, and includes everything from board games, to craft supplies, to some of the latest video games. If you can think of a faster way to fill your stockings this holiday, we’d like to hear it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="4ie8in"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860156"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, one of the best PlayStation 5 exclusives to date, is down to just $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ratchet-Clank-Rift-Apart-PlayStation-5/dp/B095T8C99C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fratchet-and-clank-rift-apart----playstation-5%2F11118328.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YI7fLA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, an excellent exclusive for the PS5 and PC, is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F11112058.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $25 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pbANF8"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Viper-Ultralight-Ambidextrous-Gaming/dp/B08QVM2JMQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sF0uNz2W" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$38 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good, but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="LClDhH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $170 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bE0eBv"&gt;The best Black Friday deals on cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="OnH62Q"&gt;The older GoPro Hero8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is offering a bundle that includes the popular 4K action cam for just $249&lt;/a&gt;. Other retailers offer &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3ssYV7eRw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the camera alone for $250&lt;/a&gt;, so this bundle is the better value. It includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. The HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6WQkzQ"&gt;The latest GoPro, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;, is currently selling at its lowest price ever. Normally $500, B&amp;amp;H is now selling the popular action cam for $450. The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yD4GfA"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is starting to release several deals on cameras from Sony, Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Fujifilm, Panasonic, and more. This includes the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1670051-REG%2Fcanon_canon_eos_r_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EOS R mirrorless camera&lt;/a&gt;, which is selling for $1,599 instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18200083/nikon-z7-z6-canon-eos-r-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our Canon EOS R review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZr7KF"&gt;Sony’s ZV-1 point-and-shoot camera is currently &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1566753-REG%2Fsony_sony_zv_1_digital_camera.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759214%2Fblack-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $746&lt;/a&gt; with a vlogger accessory kit at B&amp;amp;H, a savings of $150. The bundle includes the 20MP, 4K-capable camera as well as a wireless shooting grip and a 64GB memory card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="dfpgis"&gt;A great companion to any streamer or podcaster, the Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $100&lt;/a&gt;, matching one of its best prices to date. The Yeti can conform to a number of recording environments thanks to the Blue VO!CE software, which allows you to change pickup patterns, modulate, and otherwise fine-tune your audio. The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that's more your style. The current discount applies to the black, blue, grey, and silver models, meaning you’ve got a variety of styles to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEhlAt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10650797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Dqr58c"&gt;Amazon is currently offering some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/4998f143?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=26&amp;amp;imprToken=c2be8a99-20b2-dfab-0c4&amp;amp;showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_8_4998f143_dt_sl5_f1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22541018%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;excellent savings on a variety of Shure microphones&lt;/a&gt;. These include some of the heavy-hitters of the podcast world, like the broadcast-quality SM7B and its newer offspring: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B08G7RG9ML?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Microphone-Podcasting-Voice-Isolating-Technology/dp/B09BZZCGC8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MV7X&lt;/a&gt;. All three mics are discounted, with, for example, the Shure SM7B going for $359 instead of $399 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SM7B-Cardioid-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B0002E4Z8M?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AhcBZ8"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date.

    <title>Prime Gaming is giving away EA games over the next few months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_BL_S1oeI8NzvSd3_powxmKFsbo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179787/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LIGPO3"&gt;Amazon and EA will be &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/tis-the-season-for-even-more-new-free-games-and-in-game-content-for-prime-gaming-members-9fd509131336"&gt;giving away free PC games&lt;/a&gt; and content through Amazon’s Prime Gaming program for the next few months, so it may be time to &lt;a href="http://gaming.amazon.com/"&gt;check in on the gaming service&lt;/a&gt; if you’ve forgotten that it comes included with Prime. This month, Prime subscribers will be able to get a free Origin code for the surprisingly decent remaster of 2010’s &lt;em&gt;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon says that four more of EA’s “most popular titles” will be coming in 2022 (though given the starting game, it may be worth keeping your expectations in check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aCQrd"&gt;If it’s still November when you’re reading this, you &lt;a href="https://primegaming.blog/spend-the-holiday-season-gaming-with-family-and-friends-with-new-free-games-and-content-from-prime-b180be31c66e"&gt;can also snag&lt;/a&gt; EA’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age Inquisition&lt;/em&gt; for free from Prime Gaming. Amazon’s partnership with EA also includes skins for games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, as well as some additional content for EA Sports games that’ll be “rolling out over the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="jnGOwK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;EA games aren’t the only ones on offer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ldhwr5"&gt;As usual, you’ll also be able to get a number of other free games with Prime Gaming as well. The games available in December probably won’t blow your mind but should be good romps for any holiday vacations you have coming up; there’s &lt;em&gt;Frostpunk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Football Manager 2021&lt;/em&gt;, and TellTale’s take on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F9ahZQ7oP0"&gt;beloved &lt;em&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tales of Monkey Island&lt;/em&gt;. Also included are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Yrj10r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morkredd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RsbI49"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spellcaster University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RIQ7I2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTubers Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A8e2cn"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse (&lt;/em&gt;what a name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lDVaOs"&gt;Amazon hasn’t said what EA games will be coming next, but it’s probably worth keeping an eye on. As maligned as the publisher can be (oftentimes for good reasons), it does have some solid titles, and it’d be hard to complain about getting them for free. Personally, I’m crossing my fingers that the collection of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZQZgeSMx8"&gt;remastered &lt;em&gt;Command &amp;amp; Conquer&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt; will be one of the upcoming free titles so I can get a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w-FQoNrwHM"&gt;sweet, sweet hit of nostalgia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is now delivering diapers and food by drone (if you live close to this Arkansas store)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luRuvEdVAFC1WHfSaEWluenmmfk=/0x2:3000x2002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179775/DroneUp_Hub_Flight_Engineers.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WWXWAd"&gt;Just last week, Walmart made headlines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22786919/walmart-zipline-drone-delivery-commercial-service-arkansas"&gt;by launching its first commercial US drone delivery service&lt;/a&gt; within a 50-mile radius of Pea Ridge, Arkansas — dropping parachute-laden packages from an autonomous Zipline plane to a “hand-selected group of recipients.” Now, it’s already expanding those drone deliveries in another, small way: customers who live in Farmington, Arkansas, &lt;a href="https://droneupdelivery.com/"&gt;can now order small items&lt;/a&gt; like cans of tuna, baby supplies, and paper plates starting today. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.droneup.com/2021/11/22/walmart-droneup-announce-first-multi-site-drone-delivery-operation/"&gt;thanks to a partnership with DroneUp&lt;/a&gt;, which will also provide drone delivery stations in Rogers, AR and Bentonville, AR “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emZW8R"&gt;While it’s kind of exciting for drone delivery watchers, you should know that it’s also very much baby steps. DroneUp’s traditional quadcopters only deliver within a one-mile radius of a Walmart store — and all three of these stores are within the same region that Zipline already announced it would serve. They do, however, lower their packages down on cables rather than dropping them from the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtkujpGs1sEJfgiIgw2_IdWaU6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035478/farmington_ar_drone_radius_walmart_droneup.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here’s what a 1-mile radius around &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Walmart+Neighborhood+Market/@36.0372031,-94.2595164,1636m/data=!3m2!1e3!5s0x87c970403386bb8d:0xb886ea455159ec68!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x665cc8ece83138d8!2sWalmart+Neighborhood+Market!8m2!3d36.0369101!4d-94.2564392!3m4!1s0x0:0x665cc8ece83138d8!8m2!3d36.0369101!4d-94.2564392" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Farmington Walmart store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; looks like.&lt;/em&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A zoomed out look at Walmart’s drone delivery footprint. Smaller circles are DroneUp 1-mile radii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtsEcK"&gt;Walmart did seem to have quite the selection of essentials to offer when we typed in a local address. We spotted a 26-count pack of diapers, a box of buttermilk pancake mix, paper plates, crayons, trash bags, vitamins, scotch tape, and page after page of basic food items and baby items (including baby food). Every item has a weight, and the website will only let you check out with 4 pounds of goods or less for a $10 delivery fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpLGrA"&gt;The heaviest thing we saw was a 3.87-pound box of Similac baby formula, and the priciest was a $29.88 bottle of extra virgin olive oil. 1.5 pounds worth of canned tuna, a 2.4-pound bottle of Pedialyte and a 3.58-pound box of mixed fruit cups are also within reach if you live in the (tiny) region that Walmart and DroneUp now serve. DroneUp says customers can get orders as quickly as 30 minutes (but isn’t promising a typical delivery time) and says each hub can launch multiple flights per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UsSbrYaa50OXkEoa4iY-7LFd0RU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23035483/droneup_shopping_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vBpAw1"&gt;(Weirdly, you can’t sort Walmart’s items by weight to make selections easier, and the shopping cart doesn’t seem to be smart enough to restrict you by volume: I added 27 lightweight cups of ramen to my cart without triggering a flag at all, and I’m pretty sure they won’t all fit in that drone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti67Hu"&gt;Walmart and DroneUp &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/22/walmart-now-piloting-drone-delivery-of-covid-19-at-home-self-collection-kits"&gt;previously trialed COVID-19 test drone deliveries&lt;/a&gt; in a one-mile radius of stores in North Las Vegas and Cheektowaga, New York, and Walmart made &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/06/17/walmart-invests-in-droneup-the-nationwide-on-demand-drone-delivery-provider"&gt;an undisclosed investment in DroneUp&lt;/a&gt; this summer. DroneUp still isn’t saying what Walmart invested or how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvVTXF"&gt;Here’s a video from DroneUp about what the deliveries might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BZZroz"&gt;

    <title>Dodge will phase out gas-powered Charger and Challenger in 2024 to make way for EVs</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Dodge Charger Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syz4-pCiT2Z18CvMUp8dzzATUTw=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70179761/1291299299.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P7DEpG"&gt;Dodge will cease production of its gas-powered Charger sedan and Challenger coupe in 2024 in order to make way for the automaker’s first electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uBWkV"&gt;Dodge Brand CEO Tim Kuniskis shed some new light on the timeline in an interview this week &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-challenger-charger-dead-2024-ev-coming-soon"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company will roll out its first electric muscle concept car in 2022, followed by a plug-in hybrid vehicle and a mysterious third vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS2Roh"&gt;Dodge had previously announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568272/dodge-electric-muscle-car-2024-stellantis-ev-day"&gt;intention to produce its first EV in 2024&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568625/stellantis-jeep-dodge-ev-day-shark-drone-autonomous"&gt;July event covering electric vehicle strategy&lt;/a&gt; by the automaker’s parent company, Stellantis. During the event, Kuniskis proclaimed that Dodge would not “sell electric cars — it will sell eMuscle,” which is apparently Dodge branding for its future EVs. The first eMuscle cars will go into production in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OteG50"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dodge had previously announced its intention to produce its first EV in 2024 &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pWsap"&gt;At the time, Kuniskis didn’t reveal the fate of the company’s internal combustion engine vehicles. Now we know that they will be phased out as the company shifts resources over to EV production. “These cars that you know today will go out of production by the time we get to 2024,” Kuniskis told &lt;em&gt;Motor Trend&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgplL5"&gt;Dodge’s future EVs will sport the Fratzog logo that was initially used by the company in the 1960s and 70s. It features a split deltoid made of three arrowhead shapes that form a three-pointed star. The new version is designed to be three-dimensional and includes LED lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFJkFM"&gt;In addition to electric versions of Charger and Challenger vehicles, Dodge also plans on producing electric trucks, including a battery-powered Ram 1500 that would compete with Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning. Dodge’s sister companies, like Jeep, Chrysler, and brands from the PSA Groupe, are also producing EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="up8DNf"&gt;It remains unclear how muscle car fans will react to the news that their beloved Hemi engines aren’t long for this world. EVs are no slouches when it comes to acceleration, with many electric sports cars boasting of quicker 0–60 times than most gas equivalents. Where they do differentiate, though, is the sound — or rather the absence of sound — as they accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;
