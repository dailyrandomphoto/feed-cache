    <title>Researchers trigger new exploit by renaming an iPhone and a Tesla</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9gPVK"&gt;Security researchers investigating the recently discovered and “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;extremely bad&lt;/a&gt;” Log4Shell exploit claim to have used it on devices as varied as iPhones and Tesla cars. Per &lt;a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface/blob/master/pages/Tesla.md"&gt;screenshots&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chvancooten/status/1469340927923826691"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, changing the device name of an iPhone or Tesla to a special exploit string was enough to trigger a ping from Apple or Tesla servers, indicating that the server at the other end was vulnerable to Log4Shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBgwtV"&gt;In the demonstrations, researchers switched the device names to be a string of characters that would send servers to a testing URL, exploiting the behavior enabled by the vulnerability. After the name was changed, incoming traffic showed URL requests from IP addresses belonging to Apple and, in the case of Tesla, China Unicom — the company’s &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/29/investing/tesla-china-unicom/"&gt;mobile service partner for the Chinese market&lt;/a&gt;. In short, the researchers tricked Apple and Tesla servers into visiting a URL of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple device information screen showing name changed to log4shell attack string" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9CiTGhvWjcLo_v6eeSyFxtC2GKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085291/log4shell1.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An iPhone device information screen with name changed to contain the exploit string.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc5cRA"&gt;The iPhone demonstration came from a Dutch security researcher; the other was uploaded to the anonymous &lt;a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface"&gt;Log4jAttackSurface&lt;/a&gt; Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLI6ry"&gt;Assuming the images are genuine, they show behavior — remote resource loading — that should not be possible with text contained in a device name. This proof of concept has led to widespread reporting that Apple and Tesla are vulnerable to the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoQIub"&gt;While the demonstration is alarming, it’s not clear how useful it would be for cybercriminals. In theory, an attacker could host malicious code at the target URL in order to infect vulnerable servers, but a well-maintained network could prevent such an attack at the network level. More broadly, there’s no indication that the method could lead to any broader compromise of Apple or Tesla’s systems. (Neither company responded to an email request for comment by time of publication.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="luPhIQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Log4Shell is all the more serious for being relatively easy to exploit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCQW3"&gt;Still, it’s a reminder of the complex nature of technological systems, which almost always depend on code pulled in from third-party libraries. The Log4Shell exploit affects an open-source Java tool called log4j which is widely used for application event logging; though it’s still not known exactly how many devices are affected, but researchers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1469289471463944198"&gt;estimate that it is in the millions&lt;/a&gt;, including obscure systems that are rarely targeted by attacks of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQiQpw"&gt;The full extent of exploitation in the wild is unknown, but in a blog post, digital forensics platform Cado reported detecting servers trying to &lt;a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/analysis-of-initial-in-the-wild-attacks-exploiting-log4shell-log4j-cve-2021-44228/"&gt;use this method to install Mirai botnet code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhBv95"&gt;Log4Shell is all the more serious for being relatively easy to exploit. The vulnerability works by tricking the application into interpreting a piece of text as a link to a remote resource, and trying to retrieve that resource instead of saving the text as it is written. All that’s necessary is for a vulnerable device to save the special string of characters in its application logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHVHwX"&gt;This creates the potential for vulnerability in many systems that accept user input, since message text can be stored in the logs. The log4j vulnerability was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/minecraft-and-other-apps-face-serious-threat-from-new-code-execution-bug/"&gt;first spotted in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; servers, which attackers could compromise using chat messages; and systems that send and receive other message formats like SMS clearly are also susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XeiN5"&gt;At least one major SMS provider appears to be vulnerable to the exploit, according to testing conducted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. When sent to numbers operated by the SMS provider, text messages containing exploit code triggered a response from the company’s servers that revealed information about the IP address and host name, suggesting that the servers could be tricked into executing malicious code. Calls and emails to the affected company had not been answered at time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2llowl"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"&gt;update to the log4j library&lt;/a&gt; has been released to mitigate against the vulnerability, but patching of all vulnerable machines will take time given the challenges of updating enterprise software at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal Control won’t be coming to macOS Monterey until sometime this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8T_kPXe_J0aSmUGfYN4cUfZWmvc=/0x8:1630x1095/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_7.37.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vpqLBu"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt; has been delayed again, with the company’s website updating today to note that the drag-and-drop feature won’t be arriving until sometime “this spring,” as spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleSWUpdates/status/1470468525613539334"&gt;the AppleSWUpdates Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIpYIX"&gt;Universal Control was originally announced alongside macOS Monterey and iPadOS 15 at WWDC back in June, but the feature — which promises to bridge Apple’s Mac and iPad devices, allowing users to use a single mouse and keyboard for both and to drag and drop content between the two — has yet to materialize in either macOS or iPadOS. Apple hasn’t even started offering Universal Control to developers or beta users to test yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kNcuje"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Nh2JJn"&gt;Apple had previously updated its website in October to indicate that Universal Control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733044/macos-universal-control-later-this-fall-monterey-feature-delay"&gt;would be available “later this fall,”&lt;/a&gt; but with the official end of fall just a few days away, it seems that the company is no longer going to hit that estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1oyk3J9lwYF7uL2j0OVs-ksrusQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085160/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_2.14.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mLD03M"&gt;Universal Control isn’t the only major feature to have missed the initial release for Apple’s 2021 software updates. SharePlay, one of the company’s marquee software features this year, wasn’t available at the launch of either iOS 15 or macOS Monterey (the feature only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;arrived on iOS on October 25th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-macos-monterey-12-1/"&gt;just hit macOS today&lt;/a&gt;), while other more minor features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;also failed to make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alpha Motor’s EV designs look cool, but will they ever get made?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSrFB5r8MLLvbPo-0MRrV_bi1Vs=/264x0:3075x1874/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70266185/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_9.57.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alpha Motor Ace electric coupe design.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Alpha Motor Corporation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xcZOwG"&gt;Alpha Motor Corporation is nominally an electric vehicle startup. It has spent the last year pumping out &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/12/secretive-new-ev-startup-unveils-alpha-wolf-electric-pickup-truck/"&gt;retro-futuristic design&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/alpha-motor-ace-electric-car-urban-vehicle/"&gt;retro-futuristic design&lt;/a&gt;, one of which just won the award at this year’s LA Auto Show &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/la-auto-show-announces-the-zevas-award-winners-301425130.html"&gt;for best electric coupe&lt;/a&gt;. But for every new vehicle design Alpha Motor Corporation has released, there are more questions left unanswered. How is the startup funded? What are its plans to build these vehicles? What exactly &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;Alpha Motor Corporation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFqYGX"&gt;Bengt Halvorson at &lt;em&gt;Green Car Reports &lt;/em&gt;put up a mighty effort trying to &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1133401_confusion-brews-as-retro-style-ev-startup-alpha-motor-turns-on-the-charm"&gt;track down some of those answers in August&lt;/a&gt;. He found some, sort of — it appears that the startup was founded, and perhaps funded, by the same person (or people behind) another EV startup called Neuron, which had ties to China but disappeared from the US startup scene as quickly as it arrived. (Alpha Motor says there’s no relationship.) But he also turned up even more questions, like: why are two auto show baristas apparently moonlighting as Alpha Motor’s spokespeople? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8Wj0T"&gt;Those two men — Joshua Boyt and Jay Lijewski — now say they are full time Alpha Motor employees. Boyt is the head of business development, and Lijewski the head of marketing. I recently spent about 35 minutes talking to them via video call in an attempt to answer some of the questions Halvorson (and, in May, former &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/505010/what-we-know-alpha-motor/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt; reporter Gustavo Ruffo&lt;/a&gt;) tried to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9GsA9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yet another mysterious EV startup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MzxAd8"&gt;Boyt and Lijewski made a few admissions. They said the startup does not currently have any drivable prototypes and that there is no parent company above the Alpha Motor corporate entity registered in Delaware. But they remained tight-lipped about pretty much everything else — funding, the size of the team, or why Alpha Motor shares a registered address with Neuron EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNV7J9"&gt;Boyt said they’re “really not trying to do anything that confuses or misleads people,” and that they are just trying to build a “different kind of company.” Considering how many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820435/lucid-motors-sec-investigation-spac-merger-churchill"&gt;well-funded EV startups have found themselves under investigation&lt;/a&gt; for potentially overpromising or misleading investors, maybe that’s the safer move when there’s still billions of dollars flowing into the space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RafnVP"&gt;Playing the “mysterious EV startup” can sometimes help capture some of that money. But so far, Alpha Motor is demonstrating there’s a razor-thin line between being properly cautious and intentionally muddy about what, exactly, the new company is up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qXlmq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5nQ0k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I, like many people, have seen a lot of the designs that Alpha has put out. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make it to the LA Auto Show, but I saw you guys won one of the awards there. There’s obviously a lot of attention on the startup in some ways. So I just want to know more about what’s going on. I know that there’s not a lot of information about the origins of this startup, how it plans to execute on any of the things that we’ve seen. So I’m just looking for more answers on all that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e62tvG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Boyt:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure. Well, I mean, obviously, a lot of what we’re doing is intentional. I mean, we definitely put a lot of thought and care into everything that we do, as kind of expressed in the designs that have been put out. Our real goal, again, is just creating cars we think people will love. And we want to create a different kind of company. I mean, there’s a lot of people in this space kind of moving within historically... traditional methods, especially in terms of automotive, and we really just want to be a different kind of company. And so, for that reason, we’ve been a lot more strategic on what kind of information we share, how we release our vehicles and when. But again, it’s all meant for a specific purpose, to make sure that we are in control of what it is that we... the narrative is, and what it is we do as we develop a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EEeIB6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we really just want to be a different kind of company”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jFXpVO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, and there’s a couple of different ways to go about building a company. Especially at this stage of the timeline. We could have chosen to remain extremely stealth and not put any vehicles out until we were ready to go. Vehicle designs, that is. But we decided to put as much information, vehicle designs, design ethos out there as we could simply because we can. And we can’t help ourselves but put these vehicle designs out there to see what the public is interested in. That can help us steer the company’s trajectory, kind of knowing what people will like before we get to the production phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjoPrj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Is the company something you guys joined that was already in process? Or is it something that you two created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jDMwv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, we so we joined when the company was already formed. Like many folks, I personally fell in love with a particular design that Alpha put out months ago — it was the Jax, I fell in love with the Jax — and at that particular time, I was working on an online event that was meant to serve as a humanitarian effort to raise awareness on the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfyktN"&gt;So I was working on this project to just kind of change the narrative on what people know and think about the country of Yemen. And I had noticed after falling in love with the Jax that Alpha... our mission here is “move humanity.” And at that particular time, Alpha was trying to share their platform for causes just like the Yemen project that I was working on. And so I sent an email to [Alpha] and they picked it up and they shared it on their platform, and I was really impressed by that. And so that started a natural kind of organic conversation and me and Joshua had some in-depth talks with the team at Alpha and we joined, what about four months ago, Joshua?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eVNowI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were just drawn by the design”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z9z46U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, formally I think it was around September, I believe. But we’ve been involved with the project for some time. And obviously, same thing. We were just drawn by the design. We worked in automotive for some some time as well and [have] done a lot of things in marketing and different support in our career. And we’ve always been enticed by the idea of mission, and companies that are driven by heart and driven by a bigger objective than just monetary return. And I think it’s pretty evident as we worked with the team and met with everybody there that the goal really is to just... is part of creating an ecosystem, not just really great cars, which obviously is something, but connecting people and the way that we live, and using our platform, again, to create visibility for philanthropic uses and for connectivity. I think that’s a very admirable trait about the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alpha Motor Wolf pickup truck design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MEQrTl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;And the other piece is I think there’s a lot in the strategy that we’ve learned working with the company of really not trying to do anything that confuses or misleads people. Like, we really want to stick to a strategy of being very confident and cautious because we don’t want to build hype. Like nothing we’ve done... even, you mentioned the award, winning the award [at the LA Auto Show], we’ve not promoted anything. And I mean, we’ve got between like, two of our posts of cars that we launched, we have over a million views on YouTube. Because we’re focusing on the things that we love, we’re focusing on products that we think people will love, and building a great company. So I think that ambition is really proving itself. Being a little bit more strategic on how we’re revealing information, again, is because we don’t want to be self promoting. We don’t want to be marketing ourselves, so to speak, but really just kind of leaving an open door for people to access information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbmyr2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we can’t reveal everybody that’s involved”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zi9aR3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned the team at Alpha a couple of times. Who is the team at Alpha?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lolNSp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;We have a pretty good group, for reasons of where we are as a company, we can’t reveal everybody that’s involved. Some of that information is public knowledge on the internet. We’ve seen a couple posts recently of people mentioning some of the team members, but unfortunately, we can’t reveal everybody that’s involved right now, but as we do get to that spot, we’ll definitely make sure you guys know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnCHLp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you say how big the team is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZBA5a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;How big the team is? Um, I can’t. It’s... we’ve got a lot of people that are working in different departments, obviously, PR, business development, engineering. We’ve just recently been putting a bunch of stuff out about our design centers and our battery, extended life batteries that we’ll be using for mobile use. The team’s working hard on a lot of stuff. But again, yeah, we can’t really...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRS13e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;The individuals who are in a spot where they can share their involvement with the company, they’re all on LinkedIn right now. We’re all on LinkedIn, and the folks who are not listed that are on the team, it’s for reasons, you know, that... I’m sure you understand the startup phase, there’s a lot of hustle and scrappy nature of building a startup that it just makes it... that’s the way it is right now. But when the time is right, you guys know exactly who’s on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="9luyCb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we are just begging for people to be patient with us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hsPve7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve seen there’s a lot of companies out there, a lot of companies that are in the startup phase, a lot of companies that are bringing different things to market and all that, and I think we’ve tried to be very objective and step back and look at the strategies of other companies... And the problem I think a lot of times that happens when the push is for... whatever the motivation in a startup is, whether it’s monetary or whatever, it can change a company’s trajectory. And we’re so committed to being a different kind of company and having something that we can establish and carry many, many years into the future, we don’t want to open up too much. We don’t want [there] to be any deviation from that mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf5YM6"&gt;So it’s difficult because obviously we understand the game we want to play, and communicate, and we know the importance of media and everyone involved. But we’re so confident in what it is we’re building, we are just begging for people to be patient with us because... I mean, the result is happening. The response has just been incredible from the cars that we’re producing. We couldn’t be more excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWdMFe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve used a couple different words to describe the stuff that you’ve been working on, so I want to be absolutely clear about this. You say the cars that you’re “producing,” and you’ve talked about the vehicles that you’re “designing.” What is actually being done at Alpha Motor right now? Are you designing vehicle designs that you hope to produce if you feel they’re popular enough? Are you actually trying to start producing something that looks like one of those cars? What is actually happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfPubG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;All of the vehicles that we have released are in production process. In our production process. Every one of those is within our production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx8lyy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what does that mean, just so I’m clear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y92p1d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, it just means that they’re all at varying degrees of the production process, but they are all in development. For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3eFOW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s an incredible lift. I mean, we have EV startups, even large automotive companies, that are spending billions of dollars to just get the first electric vehicle out the door.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTzI4h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, right. Yeah. And the timeline obviously is different on all of those. But again, you know, we... our goal really is to try and make sure that our process again is very intentional. We’re putting out, at the phases where we can, every single vehicle that there is out there, like I don’t know if you’ve got a chance to see, but the Wolf is in a different part of the production process where we have the non-drivable prototype that right now you can see at the Petersen [Automotive] Museum. So the timelines vary on on all of these vehicles, but every single one of them is in production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t0ZmpO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re in a very delicate phase”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JJnb14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering the financial lift that would be involved in attacking that, even if you have them spaced out over a couple of years, how is the startup funded?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmtRrr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuT4XY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;We can’t really get into that at the moment. We’re in a very delicate phase when it comes to that aspect of the company which, you know, also informs the slow release of a lot of information. What we can share at this time is that we are working on putting out as many vehicle designs as we can, we’re fleshing out not only the the vehicle lineup, but the accessory lineup, even the concept for our retail locations down the road. We’re really trying to be on the ready for every aspect of our business, so that when it is go time, we’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ycq8N"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGELzaE6ZTc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jlmtG3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask one more question, and then I’ll follow up on some of that. On paper, the startup is headquartered in Delaware, registered through Delaware. Is that part of the company, Alpha Motor US — is that where it stops or is there a parent company somewhere else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoGI5t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s where it starts — that’s where it stops. We’re based in Irvine, California. We are a private entity at the moment. Our team is very hard at work on many aspects of the company and [laughs] that’s where we’re at at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLRLJN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;And again, I know all that information that is public knowledge is fine, and we want people to be able to know that stuff. We’ve even... any of those more detailed questions. We actually just recently posted a FAQ on our website that goes through any of this kind of information that you might be interested in as well. So definitely feel free to check that out on the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCed4s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got it. I know you don’t want to talk about individuals. You said there are people on LinkedIn who have the company name out there as far as who their employer is, but can you say who some of the executives are who run the company? Who it was that founded the company? Because you said earlier that you guys aren’t trying to do anything that confuses or misleads people, but that kind of information usually comes out with startups that are trying to raise money and exist in the real world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxR9UB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;And I guess that’s the thing is, we’re not necessarily putting out there that we’re like trying to raise money or we’re trying to do this. What we’re trying to do is just build our company, and I know everybody wants to know exactly what phase we’re at and when, and that’s the difficult part because media really, really wants to pull all those details out for other people that potentially would want to get involved. But again, we’re not trying to do things the way everyone else does. And I know that seems frustrating, and I can feel it. We talk to a lot of media about this. But again, we really just want to continue doing what we’re doing. I mean, that’s the reason that we are a privately held company. We’re doing our process, and we feel very, very confident that what we’re doing is going to create a different kind of company. And so we’re doing everything we can to reveal... again, if you wanted to look at any of that information about the name of the founder is Edward Lee, that’s public knowledge, that’s posted online, that’s in &lt;a href="https://www.alphamotorinc.com/faq"&gt;our FAQ as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQPfTy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;And our vice chair is Jada Lee, she’s our vice chair and counsel for the company. That’s the leadership team right there. I am the head of marketing and Joshua’s the head of business development. There are more folks on the team, of course, but you know, again, they’re not ready to divulge that info at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkjkza"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;But again, we really want to help people get to know us as a company. And that doesn’t necessarily only come by introducing the individuals. We really want to be the kind of company that shows how we operate, the kind of energy and heart that’s put behind our designs, the things that we want to support. I mean, obviously we’re trying to do things like getting connected with the &lt;a href="https://www.alphamotorinc.com/movehumanity"&gt;Michael J. Fox Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and promoting some different things we can using the visibility of our company. We’re excited about that. We’re excited that we know the attention that we’re getting, the reviews on YouTube, through social media, all that, that we can use that for good. And so that’s really what we’re focused on right now. All the rest of it, it’ll be, as things come out, obviously everyone will be excited in that time that it is, but yeah, we just want to put our attention on the things that we know we can utilize for good right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jax electric crossover SUV design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ukwkug"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re accepting preorders for some of the vehicles though, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qdqbv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Not monetarily. We’re taking reservations as a way to get in the queue. In due course, once we develop or further our timeline, we will get into fully refundable cash deposits. But we’re not at that point in our timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc3Abk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel any obligation to those people who have expressed enough interest to sign up to share more information than you already have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdqC95"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;I mean, I think people are excited enough about what we have going on to want to reserve those vehicles, they’re on that journey with us and their excitement is right there with us. And us being able to bring more vehicles to the table, we think that will support different people in different seasons of life or different phases. Like we just released the Saga — being able to have a four-door sedan option is really awesome. We’re excited about that. We actually teased another model that’s coming up soon as well. So these are the kind of things we’re trying to create — cars, like you said that people will love, that will fit in within people’s lifestyle and that helps to kind of continue our process on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G9FQ9D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Alpha Motor doesn’t have any drivable prototypes yet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xS4sCz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;And we certainly are interacting with folks who have shared their interest in our vehicles and will continue to do so. Finding unique and clever ways to interact with these folks and have them interact with our vehicles in a way before they’re actually physically produced. So we’re working on that for sure. And we don’t take that excitement lightly. You know, the love that has been given to us by people who are already in the reservation queue, it puts a lot of wind in our sails, and yeah, it definitely encourages us to keep going and to push through all the heavy lifting that a startup will endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uaQ903"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One last thing on the different models just so I’m clear. You said there is one at the Petersen Museum that’s not drivable but is built out. What about the other ones? Do you have drivable prototypes of any of the other vehicles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxQHdh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;No, not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZILoj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Not currently, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vKhTg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. And how — obviously, like you’ve said, I think it’s pretty obvious that there has been a positive reaction to a lot of the designs — how deep into the functional side of those designs that you’re creating have you gone? Are these CAD modeled exterior and interiors that look really good, but the sort of internals of these theoretical vehicles don’t exist, or are we talking like down to the battery pack, you’ve actually done the work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr9snD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, Sean, you’re asking really good questions definitely into our processes. And unfortunately, that’s one of those things that we can’t share specifics around. But again, like anybody that is familiar with what it takes to make visuals like we do, you probably will understand the amount that goes into that. We definitely are investing a lot of care in the cars that we release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sVVjO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;And you know, we will say this, the folks on our team, design, engineering, and beyond, are extremely well-versed in what it takes to actually bring vehicles to the market. So I think your answer is enveloped in that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQoTqp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. You mentioned some of the other things that have been written recently. One thing that I’m obviously curious about, that a lot of people have been curious about, and I know that the company has been very particular in expressing what it sees as the facts of the situation are, this apparent closeness to another company that had sort of come and gone, called Neuron. I see that Alpha has released statements saying that there is no relationship but there are obvious overlaps, as far as addresses registered to these businesses, and things like that. What is going on with Neuron?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAyjnP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;We’re not associated with that at all. Alpha is a completely different company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40082j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it just a strange coincidence that you wound up with the same registered address?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBNrhs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Um, I have no idea, like it’s not... all I know is that we are completely separate and not connected in any way to that company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaCdFE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that goes for even someone like Edward Lee or other people who are at the top of the company, that they’re separate as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KArkxV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re interested in speaking with Edward about anything in his prior work history, we’ll see what we can do to set up an interview with him, but we can’t speak on Edward’s past. It’s really not our place, but we can assure you that Alpha Motor Corporation is its entirely own entity, privately held, and we’re pushing forward with our mission here at Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3qnND"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah. I mean, if he has availability, I would love to talk to him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQulI1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;Okay, yeah. Shoot us a couple of dates and times that will work for you and we’ll see what we can get on the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lEKhWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We really don’t feel extremely beholden to justify what we are doing at Alpha at this stage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wllXus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you release more designs, what should people be looking for as far as trying to get a sense of how you’re actually going to succeed as a startup? Like, what kinds of things are you going to start showing people as evidence that you’re going to be able to build these vehicles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ML8QO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that people will start to see the natural progression of seeing vehicles. I mean, we will have driving prototypes. We will have cars that will drive on the road. We will produce cars. I think that it’s all going to happen as expected. Again, we’re not trying to over promise and under deliver. What we want to do is just stick to doing what we know, is how it works. Like Jay mentioned, our team is versed in bringing vehicles to market, is versed in doing everything from design, engineering, production, all of those pieces. And so we really just want to make sure that we’re being — again, we’re not giving people something that they’re hanging on, “Oh you said this date and that,” or whatever. We really are trying to just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsen93"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;We really don’t feel extremely beholden to justify what we are doing at Alpha at this stage. Yeah, we’re having very detailed conversations with folks who will provide resource, but as far as those kinds of detailed conversations... we’re not having them with the general public or, frankly, with the media at this time. But we will feel responsible for sharing a lot more of that detail when we get into the phase of accepting cash deposits for vehicles because that will signal that the pathway is clear for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVQAUf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Alright. Well, I appreciate you guys shedding as much light as you’re able to on this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwTog4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Quick question for you before we get off. What got you interested in Alpha? What got you interested in talking to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU8gcj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lack of information around some of the specifics. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iJudfT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Didn’t like any of the designs or anything? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oupnqu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The designs are great, but I’ve been covering this industry for a while now, and not to try and compare your designs to other people’s designs, but we’ve seen a lot of designs. And we’ve seen a lot of companies struggle to come up with the vast resources that are required to, like I said, execute on even one of those designs. And even armed with those resources, are often running into trouble [getting past] the sort of general blockers that stop a lot of companies from ever succeeding in this space. Even a company like Tesla has skirted quite close to death multiple times. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGAcgX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;Totally. We definitely are excited about what we’re doing, and I hear that, and I know there’s a lot of people that want to see EV take its place in the world, and we’re about that. We are about this mission, understanding that EV is the future. We really believe in the direction of our company and the process that we’re taking. I know that it’s hard and I know your job is one of the hardest ones in trying to give people confidence and comfortability in what is a new market. There’s so much market potential. You know what I mean? The EV market is still so small compared to internal combustion engine, and a lot of that is people being afraid of what stepping into that future looks like. Do we have infrastructure? Do we have all these things? And it’s going to take a lot of people working together to get us to that space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ieq0yP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;The folks are either afraid of the lack of infrastructure, or they just haven’t really found an EV design that really resonates with them. And I think that’s a very unique thing that we offer at Alpha, is a different take on the design ethos of EVs. The visceral reaction that people are getting when they’re looking on these vehicle designs, whether they’re posted on our website, our Instagram, or even someone like &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend&lt;/em&gt;’s website or Instagram, they’re getting an insane amount of interest. Again, that puts a lot of wind in our sails, and that pushes us to fulfill this mission. We’re definitely on track and we’re up for the challenge. We completely understand the potential pitfalls and difficulties that are out in front of us, and we know that it’s going to be an uphill battle, but we’re very confident that we’ll be able to see it through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UulCnX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you one last question on that design piece of this. Because I think certainly a lot of people would agree that automakers could stand to have some fresh competition on the design side. Some have sort of gone out of their way recently to try to stand out from the crowd. But a lot of what drives modern vehicles toward looking like each other and gives these companies trouble in sort of making vehicles that stand out and have really radical designs is that they’re developing vehicles with stringent federal safety standards in mind, efficiency targets that they have to hit, working around the current physical and sort of chemical restrictions of battery technology, when we’re talking about electric vehicles. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TGgnB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of all of that goes into the process of coming up with these vehicle designs that Alpha Motor has put out, or are you just leveraging the ability and the freedom of maybe not having to answer those questions just yet, and sort of being able to flex design muscles because you’re not really fitting inside the box you might eventually have to fit in? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIxfjc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyt: &lt;/strong&gt;All those things are in consideration. We want to make vehicles that we’re actually going to produce. They’re not just cool designs. They’re not just drawings on paper, either. Our goal is to make vehicles that will be vehicles that people can drive. [Also] vehicles we love, like we want to drive them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lmKvTf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lijewski: &lt;/strong&gt;I think our designs are unique, but I don’t think that they’re necessarily radical in terms of a lot of the testing that will have to be done. I don’t think that we’re introducing any sort of design that is new to the verifying agencies. I think we’re taking an approach of tapping into what people have always loved about cars, and not trying to give people our take on the future. I think that’s a key differentiator. We take all that into account. And like I said earlier, the folks on our team are extremely well versed in what it takes to not only design cool-looking vehicles, but what it takes to bring those vehicles to the market. You can underline that because I think that’s very important to share. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should now be able to download iOS 15.2&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NjCL3h"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15.2, which includes a ton of features and fixes, has started to become roll out to iPhones after an extensive beta period. According to Apple’s release notes, posted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2-watchos-8-3-and-tvos-15-2-to-all-users/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/apple-releases-ios-15-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the update includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="txvrW9"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774873/apple-digital-legacy-program-comes-to-ios15-iphones-macs"&gt;The Digital Legacy program&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22812264/digital-legacy-death-estate-google-apple-how-to"&gt;designate who gets access to your data&lt;/a&gt; when you die&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1i2stA"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22749352/apple-app-privacy-report-ios-15-2-beta-feature"&gt;The App Privacy Report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what permissions your apps use, and what websites they connect to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TqxDX0"&gt;Apple’s $4.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822631/apple-music-voice-plan-ios-15-2-release-candidate"&gt;voice-only plan for Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Jr09g"&gt;A fix for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778650/apple-iphone-13-pro-beta-macro-mode-button-auto-switching"&gt;somewhat confusing state of the 13 Pro’s macro mode&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2XMGjZ"&gt;The update also brings with it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;some of Apple’s communication safety features&lt;/a&gt;, one of which will blur iMessages sent to children that an on-device scan tags as potentially being explicit. The feature was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;Apple’s controversial suite of changes&lt;/a&gt; meant to fight child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which involved on-device scanning of photos uploaded to iCloud, as well as automatically notifying parents if their child chose to view pictures tagged as inappropriate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ItxICe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="kb2zI4"&gt;Apple has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed the photo library scanning feature&lt;/a&gt; and has made it so that children get to choose whether to notify their parents. iOS 15.2 also brings changes to Safari and Siri that will redirect users to resources if they search for topics related to CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpg3CG"&gt;The update also includes Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824733/apple-iphone-part-service-history-ios-15-2"&gt;new parts and service history feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can show you which parts on your device have been replaced and whether the job was done using genuine Apple parts. Apple says that the iPhone XR, XS, and SE second-gen will show if your battery was replaced and that the iPhone 11 and up will also show if your display has been replaced. The iPhone 12 and 13 models will be able to show info about camera replacements as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsjGrg"&gt;The repair history will show up in Settings &amp;gt; General  &amp;gt; About, under the name and software version section. If you haven’t replaced the battery, screen, or camera on your phone, it won’t show up, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212878"&gt;Apple’s support document&lt;/a&gt; for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCRjka"&gt;To download iOS 15.2, go to Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Software Update. As usual, it can take a moment to roll out to everyone, so if you don’t see it you may want to check back in after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qY1oWF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 13th, 3:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added info about repair history info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s 2021 music recap says it’s getting even better at creating billion-listen megahits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3Xavq_yGCAkcBQaNmfEWKgByYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265996/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pBzv5R"&gt;TikTok says that around 430 songs exceeded 1 billion video views on the platform this year, three times as many songs as last year, as noted in &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-report-2021"&gt;2021’s Year on TikTok Music Report&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most popular songs in this bracket garnered around or above 20 billion views in videos that use them as soundtracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1gB4cK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over 175 trending TikTok songs made it to the Billboard Hot 100 this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xxWQ1W"&gt;TikTok’s yearly recap also includes some numbers on how these songs performed when not attached to a TikTok video. Over 175 trending TikTok songs made it to the Billboard Hot 100 this year, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-2020"&gt;up from 90 in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok also takes credit for helping a number of artists skyrocket themselves to stardom, like ex-Verizon employee Tai Verdes, who made it to the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with his trending TikTok song “A-O-K.” Another emerging artist on TikTok, PinkPantheress, racked up “hundreds of millions of combined streams” on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFS2nT"&gt;The most popular artists on the platform come as no surprise — Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat landed in the number one and two spots, respectively, echoing the leaderboard from last year. Rapper Popp Hunna was the third most popular artist this year, a spot previously held by Pop Smoke. Meanwhile, “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Masked Wolf, “Beggin’” by Maneskin, and “Adderall (Corvette Corvette)” by Popp Hunna took the top three spots as the most popular songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulQpLu"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-2021-us"&gt;TikTok also debuted its yearly roundup&lt;/a&gt; of the most popular videos on the platform. This time around, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@totouchanemu/video/6990181852803894533"&gt;@totouchanemu’s video&lt;/a&gt; of himself dancing — which was shot with a drone — was the most viral video on the platform with 43.9 million views. An &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chipmunksoftiktok/video/6975140587196517638"&gt;adorable video of a chipmunk&lt;/a&gt; stuffing its face with nuts from @chipmunksoftiktok was the second most popular, while &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_catben_/video/6959661816582622469"&gt;@_catben_’s oddly satisfying video&lt;/a&gt; of restocking various household products took third place. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21827432/bella-poarch-tiktok-top-viral-video-2020-420doggface208-jason-derulo-savage-love"&gt;Bella Poarch’s “M to the B” lip sync was the most viral&lt;/a&gt; video on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases Android app to help find sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KY4BEXF4EvnZH2A-B3nMIj0kPB0=/0x56:566x433/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265952/Screen_Shot_2021_12_13_at_11.13.48.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracker Detect works on Android 9 and above.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hnHV3z"&gt;Apple has released an app called Tracker Detect, which the company says will let Android users search for AirTags or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;other Find My-compatible trackers&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Chipolo One Spot tracking tag (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-launches-airtags-and-find-my-detector-app-for-android-in-effort-to-boost-privacy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the app, it looks for devices that have been separated from their owners — if it finds any, it will let you play a sound on it so you can locate it, and it will give you instructions on how to figure out who the AirTag belongs to and how to disable it if need be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drdQju"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;announced that this app was coming in June&lt;/a&gt;, promising that it would allow Android users to find potentially malicious trackers being used without their knowledge. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;Unlike on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, though, it doesn’t seem like this app will constantly do scans in the background and alert you if something is up — it’s purely a manual search. Tracker Detect also doesn’t help you keep track of the AirTags attached to an Apple account, so it’s not helping Android users actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; AirTags.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YdF_fcB-zP5g6_1OrmVltlHAPow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085120/Screenshot_20211213_133032.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can run a manual scan with Tracker Detect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zFc8wj"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but told &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that the app “gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge. We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhVEWl"&gt;For at least two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers, Tracker Detect didn’t show up in a Play Store search on our devices. However, you can install it by &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect"&gt;following this link to its store page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is selling PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEAPQKgxo17PSg21TNBCvbqwM5U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265886/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wpWwfJ"&gt;If you haven’t been able to secure a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, you might be in luck. Walmart is opening orders for Sony’s &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=VergePS5WalmartRestrock121321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 Disc Edition&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1219877/9383?subId1=VergePS5WalmartRestrock121321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; (online only) at 3PM ET today, December 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWRDoK"&gt;Several previous drops &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;have been limited to people who pay for its Walmart Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is open to everyone in the US — no extra fees necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g41pi"&gt;Remember, it’s usually the first who gets the worm, but not always. If you miss out on the first wave at Walmart, the retailer usually releases more in 10-minute intervals, with the next being at 3:10PM, 3:20PM, and so forth until it runs out of stock. For your best chance, try reloading the page just a few seconds before 3PM ET, and possibly open up the site or app on your phone using a cellular connection to have another way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T2BM0q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Wdz7DM"&gt;Also, if you don’t get lucky at first, persist! Sometimes, the “add to cart” button will pop up intermittently, so just be patient and watch closely. It’ll only help your chances of securing a console if you sign in to your Walmart account and ensure that all of your shipping and payment details are set so you can fly through checkout if you get a PS5 or Xbox in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI5wAx"&gt;We’ll add more retailers to this post if any join in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArYNbs"&gt;If all you wanted was the console, well, you’re all set with the links above. But there are several games and accessories you could add to your cart right now that’ll let you have more fun with your PS5 or Xbox Series X when it arrives. Oh, and if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;not sure if we’re in the next generation of gaming yet&lt;/a&gt;, then make sure the first thing you install on your new system is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828860/the-matrix-awakens-ps5-xbox-series-x-free-next-gen"&gt;Epic Games’ impressive (and free) &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt; demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Ypu17y"&gt;Accessories for the PlayStation 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ft8FYf"&gt;If you do manage to secure Sony’s next-gen console, there are a few additional accessories and games we recommend picking up. You’ll find a few of our favorites below, including Sony’s Pulse 3D headset and two notable PS5 exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2H2zmr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="G7fXvi"&gt;Accessories for the Xbox Series X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YjBH3W"&gt;There’s no shortage of accessories available for Microsoft’s Xbox Series X. We’ve highlighted a few of our favorites below, whether you’re looking for a quality headset or a way to burn through &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign without paying $60.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is now selling an Xbox Red Ring of Death poster for $24.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4gkE6HPrMwYDy52lJC5Ca7dVzU4=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265802/rrod.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5VYkaK"&gt;Microsoft is now selling its own Xbox Red Ring of Death poster to commemorate the release of the &lt;em&gt;Power On: The Story of Xbox&lt;/em&gt; docuseries. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjBp_7RuDBUYbd1LegWEJ8g"&gt;six-part documentary&lt;/a&gt; is a warts and all look at 20 years of Xbox highs and lows, including the infamous red ring of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LafMp"&gt;The Xbox 360’s red ring of death was represented by three out of the four LEDs on an Xbox 360 turning red, a problem that affected a lot of initial consoles as failure rates were incredibly high. It indicated a hardware failure, and it meant Xbox 360 owners had to send their console in for repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUe1m1"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2d6IMBS8oY"&gt;chapter five of &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, former Xbox chief Peter Moore reflects on the mistake that cost Microsoft more than $1 billion to fix. “By the time we looked at the cost of repairs, the loss sales that we factored in, we had a $1.15 billion problem,” says Moore. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LxAUzK-I95sdE2CwCgDMNquOpIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085081/PowerOn_HERO1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On documents the 20-year history of Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wxZ9Xi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/collections/power-on-the-story-of-xbox-premium-prints/products/red-ring-of-death-premium-poster"&gt;The Red Ring of Death poster is $24.99&lt;/a&gt;, which won’t go very far in making up the $1 billion loss, but I’m sure those who worked on Xbox 360 would never have imagined Microsoft would be selling a poster about the failure more than 15 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K8Ij4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; also documents the origins of the first Xbox, released 20 years ago, featuring interviews with those who helped bring it to life. Even former Xbox chief Don Mattrick makes an appearance in the docuseries, discussing the Xbox One launch and the problematic focus on TV, Kinect, and always-connected digital approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edulEz"&gt;If you’re interested in the history of Xbox or video games in general, &lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt; is certainty worth a watch. While it’s created by Microsoft, the company doesn’t shy away from acknowledging its failures, the strong Sony competition, and its impressive achievement of creating a new game console. &lt;em&gt;Power On: The Story of Xbox&lt;/em&gt; is available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redbox.com%2Fondemand-tvshows%2Fpower-on-the-story-of-xbox&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2F22832667%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-red-ring-of-death-poster-power-on-docuseries" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Redbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjBp_7RuDBUYbd1LegWEJ8g"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://s.majornelson.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=98119&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2FB09MXLNXVT&amp;amp;dtb=1"&gt;IMDbTV,&lt;/a&gt; The Roku Channel, &lt;a href="http://s.majornelson.com/Proxy.ashx?TSID=98119&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fseason-1%2F8d6kgwxn5t5q%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab"&gt;Microsoft Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/a&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series take top slots in US console sales as shortages continue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ipk4eBVu4q0pdiuepHaMLWUzfw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70265536/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="erXrqS"&gt;We’ve heard you: many of you are still trying to secure a new video game system, and we’ve done what we can to help people find them. But now, a year after the “next-gen” PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S consoles debuted, they’re still in short supply — and the same goes for Nintendo’s Switch and Switch OLED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoDHv5"&gt;The retail sales trackers at NPD Group said console hardware sales in November have fallen off by 38 percent to $883 million in November compared to the same month in 2020, which is when the new PlayStation and Xbox launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIFP7w"&gt;That drop comes despite a still-intense desire to obtain the systems, as well as the availability of a new version of Nintendo’s console. This past November, the Switch still dominated sales, and &lt;a href="https://press.nintendo.com/Nintendo-Switch-is-the-Best-selling-Video-Game-Console-in-November-Wit"&gt;the data shows&lt;/a&gt; that, combined, the new and old versions sold 1.13 million units last month, including 550,000 in the week of Black Friday and Thanksgiving. Just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776640/nintendo-switch-oled-sales-october-2021-doug-bowser-interview"&gt;like it was in October&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the system people can actually get, and it has topped sales charts for 35 of the last 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vRbHFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The global chip shortage is a gamer’s nightmare before Christmas ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oEW7wV"&gt;Sony and Microsoft didn’t eagerly uncover detailed sales data, but NPD analyst Mat Piscatella &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1470385101745786882"&gt;confirmed in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that the Xbox Series family came in second in unit sales. Regular and extended availability of the slightly less powerful and much cheaper Xbox Series S likely explains their position in November and might suggest one way for those interested to get into next-gen gaming, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;chip shortage grinch&lt;/a&gt; keeps a tight hold on supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden launches federal effort to make online benefits less painful</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYNhON"&gt;President Biden is expected to sign an executive order on Monday that would make it easier for Americans to access a broad swath of federal services and benefits, like renewing a passport or accessing retirement benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvP1h7"&gt;“This executive order is really focused on how the federal government delivers services to the public and ensuring that we deliver a high quality product to the public,” Neera Tanden, senior advisor to the president, told reporters on a press call on Monday. “So, we looked at the points of greatest friction for people with their government like filing taxes, applying for Social Security benefits, waiting in TSA lines, and focused on ways to reduce that friction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNPjQL"&gt;The executive order streamlines government services that have traditionally been difficult for Americans to access. Many government services, like retirement, force people to interact with several federal agencies at once to receive benefits, creating significant administrative burden on both aid recipients and the federal workforce. A more streamlined system could make it easier for people to receive certain services and benefits, bringing the government closer to the standard of online services from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eAOZ4a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The order targets 36 different “customer experiences” across 17 federal agencies for improvement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MHOXZ"&gt;The White House released a fact sheet detailing the order on Monday, writing that the order targets 36 different “customer experiences” across 17 federal agencies for improvement. In the order, Biden promises to revamp USA.gov, brandishing it as a “digital Federal front door” for people seeking access to government services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0WUkt"&gt;Federal agencies will be required to publicly report their progress in developing and launching these new processes and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NKRgW"&gt;“The Federal Government interacts with millions of people each day and provides vital services during some of the most critical moments in people’s lives,” the fact sheet said. “But too often, people have to navigate a tangled web of Government websites, offices, and phone numbers to access the services they depend on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjPSat"&gt;Outside of retirement and disaster relief, the order also promises “shorter security and check-in lines at airports” and better access to federal student loan management. On Monday’s call, senior White House officials did not go into detail on any new technologies that would be used by the TSA, but Tanden said “biometric scanning” may be something the government decides to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEfRgA"&gt;“[The order] organizes our reform efforts around life experiences, like retiring, having a child, or surviving a natural disaster. Those are moments where people, where individuals, may need to interact with the federal government in a really critical way in that critical moment, but also may need to interact with multiple agencies,” Jason Miller, deputy director for management at the office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Monday. “That’s a process that should be simple and seamless. We’re one enterprise and we should operate accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym2RMA"&gt;The federal government has struggled to make efficient online experiences for Americans seeking benefits, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/8/4814098/why-did-the-tech-savvy-obama-administration-launch-a-busted-healthcare-website"&gt;the Obama administration’s bumpy healthcare.gov rollout&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. At the time, users were unable to make accounts, and others received miscalculated healthcare subsidies. In the wake of that debacle, then-President Obama founded the US Digital Service, which has since launched new systems for Medicare payments and VA discharge forms. The Biden administration’s new order would bring that work to a much greater scale, potentially touching every citizen-facing agency in the federal government in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5D8fj"&gt;“The President is making sure we’re building accountability and transparency into everything we do and that we’re good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” the fact sheet said. “As the President has said: ‘We have to prove democracy still works, that our government still works and can deliver for our people.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IUUHl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vm1NeO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
