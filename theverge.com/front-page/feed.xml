    <title>Tekken’s Kazuya is coming to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ujH8EDOfqTxg9QmVRuSAEmFH5Vc=/209x0:2408x1466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455740/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.02.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTdNPl"&gt;Nintendo has announced that Kayuza from the &lt;em&gt;Tekken&lt;/em&gt; fighting games&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will be the latest character to join &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate &lt;/em&gt;at its E3 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation. Additional details are promised at a future presentation on June 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pompmJ"&gt;The character marks the latest classic fighting game character to join Nintendo’s flagship fighter, joining characters like &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;’s Ryu or &lt;em&gt;Fatal Fury&lt;/em&gt;’s Terry Bogard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8yV0mB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A new Super &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmashBrosUltimate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SmashBrosUltimate&lt;/a&gt; fighter has been revealed! &lt;a href="https://t.co/mjyJQwZ2pX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mjyJQwZ2pX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1404833107413508097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Vq5L"&gt;Kayuza is the fifth DLC character to be added to &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;’s second Fighters Pass. Previous additions included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21298847/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-arms-character-min-min-release-date"&gt;Min Min from &lt;em&gt;Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21495481/steve-minecraft-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-fighter-pass-vol-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; mascots Steve and Alex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; villain Sephiroth&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287114/super-smash-bros-ultimate-new-character-nintendo-switch-dlc-xenoblade-chronicles-2-pyra"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&lt;/em&gt;’s Pyra and Mythra&lt;/a&gt; (the two count as a single character) released in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZLOBo"&gt;The Fighters Pass costs $29.99 for six characters, with a final character — who, barring any changes, will be the last fighter added to &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; — who should be announced later this year. Players who don’t want the full collection can also pay $5.99 for each character individually.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nWW50cDO0UFBUomRKJYcJvn8FZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660162/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.03.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wfyw25"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; also still has its original Fighters Pass, which costs $24.99 and includes five additional characters: Joker from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, Hero from &lt;em&gt;Dragon Quest&lt;/em&gt;, Banjo and Kazooie from &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, Terry Bogard from &lt;em&gt;The King of Fighters&lt;/em&gt;, and Byleth from &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 screenshots leak, show new Start menu and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIda8c97yyIU2T603uAsUnv0s4g=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455735/windows10lede.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FBNhCE"&gt;Screenshots of Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 11 operating system have appeared online today. Originally published at &lt;a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/7405731991"&gt;Chinese site Baidu&lt;/a&gt;, the screenshots show off the new Windows 11 user interface and Start menu. The UI changes look very similar to what was originally found in Windows 10X before Microsoft canceled that project in favor of Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVEhrN"&gt;App icons are now centered on the taskbar, with a new Start button and menu. The Start menu is a simplified version of what currently exists in Windows 10, without Live Tiles. It includes pinned apps and the ability to quickly shut down or restart Windows 11 devices. The operating system is identified as Windows 11 Pro in screenshots, and we can confirm they are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cbp_gYpMYYu_jkP06KKXL-gXIv8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660151/windows11_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UjXJDY"&gt;While Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442421/microsoft-windows-10-x-canceled-official"&gt;canceled its Windows 10X operating system&lt;/a&gt;, the company is clearly reusing large parts of that work with Windows 11. Windows 10X was originally designed for dual-screen devices, before shifting towards traditional laptops and then being canceled. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132826/microsoft-windows-10x-features-dual-screen-foldable-hands-on-developers"&gt;Windows 10X included&lt;/a&gt; a number of refined and simplified aspects to Windows, and some of those are present in the leaked screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELKnHw"&gt;Microsoft has been dropping hints that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466394/microsoft-windows-11-launch-teaser-rumors"&gt;ready to launch Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. The software giant is holding a special Windows event to reveal its next OS on June 24th. The event starts at 11AM ET, and the event invite includes a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks like the number 11. Microsoft execs have also been teasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;“next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt; for months, and one even described it as a “new version of Windows” recently. Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528115/microsoft-windows-11-startup-sound-new-teaser-video"&gt;teased Windows 11 during an 11-minute video&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google announces starred messages, emoji mashup suggestions, and more for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A drawing of a person using starred messages to save a text containing a Wi-Fi password" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qQwrYIa_TOIBdUjdUJnryPT7GoM=/250x0:1600x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455668/Untitled_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W7balv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-summer-2021"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; six new features for Android that it says will help improve accessibility and make Assistant Shortcuts more useful, among other things. The new features announced today are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="zJ6ie9"&gt;Android’s Earthquake Alerts are coming to more countries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xvio6R"&gt;Google says its phone-based earthquake detection and alert system will be coming to Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The system, which uses Android phones to create an earthquake detection network that will warn people if they’re in a potentially affected area, originally launched in California, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407676/google-expands-android-earthquake-detection-system"&gt;was made available&lt;/a&gt; in Greece and New Zealand in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLLUeT"&gt;Google says it hopes to bring the feature to more regions over the next year, but that it’s focusing on first making it available to countries that have a high risk of earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EnYDvt"&gt;Starred Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JyxsmQ"&gt;If you get sent a text with important info and want to be able to quickly find it, you’ll be able to “star” it, which will place it in the starred category so you won’t have to scroll back through a conversation to find it. Google says the feature will be rolling out to the Messages app “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpWpNWN8IprNefP67JmbAjvICgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659095/Emoji_kitchen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gboard will suggest your custom emoji creations based on your message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RtEWOV"&gt;Emoji Kitchen recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUzI3"&gt;Starting this summer, Gboard will contextually suggest stickers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21132971/google-emoji-mashups-kitchen-gboard-android-cowboy-monkey-ghost-combination"&gt;created in Emoji Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s tool that lets users create mashups of two different emoji. The suggestions will show up in the Emoji menu for those writing a message in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ji2QTgR5GKHtPRR4g9-mnpmV-ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659110/Screen_Shot_2021_05_17_at_4.05.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-for-io-assistant-tools-and-features.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google uses Strava as an example for the widget view that will be available in Assistant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XTxYQY"&gt;Google Assistant Shortcuts are getting an upgrade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="feUePm"&gt;Google’s Assistant Shortcuts let users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506301/google-assistant-custom-shortcuts-third-party-apps-android"&gt;jump to a specific part of an app&lt;/a&gt;, but developers will now be able to show users information in widget form right in Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utYBHxHA0d7Hawgd-9BSKkCn0PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659138/voice_access_gaze_detect.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tell Voice Input to ignore you if you’re not looking at your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XVqiVw"&gt;Voice Access won’t take your conversations as input&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaF2b4"&gt;Google’s Voice Access app, which allows people to navigate their phones using their voice, is getting gaze detection so it can tell whether someone is talking to their phone or talking to other people. The feature, which is in beta, will stop taking commands if it detects that you’re not looking at your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIvJ40"&gt;Voice Access is also getting improvements when it comes to entering passwords: users will be able to say words like “dollar sign,” and they’ll be translated into the symbol, instead of being written out literally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oHQRDw"&gt;Android Auto gets more customization and creature comforts &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="YLUCnY"&gt;Android Auto users will be able to use their phone to personalize the app launcher and manually manage dark mode. Google’s also adding the ability to quickly scroll to the top of a list, and the scroll bar is getting an A to Z button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66EYoR"&gt;Google also says the messaging experience for apps like Messages and WhatsApp has been improved, making it easier to send and read messages.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest tool in fighting wildfires is homes that won’t burn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The One-Stop Rebuilding Shop For Wildfire Victims" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGnWBzsFB4zy9lp7pn-uFcwgx48=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455666/1228923218.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A home Homebound Inc. is rebuilding stands under construction after it was destroyed in the Tubbs Fire in the Fountain Grove neighborhood of Santa Rosa, California, on September 16th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Michael Short / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Building codes are on the frontlines of California’s fire fight&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="H5sVU9"&gt;With wildfires raging more uncontrollably in the West than they have in the past, experts say it’s time to change the way we fight them. The battle now starts at home, where people live, before a spark ever ignites a flame in a nearby forest or brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8o2ZAI"&gt;Until recently, efforts to keep people and property safe have largely focused on preventing and fighting off wildland blazes where they start. That includes beefing up the firefighting force and managing forests so that dry vegetation doesn’t become tinder for a mega blaze. But that alone won’t be enough as climate change fuels more intense fire seasons each year. Communities now need to adapt to an unstoppable threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yCHhfp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s no longer an assumption we can safely rest upon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hK5qes"&gt;“We are nested in this belief and this assumption that we can domesticate wildfires to the point where we will be safe from it. The reality is that with climate change and the scale, the pace, and the severity with which wildfires are currently burning, that’s no longer an assumption we can safely rest upon,” says Kimiko Barrett, lead wildfire researcher at the nonprofit Headwaters Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etSupP"&gt;Fifteen of the 20 &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/t1rdhizr/top20_destruction.pdf"&gt;most destructive fires&lt;/a&gt; in the state’s history have taken place since just 2015. Last year alone, blazes tore through a shocking 4 million acres of the Golden State, smashing the previous record of roughly 2 million acres scorched in a single fire season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npmL4Z"&gt;“These fires are just reaching a magnitude where we can’t just say we’ll treat the forest and we’ll be okay,” Barrett says. “You have to start bringing the human dimension to this now. What, as a society should we be doing differently in terms of where and how we build?” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LNU Lightning Complex Fire Damage In Vacaville" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUMCHs0g_Goyp4izey3iwXWX8FA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659933/1269479636.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aerial view of burnt-out wreckage along Pleasants Creek Road after the LNU Lightning Complex Fire tore through the area on August 28th, 2020, in Vacaville, California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KSQeDJ"&gt;California has already rebuilt itself in response to another type of disaster: earthquakes. The 6.7 magnitude &lt;a href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/1/17/21068895/los-angeles-earthquake-steel-buildings-getty"&gt;Northridge earthquake was the most recent wake-up call&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. It sparked a rush to change building codes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; upgrade existing structures. Buildings and freeway bridges were reinforced. Los Angeles mandated retrofits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2biSA"&gt;Now, there’s a call to do something similar for fires. It’s getting louder, especially as more people spread out into more rural areas within what’s called the Wildland Urban Interface. While there’s been some finger-pointing at people who decide to live closer to where wildfires burn, some experts warn against blaming those most vulnerable. Housing in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, and even in their surrounding suburbs, is becoming increasingly unaffordable. That forces people out of city centers and closer to where wildfires burn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu1NlC"&gt;“We have a housing crisis,” says Crystal Kolden, a former firefighter who is now an assistant professor at the School of Engineering at the University of California, Merced. For her, asking residents to move to less fire-prone areas is unfair and unrealistic. “We don’t do that for other natural hazards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QyrZnr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a housing crisis.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hUOnuR"&gt;“All the people that are saying, ‘Well, why do people live in these rural fire prone areas?’ are the ones that are sitting on a massive earthquake fault,” she says. “They are the beneficiaries of massive federal and state infrastructure upgrade projects that made those cities less vulnerable to earthquakes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="heL5zX"&gt;California is already ahead of other states when it comes to implementing building standards for fire safety, but there’s a lot of work left to do. Back in 2008, California created a new building code requiring fire-resistant construction. That proved to be a success when the most destructive wildfire in California’s history, the Camp Fire, tore through Butte County in 2018. Over half of the homes built after 2008 stayed standing, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/fires/article227665284.html"&gt;McClatchy analysis&lt;/a&gt;. But most of the homes in the area are older. Of those, far fewer — just 18 percent — were spared from the blaze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pGdug"&gt;In the absence of state-wide mandates for older structures, it’s largely been up to individuals to harden their homes against blazes (although there are stricter standards in some of the most fire-prone areas). Some homeowners have made headlines, like an &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/california-fire-fireproof-home-sonoma-county-kincade-2020-2#downstairs-in-the-basement-the-walls-are-made-with-with-durisol-a-fire-resistant-material-its-filled-with-concrete-and-steel-with-insulation-on-the-outside-so-its-a-foot-thick-arai-said-10"&gt;engineer in Sonoma County&lt;/a&gt; who took 15 years working to fireproof his home — filling his walls and covering his windows with flame-resistant materials. His house was put to the test during the 2019 Kincade Fire that destroyed 374 structures nearby. His home survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rp3O96"&gt;Beyond using materials that don’t easily catch fire (especially for rooftops), property owners can also take care to prevent embers from finding their way inside by replacing vents. Creating a “&lt;a href="https://cafiresafecouncil.org/resources/fire-safety-information-for-residents/"&gt;defensible space&lt;/a&gt;” around a home is also crucial; homeowners should have a buffer zone around their home that’s free from vegetation or other materials that could become dry fuel, &lt;a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/fire/Prepare/Building/"&gt;according to experts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefighters work to defend a home on Pallet Creek Road during the Bobcat Fire in Valyermo, California, on September 18th, 2020. California faces more devastation from wildfires that have ravaged the West Coast, authorities warned, with strong winds and dry heat expected to whip up flames from dozens of blazes raging across the state.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RyRMaT"&gt;Those changes are most effective when they’re widespread. “It cannot be one home alone. It has to be ubiquitous across the neighborhood,” Barrett says. “Voluntary measures don’t work. You could have five neighbors that agreed to mitigate their property but you’ve had that one neighbor [that’s] centrally located and they don’t believe they need to do anything. So, he exposes the rest of his neighborhood to wildfire.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDnyVV"&gt;While some might choose not to make fire-minded improvements, other households might not be able to afford the retrofits needed to keep their home and community safe. “There’s just not the resources to do a lot of the work that we know is effective in reducing wildfire hazards,” Kolden says. “But it is a societal problem, not an individual problem, and that’s why it’s a social justice issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzQyJ6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It cannot be one home alone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nxkFqs"&gt;That makes a state-wide strategy for updating older homes all the more important. State agencies &lt;a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2021/release012-2021.cfm"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in February that they will come up with new standards for homes and communities to “harden” themselves against fire, part of a broader effort to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-california-fires-687a62c8ea82570e26697873322496f1"&gt;make it easier to insure homes&lt;/a&gt;. And a $536 million wildfire prevention bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in April provides some &lt;a href="https://news.caloes.ca.gov/california-sets-framework-for-wildfire-home-hardening-program/"&gt;financial assistance&lt;/a&gt; to residents to start that work on their properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3m35ab"&gt;There still might not be enough funding to reach everyone and keep costs from racking up for lower-income households. In May, Newsom proposed an unprecedented &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Wildfire-and-Climate-Change-Fact-Sheet.pdf"&gt;$2 billion&lt;/a&gt; for wildfire preparedness. But most of the money would still go toward firefighting and forest management. Of that, $40 million is earmarked for retrofitting existing homes. (There’s another $250 million chunk for making communities more resilient to disasters, including wildfires, earthquakes, droughts, and coastal flooding.) In comparison, a wildfire planning strategy outlined in a recent &lt;a href="https://woods.stanford.edu/stanford-wildfire-research/events/new-strategy-addressing-wildfire-epidemic-california"&gt;Stanford white paper&lt;/a&gt; calls for $1 billion a year for home hardening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="k9V3ez"&gt;“I believe state government has recognized the need to incentivize or subsidize or help support communities engaged in retrofitting for safety,” says J. Keith Gilless, dean emeritus of the University of California, Berkeley’s College of Natural Resources and chair of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. “Although, you know, the total magnitude of the problem is huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXyNmh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vxWQo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Podcasts’ in-app subscriptions are now live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1NIPew36OacnTaZaJRZGMDrs4s=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455654/applepodcastsubs.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2vYvy9"&gt;Apple Podcasts now offers in-app subscriptions in more than 170 countries, about a month after the feature was first scheduled to launch. With this feature live, listeners can pay to support shows and networks for access to ad-free content and, in some cases, other perks like early access to episodes. They can also pay for access to a channel, which is basically like supporting a podcast network and applying these paid perks to all the shows it makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6sM8d"&gt;A few big shows and networks are participating at launch. Luminary, which made its name selling subscriptions for its own in-app content, is now selling subs through Apple. NPR also sells ad-free subscriptions, as does Wondery, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byVmZa"&gt;Once people have paid for access, a “Subscriber Edition” label will show up on their feeds to signify that they’re able to hear everything. The process to sign up is seamless; listeners just have to tap a button to subscribe and everything runs through Apple’s built-in payment processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNZh2i"&gt;Apple’s biggest competitor, Spotify, is also eyeing subscription podcasts. In its case, the company hasn’t built an in-app button but rather requires podcasters to link out to an external Anchor webpage where listeners can pay. Of course, other platforms, like Patreon, have also focused on paid podcast content, but bringing the button into the Apple Podcasts app could be potentially huge, as listeners don’t have to struggle to find the place to listen and subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RL5cNM"&gt;That’s the broader promise of the feature: a way to easily allow listeners to pay for podcast content in the place where they’re already enjoying shows. Soon we’ll see how this actually pans out for the podcasters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifT7oR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Swift Playgrounds logo on a white background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8OFD2-zMjYASX-9_-dOLhoZns8=/287x0:1589x868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455595/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Swift Playgrounds, the iPad can finally submit iOS apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IUTRP5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;Apple’s latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is its most powerful tablet yet. And going into WWDC 2021, many viewers (myself included) had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;long wishlists of features&lt;/a&gt; we were hoping we might finally get to see — multiuser support, a more advanced Files app, native support for Final Cut and Photoshop, better compatibility with external displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfbrza"&gt;We didn’t get many of those dream features, but we did get something of a surprise: Apple announced Swift Playgrounds 4, the newest version of its Swift Playgrounds sandbox, a program Apple SVP Craig Federighi claimed will bring “a whole new dimension of productivity to iPad.” It was a quick announcement that was easy to miss in the flurry of new tools that crossed the stage. But developers say it will drastically lower the barrier to entry for new iOS developers — and may gesture at more exciting iPad features to come.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6venNBiU_sDjKIgXXNTrwpXNTCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19716355/Switch_Playgrounds_iPad.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a lesson in Swift Playgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WvFe9G"&gt;Swift Playgrounds isn’t a new app. It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924120/apple-swift-playground-app-teaches-kids-to-code"&gt;available on the iPad for years&lt;/a&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135573/apple-swift-playgrounds-coding-app-available-mac"&gt;recently came to macOS&lt;/a&gt; as well. In the past, though, it’s largely been an educational program targeted at children. It introduces new coders to Swift through a friendly and colorful series of puzzles. It hasn’t, in the past, been seen as a tool to develop real apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Swift Playgrounds 4 on an iPad. Code is on the left side. On the right side is a preview of a simple to-do list app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gwbG9kOa1NKPw4aGHK9kYytNsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659879/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_swiftui_code_completion_060721_big_carousel.jpg.medium.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code on the left, preview on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yGSpnZ"&gt;But Swift Playgrounds 4 is the first iteration of Swift Playgrounds that could function as a standalone developer tool. There are some new features that will make the process of building apps easier. Notably, you can view a live preview of the app you’re building on the side of your screen as you’re working on it, which changes when you change your code. You can run the app full-screen to test it as well. But the biggest news is: not only can you create apps in Swift Playgrounds 4, but when the update is available later this year, you’ll be able to submit them to the App Store directly from within Swift Playgrounds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K9MA0k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Xcode’s powerful, it’s great, but it’s very complicated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KlIR59"&gt;This is a big deal because it allows developers to bypass the long, involved process that’s currently required to distribute software. Apps for the Apple ecosystem are not currently built in Swift Playgrounds or anything nearly as fun and colorful; they’re largely built and distributed in Xcode, a massive and complicated application that only runs on Macs. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17173362/apple-swift-playgrounds-xcode-cliff-ipad-learn-to-code-education"&gt;famously difficult&lt;/a&gt; to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Xcode on a MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C53Ie1PW4TcMMU7VhgzPBfHotqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659901/Annotation_2021_06_15_102739.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an Xcode interface on a MacBook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xEgLiP"&gt;In addition, the process of getting an app from Xcode to the App Store has a &lt;a href="https://instabug.com/blog/how-to-submit-app-to-app-store/"&gt;number of complex steps&lt;/a&gt; and requires a developer account, other programs to be installed, and a whole slew of videos, screenshots, graphics, and other assets to be uploaded to Apple’s platform called App Store Connect. It’s a barrier to entry for new developers. &lt;a href="https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/"&gt;App Store Connect&lt;/a&gt; is a pain in the neck for even professionals to navigate, says Matt Weinberg, co-founder of digital agency Happy Cog, who has been building apps for over 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNKMoU"&gt;“Xcode’s powerful, it’s great, but it’s very complicated,” Weinberg tells me. “There’s a lot of people who have the idea to code, have the idea for an app, and then realize there would be 50 steps on App Store Connect. We do this professionally, and it’s hard for us to even figure out App Store Connect. This will help them really get apps up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwTFqa"&gt;Tucker Haas, co-founder and CEO of the finance app Quo, who has built over a dozen iOS applications, feels similarly: “When I was first learning to program iOS apps over 10 years ago, it was a daunting task full of hurdles just to get the development environment set up,” he tells me. The new Swift Playgrounds, he says, will make things “a hundred times easier for new developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCL4rZ"&gt;Weinberg also thinks the real-time preview feature will help keep new developers engaged. “It’s kind of hard to overstate how big of a deal that is, that you could be writing on your iPad and as you’re writing code you’re getting a preview of your actual app,” he says. “That moment where you write a piece of code and you hit ‘run’ and it works, and you see something, I remember that, and it was 25 years ago. I think Apple is doing a really good job making that moment a lot quicker and a lot easier for people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TUVA0X"&gt;
&lt;p id="NS73Vx"&gt;Developers have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17173362/apple-swift-playgrounds-xcode-cliff-ipad-learn-to-code-education"&gt;calling for an Xcode equivalent for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; for years now, and the reasons why are obvious. As &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;writer Paul Miller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17173362/apple-swift-playgrounds-xcode-cliff-ipad-learn-to-code-education"&gt;argued back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, such a program would give new coders who got their footing through Swift Playgrounds a way to graduate into “true application developers” without having to buy a new device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMwIe8"&gt;iPads are also more affordable than Macs, and Xcode for the iPad could make app development more accessible for small businesses and new developers who want to stick with an iPad as their primary driver. “This is most significant for those learning programming who want to avoid that higher barrier to entry of getting a Mac,” Haas says. “The cost of building a simple utility app and getting it on the App Store has now dropped several hundred dollars.” And even for professional coders, an iPad could be useful as a secondary device for use on the go and for passing around among collaborators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RV7FB1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cost of building a simple utility app and getting it on the App Store has now dropped several hundred dollars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oIsXJS"&gt;But Swift Playgrounds 4 isn’t the big announcement the developer community was waiting for. It has significant limits and lacks several advanced tools — debugging and profiling tools, versioning, storyboard integration, support for third-party packages, etc. “Swift Playgrounds is great for experimenting and debugging code, but it is missing many of the features ... required to make fuller-fledged apps,” Haas explains. He says the program is “perfect for developing small utility applications, such as a to-do list, but currently incapable of building the next Angry Birds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4dTnc"&gt;And for some developers, the convenience of the iPad’s form factor is outweighed by the limitations of its software — which persist, despite the new power of its chips. “Software development is not just code typing,” says Serg Krivoblotsky, technological R&amp;amp;D lead at the software development company MacPaw. “It’s also tons of browsing, reading, quick switching between different tools and applications. All this stuff is still more convenient on the desktop.” And of course, plenty of programs developers use on Macs, like code analyzers, debugging tools, and system profilers, aren’t yet available for iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yI4wTr"&gt;That doesn’t mean Swift Playgrounds 4 is useless to professionals. Many people I spoke to were excited by the real-time preview function, which can help users visualize their code as they’re writing it and present it to clients and collaborators in a more accessible format. Weinberg thinks it might be helpful for real-time brainstorming. “I could easily imagine during prototyping, sitting there with clients, sitting there with partners, and they have some ideas, and us just literally building versions of their ideas,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a simple to-do list and journal app being run as a preview in Swift Playgrounds 4 on an iPad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhapIpALhG0DffwVbQNY_ZxI9Bc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659895/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_swiftui_fullscreen_app_060721_big_carousel.jpg.medium.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a live preview of an app built in Swift Playgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tmfOFN"&gt;“I cannot wait to get my hands on Swift Playgrounds 4,” says Chris Wagner, an engineer at the software agency MartianCraft. Wagner plans to use it to “iterate on features in isolation — that is, write components on iPad and bring them into larger Xcode projects.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="veRC1s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I cannot wait to get my hands on Swift Playgrounds 4.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2hZFFA"&gt;Of course, some professionals may use it for fun. “I could see myself writing an app on the side,” says Cory Bohon, another MartianCraft engineer who uses a Mac for work, but an iPad Pro as his personal device.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPuyx6"&gt;But the most significant thing about Swift Playgrounds 4, to the developers I spoke to, is what it indicates about Apple’s vision for the future of the iPad. To many, it is a hint that coding on iPads is a priority for Apple — and that “Xcode on iPad,” and perhaps a user interface that better complements it, might be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipixXZ"&gt;“I treat the new feature as an important first step towards bringing Xcode to the iPad,” says Vira Tkachenko, CTO of MacPaw. “The talks about Xcode coming to iPad have been going on for a while. It looks inevitable with the M1 processors on Macs, and Apple is gradually laying the groundwork for merging macOS and iOS.” Tkachenko tells me she “can’t wait to see real Xcode on iPad.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VWDGz"&gt;When Apple announced the M1 iPad Pro, I argued that Apple should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;allow the device to run macOS&lt;/a&gt;. After all, the iPad has hardware that makes up for the MacBook Air’s greatest weaknesses, and plenty of Big Sur’s features would take good advantage of its touchscreen capability. And it seems like we’re reaching a point in the evolution of Apple’s hardware where the MacBook can do everything the iPad can do, while the iPad can still only do iPad things (even though plenty of “MacBook” tasks could take good advantage of its unique form factor, hardware, and touchscreen). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a notification that says “Upload Succeeded!” overlaid over a coding interface in Swift Playgrounds on an iPad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPmVtGx4WzcxsXl3QgD7-PqCcXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659890/Apple_iPadPro_iPadOS15_swiftui_submit_to_store_060721_big_carousel.jpg.large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upload succeeded!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QOofEU"&gt;So after watching this keynote and after speaking to the people who use this stuff day in and day out, I’m optimistic. Moving app development to the iPad is a sign that Apple (contrary to its &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ipad-pro-apple-interview-m1-explained-b1835934.html"&gt;own insistence&lt;/a&gt;) is thinking of the iPad in this way. It’s thinking of the iPad as a MacBook alternative. It’s starting to bring over tasks that would never have been possible before. Maybe we can expect Xcode or something similar suited to its form factor. Maybe we can expect an iPadOS better suited to app development down the line. Regardless, it seems like we might see more where this came from — at least, I certainly hope we will.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming headsets to buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UVd9u16rXqTZwykb9t8sVIxO1dM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67799392/acastro_201109_4282_gamingHeadsets_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A few options for each platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZkrThV"&gt;If you’re shopping for a gaming headset, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of options. While there are some great ones out there, it’s easy to pay too much, to accidentally purchase a headset that doesn’t work with your desired console or platform, or to get one that’s just uncomfortable. Knowing a thing or two about headphones &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; aid in your search, but gaming headsets have only gotten more complicated to shop for — especially the wireless ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOIb46"&gt;For instance, wireless headsets made for Xbox operate without a dongle via Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol. They’ll only work on Xbox consoles or a PC that has one of Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapters plugged in, in most cases. Conversely, if you get a multiplatform wireless headset that includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle, it’ll likely work on the likes of the PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (when plugged into the console’s TV dock), and PC — but not Xbox. It’s best to buy the headset that mentions support for your preferred platform(s) explicitly, or else there’s a good chance you’ll run into some compatibility issues. Of course, you can eliminate most of the guesswork by buying a wired gaming headset instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JNU3"&gt;This guide focuses on newer options that you’re more likely to encounter at stores as opposed to older models that, while possibly still being worthy of your money, are often tougher to find affordably and easily online. Also, just to mention it at the top, I have a large-ish head and that factor obviously played a major role in how I judge the comfort of these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKGdzA"&gt;You’ll find a few categories below, including the &lt;strong&gt;best multiplatform wireless headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that are compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch via its dock, the &lt;strong&gt;best Xbox wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the best PlayStation wireless gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;best wired gaming headsets&lt;/strong&gt; that support the widest variety of platforms, from console controllers to phones, tablets, and VR headsets that feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="McEjqN"&gt;Best multiplatform wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt; ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhUUV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch (via its dock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="riIMhm"&gt;The HyperX Cloud II Wireless makes an excellent first impression before even turning it on for the first time. Its headband expands to fit a range of head sizes, and the ear cups rest gently around my ears without nary a pinching feeling around my cranium. The cups can be stretched even further than my head requires, which gives me faith that they’ll be a durable pick for years to come. This is the downfall of many otherwise good gaming headsets. HyperX nailed the fit, and it also aced a lot of other winning elements with the Cloud II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7HwnV"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless boasts a balanced sound that delivers just enough gusto for every scenario. It’s not the right choice if you want bass to rattle your head, but it’s good if you want your headset to be just as enjoyable to use for gaming as it is for music and voice chats. I also like that the Cloud II Wireless has USB-C charging, and its battery life is long-lasting. HyperX claims 30 hours of battery per charge, and the headset lived up to that mark during my testing. The wireless range of the headset and the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver are also great, suffering no drops anywhere in my apartment. It even remained stable when I stood on the other side of a wall or window, each being about 25 feet away from the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iHCKN5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568047" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlqrJU"&gt;Compared to competitors in this price range, the Cloud II plays it simple when it comes to the buttons, and the result is that it’s easy to learn how to master the layout. And if all the functions you require are a volume dial, power button, and a microphone mute button, this will suit you better than other headsets that try to fit too many buttons onto ear cups. On the other hand, it’s missing a game and chat audio mix dial that easily lets you fine-tune your game audio with your pals chatting on Discord or while streaming. You can do this manually by clicking a few windows, but other headsets mentioned below make this easier to do. This headset also makes it easy to turn on mic monitoring to hear yourself talk (and hear things happening around you) by simply holding the mute button to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQCvSA"&gt;The Cloud II Wireless doesn’t have an overwhelming lead over the major players in the space, like Logitech, SteelSeries, and Razer. In fact, it may get the boot if a similarly priced and comparably cozy model with wired 3.5mm connectivity and Bluetooth support comes along. But since that has yet to happen, HyperX’s flagship wireless headset is the easy choice for PC, PlayStation, and Switch gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQibPD"&gt;Here’s what the microphone sounds like on the HyperX Cloud II Wireless:

&lt;p id="a7jGKR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiplatform but requires an extra $20 adapter to work with both PS and Xbox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMAE19hTSmz0CsTc9TF32Tv1bnw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21830232/Aquarius_Blue_Desk_Stage_2_0058.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Astro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SrrIBJ"&gt;Astro’s new A20 for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles is unique in that it’s one of the few cross-platform wireless headsets out there. Buying just one of them (in either the PlayStation blue / white colorway or the Xbox green / white) can let you connect to either system. However, there’s a small catch: you’ll need to buy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional $20 wireless adapter&lt;/a&gt; to let it connect to the console opposite of your headset’s color styling (each headset includes one adapter). Despite the string attached, this functionality makes it an appealing option for people who will be getting both the PS5 and Xbox Series X or S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntDrFp"&gt;Whichever platform you’ll use with this headset, Astro’s A20 Gen 2 is packed with more buttons and features than the Cloud II Wireless above. On the ear cups, Astro managed to also fit in a dedicated button for switching the equalizer to your liking to add or subtract bass and vocal clarity. There’s also a game and chat audio mixing dial to help you find the right balance of sounds between your apps. I love this feature, and I also dig that it has a good amount of mic monitoring, so you can hear a little bit of the outside world. This headset’s microphone doesn’t detach. Instead, you’ll just move it up to mute it, which gets it out of your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4o0BxC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568052" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j1b0Ap"&gt;Astro’s latest headset checks a lot of boxes considering its $120 price. The A20 Gen 2 doesn’t quite reach the comfort of HyperX’s model above, as it hangs most of its weight at the top of your head. It doesn’t get painful as the ear cups don’t pinch, but it can result in some fatigue after a while (on top of some very bad headset hair). Also, while I appreciated the EQ button that cycles between sound profiles, the sound quality on the whole isn’t as balanced and punchy as the Cloud II Wireless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfpjga"&gt;But speaking on its features alone, it’s a more affordable runner-up choice if you want better console compatibility (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.astrogaming.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Fcable-adapters%2Fa20-gen-2-usb-transmitter.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even though it comes at a $20 cost&lt;/a&gt; to have both Xbox and PlayStation support), and a headset that has a physical game and chat mixing dial. I found the wireless range of the A20 Gen 2 and its included wireless receiver to be quite good. My studio apartment is about 40 feet long and 15 feet wide, the headset kept a solid connection throughout. I was even able to run some trash outside without a drop. Astro claims up to 15 meters of range.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C dongle that ships with the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless makes it an alluring choice for Switch gamers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VyHuQL"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="H0bxb3"&gt;The amount of wireless gaming headsets is blossoming, and I expect to make an update to this section on a regular basis — perhaps more regularly than the sections below. As such, there are plenty of other options that didn’t quite make the cut as the “best” but are still pretty good in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1RkbU"&gt;Logitech’s G733 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081415GCS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=b5590989a235e9347cd765002d60dd96&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$127&lt;/a&gt;) came very close to being the runner-up headset. It’s comfortable with breathable ear cups, it has good sound for the price, and the vertical strips of LEDs actually look sharp. It misses the mark by not allowing a wired listening mode and for not having a game-chat audio mix dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJyiFA"&gt;The G Pro X Lightspeed (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081PP4CB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=19e702d2b62186465b570dcca369fd9f&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$183&lt;/a&gt;), also from Logitech, nails the basics of having good build quality, USB-C charging, and punchy sound quality. It goes a step beyond the G733 with better noise isolation. However, its heavy build wore uncomfortably on my head after a few hours and I don’t think it offers enough features to justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ5uWQ"&gt;The Audeze Penrose (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Wireless-Playstation-Low-Latency-Bluetooth/dp/B08D9PBR9X?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=6e608f6933710a8443e333369413294a&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299&lt;/a&gt;) has incredible sound quality, along with a plethora of features, like Bluetooth support for connecting a phone and console simultaneously, USB-C for charging, and a 3.5mm port for wired listening. However, considering its high price, it’s not nearly comfortable enough for my head size — it is heavy and too tight — and I think it is likely to wear heavily on other heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgokdG"&gt;If you’re mostly into playing games on the Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis 1 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices out there when it comes to ease of use. It isn’t a super comfortable headset, as it lacks the company’s ski band-style headband that distributes weight gently on your head. But it ships with a USB-C wireless receiver that can plug directly into the Switch or Switch Lite. Connectivity is strong, and audio quality is quite good given the headset’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X64MTGL?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=cfbb36f4c557294387d3902c446fc9a1&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$76 price tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="j1QvYC"&gt;Best Xbox-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;Microsoft Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BF4Nbd"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset is surprisingly good for $100. It has all of the same features as our previous top pick, Razer’s Kaira Pro, but knocks $50 off the price and has a better design. Like the Surface Headphones, this headset features twistable dials on the outside of its earcups, and it simplifies making quick adjustments, like turning up the volume on the right side, or tweaking the game / chat audio mix on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpptY"&gt;This headset operates on the Xbox Wireless protocol, letting it connect effortlessly to a modern Xbox console with a push of its pairing button (it pairs just like a controller). It supports a concurrent Bluetooth connection, too, so you can be paired to your phone and console at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTAiuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: it’s tough to find the Xbox Wireless headset in stock currently. Best Buy is the first place you should look for restocks. If you have to get a headset now, the best alternative is the runner-up below, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LRV49W8?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=eaf86b6a935186a1ebd412c822bc4cc5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Kaira Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LIHpB2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv7vfB"&gt;Battery life is fine, but not spectacular at around 15 hours per charge. While I really like the Bluetooth feature, this headset lacks a multifunction button for controlling, say, phone calls or playing / pausing music or podcasts coming from your phone or tablet that might be connected. Razer’s Kaira Pro makes this easier. Another fault is that this model lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that might not be a big deal for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYmful"&gt;Microsoft’s headset doesn’t break new ground, it just does a lot right for a reasonable price. There are other options that offer noise cancellation and more hearty sound quality than this model. But if you don’t want to spend more than $100, most people should be very happy with what the Xbox Wireless headset offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A6JDyP"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Xbox Wireless headset sound like:

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66Orpz"&gt;Razer’s new Kaira Pro for Xbox consoles and PC is one of the company’s most impressive headsets yet. It narrowly loses the matchup to the HS75 XB listed below when it comes to sound quality, but it leaps ahead with more features. It includes the option to connect to devices via Bluetooth so you can listen to music, podcasts, or take calls while you game on Xbox or PC. The Kaira Pro also has other features I expect to have in a wireless gaming headset, like USB-C charging and a handy game and chat dial for a customized audio mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXqF7"&gt;A particularly cool feature here are the built-in microphones that kick in when you’re connected to a device over Bluetooth. While the Kaira Pro includes a detachable boom mic for use with gaming on your console, these additional microphones are useful for on-the-go voice calls when you don’t want to be seen using the bigger microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hIYdw1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568243" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtxXA"&gt;As I mentioned before, the Kaira Pro sounds great, but it’s not quite as robust when put up against the Corsair model below. If you’re a stickler for crisp sound quality and better positional audio, opt for the runner-up since they’re open-back and not closed like Razer’s headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEhXsi"&gt;Razer’s headset looks and fits mostly like your average set of over-ear headphones, which is ideal since you can easily use it in that fashion with its Bluetooth function. The Kaira Pro’s build quality is better than I expected, particularly when it comes to comfort. It places equal pressure on the top of your head and around your ears, feeling just tight enough to keep the sound in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnqkBI"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Razer Kaira Pro sounds like:

&lt;p id="qgNCwe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC if you have an adapter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="orJF4d"&gt;If you’re locked to team Xbox, or find yourself switching between PC (with Microsoft’s Xbox wireless adapter) and your console, Corsair’s HS75 XB Wireless is currently the headset that I recommend if you want superb audio quality. It’s a $150 model that surprised me with impressive sound and a styling that looks like a set of premium open-back headphones. In addition to a bombastic sound that, at least for a moment, made me forget that I wasn’t using my Sony WH-1000XM3 wireless headphones, it’s comfortable to wear for hours. These look far heavier in images than they feel on my head, and I was delighted that they didn’t give off much of a pinching sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGpDXo"&gt;It’s usually the small details that win me over in a headset, and in the HS75 XB, it’s the symmetrical button layout. Thus, the learning curve for mastering the buttons is low, and this model has everything I need in a pinch, including a game and chat audio dial, volume dial, and an easy way to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7H0E2q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568253" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obhus1"&gt;Corsair’s 20-hour battery life claims for the HS75 XB are a tad lower than competing models. But its USB-C charging at least makes recharging faster and more simple to do than plugging in via Micro USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiN4Uu"&gt;I mentioned this with the Razer Kaira Pro, but wireless range is an issue here. Your living arrangement might yield different results, but breaking line of sight with the Xbox Wireless Adapter plugged into my PC or straying more than 15 or so feet away made the audio begin to crackle. I think I’d prefer if Corsair simply made its own dongle that was compatible with Xbox than going this route. Still, this is a great headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ix1BVV"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BO7lTo"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ySUxNR"&gt;The options above deliver the best experience for the money, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other solid options out there. We tested other wireless gaming headsets, though, there was usually one or more deal-breakers about each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9V3HE"&gt;The LucidSound LS15X (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MMSW147/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=83aa2896b7a6f9de3c8cac25250149e1&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$85&lt;/a&gt;), Nacon RIG 700 PRO HX (&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fpc-gaming%2Faccessories%2Fheadsets-and-mics%2Fproducts%2Frig-700-pro-hx-wireless-headset-with-dolby-atmos-for-xbox-series-x%2F11111809.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119&lt;/a&gt;), and the SteelSeries Arctis 7X Wireless (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7x&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) are good in some ways, but not good enough that I suggest you seek them out over the others above. All three offer satisfying comfort and passable sound quality, but they’re relatively light on extra features and they each charge via Micro USB, which is just inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NvDGre"&gt;Best PlayStation-specific wireless gaming headset: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731191871792355944" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony Pulse 3D&lt;/a&gt; ($100)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nz0scw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with PS5, PS4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sony Pulse 3D headset" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOf5ce2ocE5G4xWmRzB8Os1tqq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22276836/pulse3d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Sony Pulse 3D gaming headset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KWlvfW"&gt;Sony’s $99 Pulse 3D wireless headset for the PS4 and PS5 is a surprisingly feature-packed headset that’s also one of the most comfortable options on this list. I’m a sucker for well-fitting headsets, and the bungie-style headband Sony supplies is fantastic. Instead of having a hard plastic band pulling down on the top of your head, this headset hangs its weight on a silicone band. It gives the headset a near-weightless feel when it’s on my head. Just a note: the ear cups are on the smaller side, and while mine fit just fine, folks with larger ears might not find them all that comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avxDnB"&gt;The Pulse 3D’s headline feature, though, is its ability to serve up 3D audio from the PS5’s Tempest sound engine. Actually, Sony says most headphones can push out the 3D effect, but this headset was made to really show it off. Support for 3D audio varies from game to game, but I found the PS5’s &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; to be a great showcase for it. In that game, everything from the highs that ring out from swords clashing to daunting fire-breathing dragons that push out medium- and low-frequency sounds were a delight to hear. For a more relaxing experience, &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt; sound great, too. There are little sounds coming from everywhere, it seems. Games that don’t support 3D audio still sound good but are not quite as enthralling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPcK8B"&gt;For a $99 headset, the positional audio quality is better than I expected, as is the sound balance. There’s not an overwhelming amount of bass or tinny highs — everything is delivered delicately. I like that because it helps prevent fatigue during long play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63qvPj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbTnpB"&gt;Almost everything else about this headset is impressive for the price as well. The controls are a little more intuitively laid-out than Sony’s previous model for the PS4. The Pulse 3D features a tactile rocker that lets you balance game audio with your chat, and there are separate buttons just for adjusting volume. I like that there’s a dedicated switch for turning on mic monitoring, which helps to funnel in just a little bit of outside sound (including your own voice) through its built-in pinhole microphones, so you’re not totally isolated while wearing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiOAWK"&gt;Speaking of mic quality, these kinds of mics are certainly not as good as what you’d get with most boom microphones. For instance, some “s” and “f” sounds are often muddled. But on the whole, it’s serviceable. We’ll be on the lookout for PlayStation-specific headsets that offer up good mic quality — many console-exclusive headsets have been released for Xbox so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHWw0L"&gt;The Pulse 3D supports listening via an included 3.5mm cable or wirelessly when paired up to the 2.4GHz receiver. What’s new here is support for USB-C charging. Sony is by no means the only company putting USB-C in headsets these days, but it’s nevertheless nice to use the same cord that charges your DualSense to recharge this headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb182h"&gt;Sony claims 13 hours of wireless performance per charge. The headset actually landed between about 10 and 12 hours during my testing, which is an underwhelming result. Of course, this is less of an issue if you’re connecting it to a power source each time you stop gaming for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="srEr31"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Sony Pulse 3D sounds like:

&lt;p id="MPJACg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uWo9Sy"&gt;Bose’s QC 35 II gaming headset offers the most features, but at the highest cost of any other headset featured in this guide. Despite costing more than an Xbox Series S or Nintendo Switch, this set delivers on value. It comes with the QC 35 II wireless noise-canceling headphones that can be used on the go with Bluetooth and wired 3.5mm connectivity. There are no other options I’ve listed that have a noise cancellation feature and support for voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also among the most comfortable, lightweight options on this list. You’ll know when the QC 35 II is on your head, but it doesn’t pinch or press hard against your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRyE2r"&gt;Used as a gaming headset, either connected via USB through its included desktop controller or via 3.5mm, the QC 35 II makes for a lightweight, comfortable option with a microphone attachment that’s easy to use. This model offers the best noise isolation (even without the battery-draining noise cancellation feature switched on) in any headset I’ve tested. Noise isolation is usually something most headsets fumble, but with this one you’ll be able to better hear footsteps and other crucial noises that might decide the match. With noise cancellation switched on, it really does make everything around you very quiet — perfect for boosting the immersion in your games. The desktop controller I mentioned above adds more features, including a nice volume dial and button that adjusts the intensity of mic monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZtgrRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568255" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3ZNt7"&gt;The $329 price is high, but if you value noise cancellation and want to have a headset you can easily take on the road (and that has ear cups that can swivel and fold into a compact size), check this out. It’s worth noting that current owners of the QC 35 II headphones unfortunately won’t be able to easily acquire the microphone attachment, as Bose isn’t selling it separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b6Zsn5"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the Bose QC 35 II gaming headset sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oHaXwr"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YUH1Gy"&gt;The runner-up: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 + sound card&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="U8pXiM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compatible with any device with an available 3.5mm jack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer BlackShark V2" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xx8tXQweQhnns7y4ri_KSFBcyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20782512/blacksharkv2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ejvb7t"&gt;Razer’s updated BlackShark headset is my runner-up choice for a wired headset you can buy. It’s $100, yet it features a similar design and general feature set to Razer’s $200 wireless V2 Pro model. That also means it’s just as comfortable, with a plush headband and breathable ear cups that don’t apply too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOPElj"&gt;This model’s build materials are a step above the $59 BlackShark V2 X when it comes to being breathable, and it includes a USB sound card, into which the headset’s 3.5mm end plugs. With it, you’ll get slightly better sound quality. Also, using the sound card allows you to use THX spatial sound in Razer’s Synapse 3 software, which I found to be a nice value add but not particularly alluring in practice. Razer says it’s adding spatial audio profiles for popular games moving forward, so you’ll have plenty of ways to utilize the sound card, if this feature strikes your interest. Regardless of your interest, you’ll also be able to plug the headset’s 3.5mm end into a variety of controllers and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gz2EXW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9568257" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgFwUw"&gt;Something that stood out to me during testing is that finding a comfortable fit took almost no effort. And while many headsets are comfortable enough to wear for hours, I didn’t want to take the BlackShark V2 off my head. Another nice touch is its volume knob, which affords fine-tune adjustments that dials don’t usually provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SMekMu"&gt;Here’s what the microphone on the BlackShark V2 sounds like:

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TY1VFp"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ryiJOs"&gt;Other good options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bXkzte"&gt;If you’re committed to getting a wired headset, there are some interesting options out there — amid a lot of models you should skip outright. I got to test a few other headsets that, while not as good as the models above, might be a smarter buy for your needs or budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlIgFJ"&gt;For something less expensive than Bose’s headset that still sounds good and provides a lot of comfort, I suggest checking out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22445746/steelseries-prime-arctis-headset-wireless-plus-gaming-mouse-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SteelSeries’ Arctis Prime&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-prime&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21549510%2Fbest-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $100&lt;/a&gt;, like Razer’s BlackShark V2 above, and it offers a similar amount of features (which is to say, it’s light on them, featuring a volume wheel, a mute button, and a 3.5mm jack to share audio with a nearby teammate). While Razer’s model offers slightly deeper bass and depth, the Arctis Prime’s delivery is balanced and I don’t think you’ll feel fatigued by the sound after long-term use. That goes for the comfort, too. This headset has SteelSeries’ signature bungee-style headband that keeps the plastic frame off of your head, feeling very lightweight as a result. It also upgraded the ear pads to feel more deluxe and soft. I thought Razer’s model was just a bit more comfortable to wear over long periods of time, but it’s close enough that you should just buy whichever has a design that you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0go1F"&gt;HyperX’s Cloud Revolver 7.1 wired headset for a PC (&lt;a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedstates/us/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) might be worth checking out, particularly if you’re looking for something comfortable. This model is just as comfy to wear as the Cloud II Wireless, my top wireless pick at the top of this article. Sound quality isn’t at the same level, though, and I’d recommend holding off on any purchases until the price drops, as the package here is fairly light on features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Uaxxs"&gt;Creative Audio’s SXFI Air Gamer (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XML8MF6?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=1c1d6a3948296097ad1b8bcee82b7fa5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt;) is a USB-C / 3.5mm wired headset that offers a baffling amount of features for the price (including Bluetooth support for phones, touch controls, and even a microSD card slot for listening to stuff locally on-device). Like the previous model we checked out, the design is simplistic and the SXFI sound profile is fantastic to listen to for games, voice chat, or music. It’s disappointing that its sizing adjustments still don’t hold very well, and its button layout takes effort to learn and feels somewhat cobbled together. Those flaws might be worth overlooking for some people, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise starts pre-production of its autonomous shuttle thanks to $5 billion from GM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vb2kIUo94TXTV_EfbJ6GcfllTMo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455517/vpavic_200121_3874_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hIlkhm"&gt;Cruise is getting a $5 billion line of credit from General Motors’ financial division as it begins pre-production on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;Origin autonomous shuttle&lt;/a&gt;. It’s another big infusion of cash for Cruise, arguably one of the better capitalized autonomous vehicle companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHxmkk"&gt;Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the new financing “bumps up Cruise’s total war chest to over $10 billion as we enter commercialization.” This will help the company as its fully autonomous shuttles enter series production at the GM Detroit-Hamtramck Plant (rebranded as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;Factory Zero&lt;/a&gt;) sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuJTEs"&gt;Ammann writes in a &lt;a href="https://www.getcruise.com/news/hitting-the-accelerator"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, “$10 billion. It’s a big number.” “However, when you think about what we’re building — safer, cleaner, and more accessible transportation for the world — you quickly realize it’s also a necessary number.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CrCEyr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“$10 billion. It’s a big number.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwV1TR"&gt;It’s a lot of money to spend on a vehicle powered by an autonomous driving technology that still is in the testing phase. Cruise hasn’t launched its ride-hail service yet, nor has it revealed an actual working version of the Origin. The company has a beta ride-hailing service, but it’s only available to employees, and Cruise won’t say when it will be available to the broader public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvCMVd"&gt;Cruise had planned to roll out a commercial service in San Francisco in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;but ultimately postponed those plans&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to announce a new date. Cruise is under pressure from its investors, namely SoftBank, to launch a commercial robotaxi service. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;recently received a permit&lt;/a&gt; from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test fully driverless cars without human safety drivers in San Francisco. And it announced plans to begin testing its Origin vehicles in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22376258/cruise-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-dubai-2023"&gt;Dubai starting in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MP0SpZ"&gt;Ammann says that over the last few weeks he has overseen the building of “nearly a hundred pre-production Origins” at GM’s Pre-Production Operations center. “These will undergo an intensive testing and validation process this summer,” he writes. “Seeing them up close and in person is absolutely thrilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bizI7"&gt;It’s unclear whether the legal landscape regulating automobile safety will change in time for Cruise to release the Origin shuttle, which lacks traditional human controls. Cruise will need &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21125358/nuro-self-driving-delivery-robot-r2-fmvss-exemption"&gt;an exemption from the federal government’s motor vehicle safety standards&lt;/a&gt;, which require vehicles to have a steering wheel and pedals. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) only grants 2,500 such exemptions a year. (There is legislation to increase that number to 25,000, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133389/house-energy-commerce-self-driving-car-hearing-bill-2020"&gt;but it is currently stalled in the Senate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P12Lbh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFWY7e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another podcast goes exclusive to Spotify: Call Her Daddy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaqKnTYYfWCduNPk8RUoAnHT7oU=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455459/CHDCoverArt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZKGmbf"&gt;Spotify continues its run on signing podcasts to exclusive deals, and this time, it’s locked down&lt;em&gt; Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;, the popular show that covers topics like sex, dating, and mental health. The show will go exclusive on July 21st, meaning the entire back catalog and future episodes will only be available on Spotify. The details of the deal weren’t shared, but &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-nearing-deal-to-exclusively-license-call-her-daddy-podcast-11623441017"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that the licensing deal could be for as much as $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxbZTQ"&gt;Spotify’s goal with this deal is clear: it says the show was the fifth most popular on the platform last year, with multiple other Spotify-signed podcasters at the top of that list, as well, including Joe Rogan and Michelle Obama. This is the second big deal Spotify has inked this year. Last month, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Dax Shepard’s &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt; as an exclusive, starting July 1st. It’s also producing and distributing shows for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294863/kim-kardashian-west-spotify-exclusive-podcast-innocence-project-deal-announced"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176014/prince-harry-meghan-markle-podcast-spotify-exclusive-archewell-audio"&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the networks it’s purchased in its quest for podcast domination, like The Ringer, Gimlet Media, and Parcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4d9Xk"&gt;Now that the company’s signed deals with many of the world’s biggest podcasters, the question isn’t so much who’s next as how will this strategy pan out? Can signing big names really grow its podcasting audience and bring more people to the app? Will people spend less time streaming music? That’s a story Spotify will have to tell in its earnings reports in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zs5eSG006hIp6CIU2Eg0nsrU2g=/137x0:763x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/Twitter-block.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of our information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools that are available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a couple of minutes to find them and turn them off. For that, you need to go to the “Personalization and data” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NnD0vh"&gt;Using the mobile Twitter app:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8bEs6h"&gt;Tap on the three lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C8PHhb"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Personalization and data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="luURSL"&gt;Using the web version of Twitter:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="A7EEJw"&gt;Sign in to your Twitter account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DHaXI3"&gt;Use this link to go to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to you data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9B8NHe-TFyqKU7IKZloxCsLgC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659849/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.46.58_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SsF0qC"&gt;The rest of this article will assume you’re using the web version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas — a listing of other accounts that have access to your account and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account that shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what is meant when Twitter asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chvCaLd-B1A4RPA3CxGzHkbCFVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659852/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_10.00.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WcYWPm"&gt;Want to be really safe? You may want to just bite the bullet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete your Twitter history &lt;/a&gt;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqgdcx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
