    <title>Samsung’s Q3 revenue hits a new record high </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VdKi5A"&gt;In 2020, Samsung weathered the pandemic by&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21539702/samsung-q3-earnings-record-revenue-phone-sales"&gt; posting a record high for revenue in the third quarter of 66.96 trillion won&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-3q-2021-results?utm_source=nr_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;just revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it set another record for the same period in 2021, reaching 73.98 trillion won, or about $63 billion. While its revenue was up about 10 percent, Samsung says its profits grew by 26 percent from last year to hit 15.82 trillion won ($13 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sfTHO"&gt;Despite a shortage of key chips worldwide, the memory chips and processors Samsung makes that go into everything from servers to mobile phones are in as much demand as ever. Shifts to hybrid work mean have companies buying more SSDs, CPUs, and RAM for servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0v4PQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will “reorganize” to focus on quantum dot  4K TVs instead of LCDs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mC4z7d"&gt;As the world’s largest chipmaker, high prices for memory chips mean high profits for Samsung, even if rising costs for raw materials and logistics cut into the profits of its consumer electronics division. Sales for its memory division specifically were up 46 compared to the same period last year, while profits for the semiconductor division as a whole nearly doubled, going from 5.54 trillion won to 10.06 trillion won (~$8.5 billion) (&lt;a href="https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/global/ir/docs/2021_3Q_conference_eng.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5APSg"&gt;Samsung is also the world’s largest phone maker and says that it saw strong demand for foldable like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the low- to mid-range Galaxy smartphones it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRWhAJ"&gt;Despite reports of possible production issues and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;slashed manufacturing targets&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup, Samsung says its mobile display earnings rose “driven by demand for newly launched products from major smartphone customers.” The most major customer that Samsung provides its mobile OLED displays to is Apple, and that company will report its quarterly earnings tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtJlcR"&gt;Looking into the future, Samsung expects solid earnings for its mobile displays in Q4, and not just because of phones. There’s demand for OLED in larger devices like laptops, tablets, and especially game consoles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Nintendo’s new Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a Samsung-made panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Nd1N"&gt;As far as its TV business, the company is focused on the high-end, saying that it is on track to start producing new quantum dot-based sets that will continue Samsung’s fight against OLED TVs from LG.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s new Aurora R13 comes with Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware R13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JldSxs0mUjsN3pSktk-oAhS9uDA=/0x575:3900x3175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054246/alien_ware_aurora_r13.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1LEDHy"&gt;Alienware’s new Aurora R13 gaming desktop comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;Intel’s newly released 12th Gen Alder Lake chip&lt;/a&gt; and a brand-new design. You can choose anything from the Core i5-12600KF up to an i9-1200KF, as well as a range of Nvidia graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware R13 Legend 2.0 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6Ujik1JVq7D4oqjsbbAPvXnKQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960599/alienware_aurora_r13_legend_case.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8pwJjZ"&gt;The R13 also shows off Alienware’s redesigned Legend 2.0 chassis, which comes with an increased amount of internal space that’s supposed to promote better airflow. It also offers the option of a clear side panel that tacks on an extra $70 to your purchase. You can still open the case without any tools, making it easy to upgrade components or start customizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3qzPM"&gt;On the AMD side of things, Alienware introduced the Aurora Ryzen Edition R14 that ships with up to an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X chip — but the processor isn’t the only thing that’s different about this machine. While the R13 comes in white (“lunar light”) and black (“dark side of the Moon”), you can only purchase the R14 in black. Despite the color difference, the R14 will still sport the Legend 2.0 case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware R13 open case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r07_smgKor4ivdcnUv8StNxhdJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960631/r13_open_case.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GCnaHG"&gt;Having the 12th Gen Alder Lake chip gives the R13 access to more hardware options when compared to the R14. For example, while the R13 can support up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM, the R14 only supports up to 128GB of DDR4 RAM. The R13 also gives you the option of installing the Alienware Cryo-Tech Special Edition CPU liquid cooler, which has a 120mm radiator with a pump speed of 2800RPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipRJlw"&gt;The highest-rated power supply options are 750W Platinum for both builds. Storage is also the same on the R13 and R14 — you can choose up to a 2TB NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD and 2TB SATA HDD. Both the R13 and R14 ship with Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware R13 side view" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C03pmq0pMiAGCnwTnntpOMoOYzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960697/alienware_r13_side.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YxYGgk"&gt;The Aurora R13 is available on Alienware’s site right now, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r13-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r13-desktop/wdr13aur30h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with pricing starting at $1,479.99&lt;/a&gt;.  Meanwhile, the R14 is slightly cheaper, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-ryzen-edition-r14-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r14-desktop/wdr14aur30h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a starting price of $1,249.99&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re not into the flashy look of these two PCs, Dell has also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/blog/beauty-meets-brawn-unleashing-the-new-xps-desktop/"&gt;its first XPS Desktop that comes with a liquid cooling option&lt;/a&gt;. Like the R13, it also comes with the 12th Gen Intel Core processor but has a much more low-key look. The XPS will become available sometime this fall, starting at $919.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOEh50"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503001/nvidia-rtx-3080-and-3090-supply-issues-2021"&gt;RTX 3080 and 3090 graphics cards are in short supply&lt;/a&gt;, it might be tempting to purchase a prebuilt Alienware PC just to get your hands on one — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;especially since the shortage shows no sign of stopping&lt;/a&gt;. Both the R13 and R14 builds give you the option to choose from an Nvidia RTX 3080, 3080 Ti, and 3090. Price will vary depending on the one you choose, of course, but it will still probably be cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;if you decided to buy one from a scalper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay to share your FaceTime screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVae-cS6Azvyc1ojvyhJoeTGAOg=/151x0:1708x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054096/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_3.39.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rVwYI"&gt;One of the new features that iOS 15 has promised to offer is the ability to share your iPhone and iPad screen during FaceTime sessions so that you can enjoy films, music, and other media along with friends and family. While this new feature, called SharePlay, did not ship with the first version of iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;it has been included in iOS 15.1&lt;/a&gt; and can now be enjoyed — to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoTigL"&gt;Currently, you can share content from Apple TV and Apple Music — assuming both of you are subscribers — and a few other apps. I had no problem sharing a YouTube video, for example; other apps that are supported include HBO Max, Hulu, and Disney Plus (but not Netflix). It can be presumed that the list of shareable apps will continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B82Gs8"&gt;It’s quite easy to use the new SharePlay feature, once you’ve installed iOS 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6YTBHh"&gt;Start a FaceTime session. Make sure whoever else is on the session also has iOS 15.1 installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gnLi6x"&gt;You should see a new icon on the upper right side of the screen that resembles a small figure in front of a screen. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ApbjOw"&gt;You’ll see a drop-down button that says “Share My Screen.” Tap on that and you’ll be sharing your screen with your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVCThijIWn6KU7YrpNwga9zSr58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960467/IMG_DD5C33FA0874_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Njh9Kxf8AiYyMVmvf0mlfAzZptA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960468/IMG_60BC16B3DB0E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gOH64r"&gt;Now you can show off your homescreen to your FaceTime friend, play a YouTube video, or listen to the same Apple Music track. If you want to switch to the other person’s screen, all they have to do is tap on their SharePlay icon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkI9Sr"&gt;Another way to share an app is to simply go to that app during a FaceTime session and start it up. If SharePlay is possible, you will get a pop-up menu asking if you want to use SharePlay, or if you want to play the video or music only for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ox15m"&gt;And at any time, you can go back to your FaceTime app, tap on the SharePlay icon, and select End SharePlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can see your friend’s home screen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIJXzKVleBy8TbXilrjRe4y9D28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960470/IMG_B56CC427212E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see your friend’s homescreen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmKZe1FqMkh6pCpIlWooRMI5wDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960475/IMG_B3896698408C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHryBS"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in iOS 15.1 is probably going to be very popular. It will allow friends and family to chat together while watching videos or listening to music; let business associates discuss a spreadsheet while out and about; or make it easier to share and comment on your latest group photos. And as Apple adds more apps that can make use of SharePlay, it should just get better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s system to tell on creepy apps just arrived in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTD-U2p-SrpiBi62HoKVK65tcPk=/223x0:2416x1462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054031/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.46.16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1L2lT"&gt;Apple’s App Privacy Report, announced at WWDC 2021, has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n5jlz7ox&amp;amp;1635379062"&gt;made its way onto iPhones&lt;/a&gt; with the first release of the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/everything-new-ios-15-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new screen in Settings gives users an overview of what information their apps have access to and what they’re sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1At2"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=3053"&gt;Apple’s WWDC announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the feature will show you what permissions apps have and how often they accessed them over the past week (for example, it could show that your weather app accesses your location every hour). The report will also show you which other web domains the app contacted and let you compare that with the sites you visited directly in the app to give you a better idea of who could be seeing your data. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajuZM4lbuJsxSChLwSIK-RBGslA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960619/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.32.28.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Safari Privacy Report, which shows similar data but for the websites you visit instead of the apps you use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXYzhT"&gt;Some of Apple’s other privacy initiatives haven’t sat well with all developers. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296309/google-gmail-ios-app-privacy-labels"&gt;took Google almost two months&lt;/a&gt; to adopt iOS App Store privacy labels, and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt; partially blamed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;iPhone’s Ad Tracking Transparency feature&lt;/a&gt; (which lets users easily opt out of certain forms of ad tracking) for missed revenue goals. It’s possible that we’ll see more complaints from developers if the App Privacy Report paints them in a negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYgl6K"&gt;As always with betas, it’s not a sure-fire thing that this feature will make it into the final 15.2 release. However, Apple’s SharePlay feature, which showed up in the 15.1 beta (after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;taken out from an earlier beta&lt;/a&gt; release), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;did end up shipping with the final version&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s a good chance we could see the privacy report soon. Whether we like what shows may be another story entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5JoGh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS8GMH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI8YYA"&gt;A Hollywood union representing tens of thousands of production workers will soon decide whether to ratify agreements that will, among other labor protections, enforce better pay from streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f13TRF"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) announced Tuesday that it reached a tentative three-year “area standards” agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) that “delivers our members a fairer deal on streaming,” according to the union’s international president Matthew Loeb. AMPTP represents major Hollywood studios that include, among others, Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnJaZ0"&gt;A spokesperson for the union told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that lawyers are still working out details of the agreement, which could “take a few days.” After that, members will need time to review the terms. A vote should then be scheduled in the next few weeks, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v6sjec"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you don't have the budget to prioritize safety, then you don't have the budget to make movies. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;— IATSE // #IASolidarity (@IATSE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IATSE/status/1453036345899814917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7V5shp"&gt;The tentative deal reached this week will cover some 20,000 workers on productions in TV and film — including crew, artists, editors, and other behind-the-scenes roles — from 23 local unions across the US. Earlier this month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22731087/hollywood-union-reaches-contract-agreement-iatse-avoids-strike"&gt;tentative deal&lt;/a&gt; was reached for separate “basic” and “videotape” contracts that cover another 40,000 workers represented by 13 West Coast-based local unions that are part of IATSE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dprLne"&gt;That earlier agreement narrowly avoided a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;major Hollywood strike&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported nearly unanimously by the union’s members and would have had an industry-wide impact. The union’s members supported the strike authorization after negotiations stalled with AMPTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcNGzb"&gt;The proposed “area standards” agreement will improve pay “significantly” by up to 60 percent for its lowest-paid workers, according to the union. All members who operate under the new contracts will see their pay increase by a minimum of 9 percent over the three-year term. The proposed agreement also covers rest periods, breaks, wage terms, and payouts from streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xBJPD"&gt;“We were able to achieve gains in all of our core areas,” Loeb said in a statement. “Quality of life issues were at the top of our priority list. The protective terms we negotiated in this agreement and the agreement reached earlier establish a defined weekend with the studios for the first time. The two agreements incorporate stiff penalties for failing to provide meals and breaks. Taken together, the improvements we made at the bargaining table are very significant and directly due to the solidarity of our members.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop memes even harder with ‘Web3 Gaming’ and NFT job listings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tAFH8vML4EbXDWP2-8R50MYkLb4=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70053091/20170822_Sean_Hollister_Verge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ezNrqI"&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;rollercoaster of a year on the stock market&lt;/a&gt; fueled by WallStreetBets retail trading, GameStop is going full meme and looking to build a “Web3” platform, according to a flurry of job listings posted to its careers site on Monday. One of those ads, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/gamestop-enters-the-metaverse-with-web3-gaming-job-post/"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2767078769/"&gt;LinkedIn listing&lt;/a&gt; for a “Head of Web3 Gaming” in which the company says it's looking for someone to “accelerate the future of gaming and commerce” based on blockchains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrLykR"&gt;If you’re lucky enough to have never heard the phrase “Web3,” it’s often used to describe a decentralized, crypto-based internet. That tracks with the other job listings, which indicate that GameStop is developing some sort of NFT platform, likely based on Ethereum. While sometimes job listings are just job listings, in this case, it may be a play by GameStop to get back on WallStreetBets’ radar or to work its way into the crypto community’s good graces. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ssuo3l0ZKXHkr6IdnftIVsznXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958377/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_17.56.08.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop’s many job listings for NFT and Web3 Gaming-related positions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbb9MG"&gt;GameStop hasn’t mentioned its ardent retail trading fans much &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2021%2F06%2F10%2Fgamestop-gme-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F27%2F22747748%2Fgamestop-web3-gaming-nft-job-listing-nfts-ethereum" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in its earnings calls&lt;/a&gt;, but the company’s stock has clearly benefited from their enthusiasm — at the beginning of 2021, it was hovering around $20 per share, and it closed on Tuesday at $177.84, according to Yahoo Finance. High stock prices don’t necessarily indicate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2021%2F09%2F11%2Fgamestop-earnings-another-stinker%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F27%2F22747748%2Fgamestop-web3-gaming-nft-job-listing-nfts-ethereum" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that the company as a whole is doing well&lt;/a&gt;, but they can at least help keep people liking the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTW4T7"&gt;When you’re dealing with an Internet mob, though, attention eventually fades. AMC has tried to court back traders’ interest (it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;caught up in the same trading fiasco&lt;/a&gt; as GameStop) with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465198/amc-meme-stock-popcorn-wsb"&gt;things like free popcorn&lt;/a&gt; and news that they’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;looking into accepting Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; and other crypto at theaters. For GameStop, it’s possible that an NFT platform promising a future of games where “play is driven by the things you bring” and incorporating buzzy phrases like “Web3” and “blockchain-based gaming” is a similar tactic to reignite the passion investors once felt for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bkc7lM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re trying to get Reddit traders’ attention, building an NFT platform could be a pro strat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tR5zEE"&gt;With all the talk about GameStop as a wild stock market bet, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that its main business is &lt;em&gt;being a video game store. &lt;/em&gt;Whether or not video game vendors allow for games that include NFTs is a bit of an open question at this point — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;Valve declared&lt;/a&gt; that developers can’t sell blockchain-enabled games on its Steam store, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729050/epic-game-store-open-to-blockchain-cryptocurrency-nft-games"&gt;Epic has said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s okay with them. Apple has yet to publicly make a decision about the App Store, possibly because developers are rightfully scared to be the first ones to try submitting an NFT-powered app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTtceC"&gt;Meanwhile, GameStop seems very interested in becoming a place for those kinds of projects — one of the listed responsibilities in the job description is “build a team to help creators launch their projects on the GameStop platform.” While the company seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/05/26/gamestop-is-hiring-for-new-nft-platform-on-ethereum/"&gt;teased plans for something NFT-related&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, an obscure webpage is more cryptic than a call for applicants who want to build a blockchain empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zaYFqn"&gt;To whoever’s going to try and do this for GameStop, I wish you luck — because you’re going to need it. Dropping the ball on this project could upset the crypto people, retail traders, and blockchain game developers, and that’s a Venn diagram I’d want to be well outside of. Though if things do end up going disastrously wrong, please email me because that could be an incredible story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Onewheel GT can travel 32 miles on a single charge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_JCLHv3lBveX1cTfVL0GH-PmFzY=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70053023/Shot_2_Dust.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Future Motion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pm3t3M"&gt;California startup Future Motion has revealed two new versions of its funky self-balancing electric rideable it calls Onewheel, with more range, power, and better ergonomics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OT5BSM"&gt;The most capable of the two is the new $2,200 Onewheel GT, which Future Motion says was “completely redesigned from the ground up.” It employs a higher-voltage control system that pushes more power to the motor — Future Motion says the GT is the “first 3 horsepower Onewheel.” The GT is pulling that power from a battery pack made up of 21700 lithium-ion batteries (the same size cell that powers many of Tesla’s current vehicles), which give it a whopping 32 miles of range on a full charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oV98me"&gt;Performance aside, Future Motion says the Onewheel GT now has concave footpads for better board feel, brighter headlights, a sturdier carrying handle, and an optional treaded tire for people who want to take their Onewheel off-road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9Hv7UE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10830862"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="niz8tx"&gt;The other new vehicle announced Wednesday is an update to the smaller Onewheel that Future Motion announced in 2019, the Pint. The new $1,400 Pint X gets more than twice the original Pint’s range (18 miles compared to six to eight miles previously) and a slight boost to top speed (18 miles per hour compared to 16mph previously). It also gets some small fit and finish upgrades, adjustable riding modes via the companion smartphone app, and will even be available in a neon colorway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExnJ3r"&gt;Electric bikes, scooters, and skateboards have become increasingly popular over the last decade, and the pandemic has only increased the focus on alternative modes of transportation. Onewheel has been able to survive by carving out an extremely specific niche and making really good products, even while companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22575594/boosted-electric-skateboard-khosla-lime-lawsuit"&gt;Boosted&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943500/inboard-technology-electric-skateboard-scooters-layoffs-sale-liquidation"&gt;Inboard&lt;/a&gt; (which ostensibly sold more “approachable” electric skateboards) went out of business. That focus appears evident in the new models, which are significant refinements — but still not reinventions — of the Onewheel we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/11/5296628/the-dream-of-the-perfect-electric-skateboard-continues-at-ces-with"&gt;first met seven years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCL’s new wireless soundbar gives Roku TVs better audio for $179.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wall mounted TV with Soundbar on a blue entertainment center in a clean apartment with a laundry hamper to the right" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b83Eghw0xLHsaoy89hTWYPbf43Q=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052916/smallblog_R1_Lifestyle_Front_V1_5000x3333.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One less cable to run makes this look more achievable | Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EoHdx8"&gt;If you need to elevate the audio experience for your second guest bedroom’s Roku TV, TCL’s new soundbar may be the one for you. The &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/products/audio/tcl-roku-tv-wireless-soundbar" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku TV Wireless Soundbar&lt;/a&gt; (announced at CES 2021 as the Alto R1) is TCL’s vision of a simple and easy audio drop-in solution for $179.99 that only works with Roku TVs but not any other Roku streaming box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkJwEa"&gt;As far as soundbars go, the unit is bare bones with no HDMI or audio ports. TCL is saying this is by design for a clutter-free entertainment center where the only cable you need to route is the power cable — all other functions are wireless using Wi-Fi 802.11ac. A part of the “Roku TV Ready” lineup of products the company is putting out, this soundbar uses the existing Roku TV remote and lets you pair the soundbar wirelessly through the Roku TV setup menus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Rear of the TCL Roku TV wireless soundbar with one power port, a reset button, and no other ports" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OPJlpUPOicvQ2ehaiOp04yjL0vY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959729/http___image.roku.com_w_rapid_images_pdp_carousel_items_99cb46b6_0a47_40c0_a8de_5d36920d9486.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;No ports means less cables, but also less options.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ehYngq"&gt;In terms of features, the Roku TV Wireless Soundbar is 2.0 channel pumping out what the company calls “studio quality” audio with a max output of 120W. Multiple EQ settings are available in the TV sound settings menu, and the soundbar is capable of software updates. Expandability includes adding the Roku Wireless Subwoofer for 2.1 audio, but unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18116610/roku-tv-wireless-speakers-review"&gt;Roku’s own&lt;/a&gt; wireless speakers can’t come to play. The soundbar also has Bluetooth 5.0 to stream from smartphones and includes wall mount hardware for some DIY frills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctOj8P"&gt;TCL does sell other “Roku TV Ready” soundbars with subwoofers and HDMI, such as the Alto 6+ for $129.99, and those can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113141/roku-surround-sound-smart-soundbar-wireless-speakers-home-theater"&gt;use the wireless speaker set for full surround sound&lt;/a&gt;. If you can figure out how to plug in one HDMI cable, then this probably isn’t made for you. But if your TV setup is unusually complicated, or you just want to meet the bare minimum requirements for upgraded audio without taking extra steps, this is a budget-friendly match for your Roku TV set. Available now for $179.99 from &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-alto-r1-roku-tv-wireless-2-0-channel-sound-bar-for-roku-tvs-bluetooth-tsr1-31-5-inch-black-black%2F6475655.p%3FskuId%3D6475655&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Wireless-Channel-Sound-Bluetooth/dp/B099Z7K3N7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU opens formal investigation into Nvidia’s Arm acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8-B5Yc59BH0zckla_kFp_XSFdok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052855/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6v6NPI"&gt;The European Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/setback-nvidias-54-bln-arm-bid-eu-regulators-open-probe-2021-10-27/"&gt;opened a formal competition investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Nvidia’s acquisition of chip designer Arm. The deal, which would see Nvidia purchase the UK-based company from SoftBank for $40 billion, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;announced in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yD8SP6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_5624"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, the EU’s Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said that Nvidia buying Arm could make it harder for other manufacturers to access Arm’s technology, hurting much of the semiconductor industry (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;already facing supply problems&lt;/a&gt;). At the heart of concerns is Arm’s neutrality. Arm licenses its chip designs to a broad range of companies including Apple, Samsung, and Qualcomm, many of which compete with one another and Nvidia. There are fears that having Nvidia control Arm may result in Nvidia’s competitors being put at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fZnXmt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Regulators aren’t taking Nvidia’s word that it’ll keep Arm open&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yqucrq"&gt;Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says this won’t happen and has committed to maintaining Arm’s open licensing model. But critics of the deal fear that regulators won’t be able to force Nvidia to remain neutral indefinitely, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in February. According to the EU’s press release, Nvidia submitted commitments to try to address some of these concerns, but the commission decided they were “insufficient to clearly dismiss its serious doubts as to the effect of the transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMMZOW"&gt;The EU also plans on investigating how the deal could affect how competitors share information with Arm, and whether Nvidia could change Arm’s research and development funding to make its products more profitable, to the detriment of those that use Arm’s other tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAm9rH"&gt;Both Nvidia and Arm have been expecting regulatory investigations like this and anticipate that the deal could take 18 months to complete. The EU’s investigation is unlikely to be the only regulatory scrutiny the deal faces either. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634379/nvidia-arm-aquisition-delay-uk-phase-2-investigation"&gt;recommended its own in-depth investigation&lt;/a&gt; in August, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidias-acquisition-of-arm-to-face-u-k-antitrust-probe-11609959700#:~:text=LONDON%E2%80%94U.K.%20officials%20said%20they,Arm%20from%20SoftBank%20Group%20Corp.&amp;amp;text=That%20philosophy%20led%20to%20its,95%25%20of%20the%20world%27s%20smartphones."&gt;after asking third parties to comment on the merger&lt;/a&gt;. According to the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, regulators in the US and China could also take a formal look at the deal. Separately, the UK is also investigating its potential national security implications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google makes it easier for Android developers to build apps with its Material You design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12 running on Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7Absq0oih71wNwMdc5Bxqivsho=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052735/pixelandroid12.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iFzKyy"&gt;Android 12 has launched along with Google’s new Pixel 6 lineup and brings with it a new look that Android VP of product management Sameer Samat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;called “the biggest design change in Android’s history.”&lt;/a&gt; That’s in reference to Material You, which applies a new set of principles for creating interfaces, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;changes that will help Android adjust to bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve already gotten a hint of how the look affects usability across the updated OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666355/google-material-you-design-gmail-calendar-docs-android"&gt;and Google’s own apps&lt;/a&gt;, but now the focus is expanding to reach more of the apps made by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXympB"&gt;Today at Google’s Android Developer Summit, the company announced that &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/12L-preview-large-screens.html"&gt;Material You is available&lt;/a&gt; in Jetpack Compose, so app designers can more easily adopt the look in their own products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Material You design in Android 12&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr89Ub"&gt;New elements include dynamic guidelines that will help apps respond and adjust algorithmically to a user’s wallpaper choice, as well as tips on how to maintain a third-party app’s individual brand expression while adapting. Another element developers will need to learn about are the design tokens that “represent design system styles as data” so they can change as the system changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TCqfRS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="8prLCV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.5%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9-BJh8Os6W6iQIp1gtOh2T" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOwimm"&gt;Developers can see how their apps will look in different circumstances using the Material Theme Builder, which is available as a Figma plugin and on the web starting today. Beyond just how apps look, Google says that new features for its Jetpack libraries will help developers manage Android 12’s background restrictions, measure performance, and handle backward compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAawJJ"&gt;For future updates, Google says it’s planning on accessibility updates that tie into the dynamic color and adaptive layouts. Other guidance and system adjustments will help apps work with new form factors like foldables, even though Google doesn’t make a foldable phone... yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything we know so far ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22735454/google-foldable-phone-pixel-fold-pixel-6-samsung"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
