    <title>Tesla to accept bitcoin as payment in ‘near future’ after $1.5 billion investment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ABKg0Ca-QLODxrocA3J0CRQ_cvQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785942/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zs8Igo"&gt;Tesla says it has invested $1.5 billion in the bitcoin cryptocurrency. The electric car manufacturer filed its annual &lt;a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-004599/"&gt;10-K report&lt;/a&gt; with the SEC this morning, and revealed the new bitcoin investment. Tesla says it will also “begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qciZqN"&gt;Tesla customers have been calling on founder and CEO Elon Musk to accept bitcoin for vehicle purchases recently. Musk has been vocal about backing the cryptocurrency on Twitter, even adding #bitcoin to his profile recently. Musk has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets"&gt;backing Dogecoin on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; over the past week, sending its value up just moments after his tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="AADNkP"&gt;In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saCo1b"&gt;Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bitcoin price on Monday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxz7dF"&gt;News of the Tesla investment has sent the price of bitcoin up to &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin"&gt;more than $43,000 &lt;/a&gt;this morning, breaking its all-time high. The price of the cryptocurrency has been gradually increasing throughout 2021, as demand from both institutional and retail buyers has increased. It still remains a volatile cryptocurrency, though, with the price dipping below $30,000 in January alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSB1SA"&gt;The bitcoin investment also follows news of Tesla’s updated Model S. Tesla just announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;first major redesign of the Model S&lt;/a&gt; since it launched the electric sedan in 2012. The updated car will be available in March, and includes a refreshed design, new interior, and a 520-mile range option. Tesla’s Model X is also getting some improvements on the outside and a new interior update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s global Mi 11 has a Snapdragon 888 for €749</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FP2bb3mf9m7tLypz32Ao6UV1i1s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785861/DSCF7497.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AD8JE"&gt;Xiaomi is announcing the international version of its Mi 11 flagship phone today after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;earlier release in China&lt;/a&gt;. No &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267807/xiaomi-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-phone-announced"&gt;wild waterfall displays&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;sci-fi wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; here — this device is very much in keeping with the Mi series’ MO of offering high specs at a competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewFpet"&gt;The Mi 11 has a Snapdragon 888 processor, making it the first phone to launch with Qualcomm’s latest high-end chip (though Samsung’s Galaxy S21 series beat it to market outside China). The 888 has 5G connectivity built in, of course, and the phone has 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui8BMO"&gt;The screen appears to be the same panel — or very similar — to what’s found in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. It’s a slightly curved 6.8-inch 1440p OLED with a refresh rate of 120Hz and peak brightness of 1,500 nits, matching Samsung’s phone spec-for-spec. I don’t have the S21 Ultra to compare side-by-side, but I can tell you that the Mi 11’s screen is extremely good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/glOdoGDCdddN6sBSrVBINgfLPwk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288836/DSCF7498.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b9NQ2M"&gt;The Mi 11 has a 108-megapixel primary camera backed by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 5-megapixel “telemacro” camera. The selfie camera is 20 megapixels and tucked inside a small holepunch cutout at the top left of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgGWH0"&gt;The battery is 4,600mAh and can be charged at up to 55W with a cable and up to 50W wirelessly. The Mi 11 also features reverse wireless charging at up to 10W. It runs MIUI 12, based on Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3oZIn"&gt;Xiaomi hasn’t provided a full list of regions or launch dates just yet, but says the Mi 11 will be priced at €749 (~$900) for the 8GB/128GB model. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-mi-11-launched-europe/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+xda-developers%2FShsH+%28xda-developers%29#pricingmi11:~:text=The%20Xiaomi%20Mi%2011%20is%20priced%20at%20%E2%82%AC749%20for%20the%208GB%2B128GB%20variant%20and%20%E2%82%AC799%20for%20the%208GB%2B256GB%20variant.%20As"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the 8GB/256GB model will retail for €799 (~$960). Stay tuned for a full review. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpeedTest app now measures your network’s ability to stream video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/USZhODzdWLZhJmtn3Hah3-EcTRs=/70x38:949x624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785860/end_of_test_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The test shows the maximum resolution your internet connection can stream.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ookla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgPIVi"&gt;SpeedTest’s iOS app can now benchmark your internet’s video streaming quality, &lt;a href="http://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/video-test-announcement/"&gt;Ookla announced today&lt;/a&gt;. While the service typically checks general connection metrics like maximum download and upload speeds and latency, the new test is focused specifically on video. It attempts to stream at a variety of resolutions, and then measures load times and buffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmR9Tt"&gt;Ookla explains that it added the new test because of how much of our time spent on the internet involves streaming video. While its standard speed tests give a general idea of your overall network bandwidth, Ookla points out that internet service providers often “prioritize video traffic differently than other traffic.” This means the best way to benchmark video streaming performance is ultimately just to stream video samples, since it “cannot be simulated across a network.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6LgKKHsNOnqi5wJPXj4gNjKFDR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288845/test_running_3_uncropped.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ookla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The test works by literally streaming video, a process Ookla says can’t be simulated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yet5ne"&gt;The video streaming test is only available in the service’s iOS app for now, though Ookla says it’s coming to more platforms soon. During the test, the app streams a video at a variety of resolutions, before listing details like your internet connection’s maximum resolution, and video streaming load time. If you’re still unable to stream video despite your internet speeds being fast enough to support it, then Ookla says the app will link to DownDetector to check if a service is experiencing issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hQXvE"&gt;SpeedTest’s video streaming benchmark is available with the service’s latest iOS update, alongside a slightly redesigned interface.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 Pro could feature Hasselblad-branded cameras  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsINoC9CbBm3zNf2FUSeTF4R3BM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785766/Etj1c86XYAAlZz8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"&gt;Dave2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sY0ow9"&gt;Leaked images of the unannounced OnePlus 9 Pro suggest the flagship smartphone will include a Hasselblad-branded camera array. The images shared in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo"&gt;Dave Lee YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; show four cameras on the rear of the phone. These include wide-angle, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses, the latter of which appears to offer up to a 3.3x optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpmVKw"&gt;At this point it’s unclear exactly what this Hasselblad branding could mean for the OnePlus 9 Pro’s cameras. The Swedish manufacturer, which is majority owned by Chinese company DJI, is best known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977522/hasselblad-camera-factory-tour"&gt;expensive medium format cameras&lt;/a&gt;, and has previously worked with Lenovo on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/31/12729838/hasselblad-true-zoom-announced-moto-z"&gt;modular camera accessory&lt;/a&gt; for Moto Z devices, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/1834074858/vertu-signature-touch-comes-with-hasselblad-certified-camera"&gt;Vertu for its Signature Touch&lt;/a&gt; smartphone. Hopefully the presence of its logo means Hasselblad has provided some real camera expertise to OnePlus beyond just brand cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KebC9YVQFq7xAzJJeB1Vxo8e1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288892/Etj1c86XYAAlZz8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"&gt;Dave2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone appears to show four sensors with Hasselblad branding. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaPi35-N0f0we8x1RHW5WKQUW1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288895/msedge_l12Zzj4gLq.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLT6iDu8Ds&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank"&gt;Dave2D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If accurate, the images show the phone will have a curved display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IcVLnQ"&gt;While Dave Lee outlines three of the phone’s four rear cameras, it’s not obvious what the last sensor might be. Previous OnePlus phones have offered novelties like a &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-8-pro-color-camera-1105842/"&gt;color-filter camera&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/oneplus-8t-monochrome-camera/"&gt;black-and-while monochrome sensor&lt;/a&gt;. Dave Lee’s video mentions that the phone could have a built-in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography"&gt;tilt-shift photography mode&lt;/a&gt; that could relate to the fourth sensor, but it could equally just be a depth-sensing or macro camera based on OnePlus’ previous phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQRTXL"&gt;Beyond the camera array, the photos shared on the Dave2D channel corroborate a previous leak &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-9-specs-1195130/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that said the phone will include a curved 1440p 120Hz display. The device shown by Dave Lee appears to have an unusual 11GB of RAM (most other phones have 12GB or 8GB), and 256GB of internal storage. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;separate report&lt;/a&gt; previously claimed the phone will be able to fast-charge at 45W wirelessly, up from the OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless fast-charging speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0uHKC"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro is expected to be one of two or even three phones announced by the company next month, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-pro-leak-reveals-huge-camera-upgrade"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, we could see the OnePlus 9 (which itself was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174437/oneplus-9-photos-leak-2021-flagship"&gt;leaked in a series of photos&lt;/a&gt; last December), as well as a more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-lite-snapdragon-865-will-launch-alongside-oneplus-9-9-pro"&gt;OnePlus 9 Lite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel responds to Apple’s M1 chips with cherry-picked benchmarks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfHebaKEb_7gnbvLtZ7nMN8jS_c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785675/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPwR1N"&gt;The PC industry response to Apple’s new M1 chips has been rather quiet, until now. Intel is hitting back at Apple’s new M1 MacBooks with some benchmarks of its own, after early reviews showed impressive performance and battery life from Apple’s ARM-based chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0wO3H"&gt;In benchmarks &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-fires-back-at-apple-m1-processors-with-benchmarks"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Intel compares its 11th Gen Core i7 processor with the M1 CPU found in the latest MacBook Pro. Intel claims its latest chips beat Apple’s M1 performance by 30 percent in overall Chrome browsing tasks, and every one of its carefully selected Office 365 tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GtJ82NGhcpKKS9WA9AGG41A2Ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288889/iqo4nY26fUteofun3KTLv9_2048_80.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s productivity benchmarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1RXp7E"&gt;Intel’s benchmarks also include comparisons between HandBrake transcoding, Adobe Premiere Pro exports, and tasks in both Photoshop and Lightroom Classic. Intel’s 11th Gen chips beat Apple’s M1 in all of these tasks, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gHhsF"&gt;Intel also tested gaming across both chips, mainly to point out that most games aren’t available on macOS. Out of the games tested, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; all run at higher average framerates on the M1, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WuDfu"&gt;This range of benchmarks are clearly cherry picked to favor Intel’s chips, especially as some make use of Intel’s hardware acceleration. Most of the tests aren’t industry standard benchmarks, and Intel even swapped out the MacBook Pro it was testing with a MacBook Air specifically for the battery life tests. Reviewers have regularly found the MacBook Pro battery life to be superior to the MacBook Air and similar Windows laptops, but Intel used the Air for its comparisons to show it only beat PCs by six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6DxaWnAD-mOZWNIx9vfnV6O0fM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22288891/ruthcvQsRsqAKfARL9kWV4_2048_80.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s gaming performance benchmarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kq7YNZ"&gt;Intel also argues that PCs offer more choice, better peripheral compatibility, and multi-monitor support. These are particularly valid points, especially when you consider that the M1 MacBook Pro and Air only support a single external display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfHiC4"&gt;What Intel’s hand-picked benchmarks don’t really cover is the experience of using an M1 device compared to existing Intel-based MacBooks. Apple’s latest laptops are silent during most operations, with no loud fans spinning up, impressive battery life, and solid software compatibility. Apple’s processor transition to its own silicon has been surprisingly smooth, and this is just the first generation of chips to make it to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaNCXX"&gt;Intel is clearly concerned by Apple’s first chips, and we’re now waiting for the company to respond with its own processors instead of benchmarks. The entire PC industry will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;need to respond to Apple&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;laptop sales are growing&lt;/a&gt;. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, looks set to battle Apple’s M1 chips in the years ahead, and he’s already made it clear that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232554/intel-ceo-apple-lifestyle-company-cpus-comment"&gt;Intel has to beat Apple in the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk pledges $100 million for new X Prize carbon removal competition </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBaBOq"&gt;Elon Musk is putting up $100 million as part of a new X Prize Foundation competition focused on carbon removal technology. The contest, announced Monday morning, will run for four years and is open to teams around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlIy8k"&gt;Fifteen teams will be selected for the competition within 18 months. They will each get $1 million, and 25 separate $200,000 scholarships will be given to student teams who enter. The grand prize winner will be awarded $50 million, second place will receive $20 million, and third place will get $10 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP4Wok"&gt;Winners will have to “demonstrate a solution that can pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans and lock it away permanently in an environmentally benign way,” according to the X Prize Foundation. Judges will be looking for solutions that could remove one ton of CO2 per day that can scale to gigaton levels. Full competition guidelines will be published on April 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCSyxr"&gt;“We want to make a truly meaningful impact. Carbon negativity, not neutrality,” Musk says in a statement. “This is not a theoretical competition; we want teams that will build real systems that can make a measurable impact and scale to a gigaton level. Whatever it takes. Time is of the essence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4IhysU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Time is of the essence.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snjdCh"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1352392678177034242"&gt;first announced that he was donating money towards a prize in January&lt;/a&gt;, not long after he passed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;to become the richest person in the world&lt;/a&gt;. When that happened, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO asked his millions of Twitter followers for “ways to donate money that really make a difference.” The $100 million is coming from Musk’s own foundation. This donation &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221173/elon-musk-tesla-foundation-philanthropy-wealthiest-person"&gt;roughly doubles the amount he has publicly given away&lt;/a&gt; to date through the Musk Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crFJLk"&gt;Carbon removal technology is an expensive idea that’s still unproven at scale, with options ranging from funding reforestation projects to physically pulling the greenhouse gas out of the air. But it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/19/9174589/climate-change-carbon-removal-capture-air"&gt;become fashionable&lt;/a&gt; as the world heats up. It’s especially popular among major corporations. Last year, Stripe made it possible for businesses that use its payment processing platform to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537247/stripe-customers-carbon-capture-projects-climate-change"&gt;funnel portions of their proceeds towards the development of carbon removal&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlPy6a"&gt;Perhaps most notably, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt; that it wanted to capture the equivalent of all the carbon dioxide it’s ever emitted. The company pledged $1 billion toward the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfhIE7"&gt;Last month, we got the first glimpse at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;the slight progress Microsoft has made toward that goal&lt;/a&gt;. The company purchased contracts to capture 1.3 million metric tons of CO2, or just 11 percent of its total emissions for 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit bought a five-second Super Bowl spot celebrating GameStock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3cI8lD_kaSkdQef9dnRNt9XcU_0=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68785053/reddit.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jfgv5h"&gt;You could have been forgiven for missing Reddit’s Super Bowl ad tonight — it was only five seconds long. The ad mostly consisted of a text message that would’ve been pretty difficult to read in the moment, claiming that the company spent its “entire marketing budget on five seconds of airtime.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgoZcs"&gt;“One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish anything when they come together around a common idea,” Reddit says by way of explanation, in a clear nod to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;GameStop stocks saga&lt;/a&gt; that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;driven by posters on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. “Who knows, maybe you’ll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on ‘tendies.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vWCwFh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What just happened? &lt;a href="https://t.co/DypRp6DeQt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DypRp6DeQt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Reddit (@reddit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1358572629729320960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jmIYxG"&gt;You can watch the ad above, but here’s the full text in case it’s too small on your phone screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLBk2"&gt;Wow, this actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVeHPq"&gt;If you’re reading this, it means our bet paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyTNIm"&gt;Big game spots are expensive, so we couldn’t buy a full one. But we were inspired and decided to spend our entire marketing budget on 5 seconds of airtime. One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish anything when they come together around a common idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIRa32"&gt;Who knows, maybe you’ll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on “tendies.” Maybe you’ll help r/SuperbOwl teach the world about the majesty of owls. Maybe you’ll even pause this 5-second ad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzdkGw"&gt;Powerful things happen when people rally around something they really care about. And there’s a place for that. It’s called Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Hyundai and Kia downplay Apple car rumors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtyJah8ZmEBm-GjkmgmDzgzEYiM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784985/akrales_180329_2351_1103.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E24ucx"&gt;After weeks of speculation, Hyundai and subsidiary Kia have again sought to downplay rumors and reporting that they are working with Apple on an autonomous electric car project. The companies say they are no longer in talks, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-tech-apple-hyundai-motor/hyundai-motor-kia-say-they-are-not-in-talks-with-apple-on-autonomous-car-development-idUSS6N2J9020"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/apple-talks-with-hyundai-kia-on-electric-car-paused-recently"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, though that doesn’t mean the discussions won’t reopen later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjjot"&gt;Hyundai’s comments as reported by Bloomberg are essentially the same as what the company said last month in a statement that mentioned Apple before being confusingly walked back. The carmaker says it’s been discussing potential autonomous electric car projects with various partners but is yet to reach a decision. Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/apple-talks-with-hyundai-kia-on-electric-car-paused-recently"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week that the talks with Apple had “paused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJdq1t"&gt;Renowned Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261893/apple-electric-car-hyundai-ming-chi-kuo-rumor-report"&gt;believes&lt;/a&gt; that the company does indeed plan to use Hyundai’s E-GMP platform for its first electric vehicle and use Kia for US-based manufacturing, though even then he doesn’t expect the car to hit the market before 2025. Whatever the state of Apple and Hyundai’s negotiations, then, the project is unlikely to be unveiled any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CBS All Access app had technical difficulties at the start of the Super Bowl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CBS logo (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8AshmSXYwzy46uGHB5vHO14ZzA=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784702/cbs-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6e8Wv"&gt;CBS All Access app appeared to be having problems as users tried to watch Super Bowl LV on Sunday. Users reported seeing an error message that read the app was “experiencing technical difficulties” and that “an error has occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHGKjL"&gt;Down Detector showed a &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/cbs_all_access/"&gt;spike in complaints&lt;/a&gt; for CBS All Access at around 6PM ET Sunday. Numerous users were complaining on Twitter that they could not see the game at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHXL3D"&gt;Todd Spangler of &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reported shortly after 7PM ET that CBS was telling subscribers the issues were resolved and to restart the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL4JNH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GBQT2C"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CBS All Access crashed right around &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuperBowl?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuperBowl&lt;/a&gt; kickoff time, it's now telling subscribers "The reported technical issues with the service have been resolved, please restart your CBS All Access app and you can now return to streaming."&lt;/p&gt;— Todd Spangler (@xpangler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xpangler/status/1358568845867376640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TG58gh"&gt;It was the worst possible timing for the app to be unavailable as the Super Bowl between Kansas City and Tampa Bay was getting underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovbIa2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: February 7th, 7:18PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that the app should be working for most users. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5MX8I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailer for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier premieres during Super Bowl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZOOxnWu06snDWjJF5z2y_DnTVCU=/95x0:664x379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68784750/falcon.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Marvel/Disney Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LJzmNA"&gt;We had an inkling that there might be big movie news during the Super Bowl and there was: Marvel released a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, a six-episode series that debuts on Disney Plus March 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGSxoB"&gt;The show takes place after the events of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Steve Rogers has retired from as Captain America, in an attempt to live a simple life in an alternate reality with his love, Peggy Carter. Sam Wilson (Falcon) has picked up the Captain’s shield. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3DUNb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KL1OHB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWBsDaFWyTE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dywdhq"&gt;The show had been delayed a few times, and fans have only been able to see a brief, 30-second teaser before now. Filming shut down in March because of the pandemic, Disney said at the time, and was forced to remain shut down until a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRfEUQ"&gt;The trailer opens with our heroes being interviewed in what looks like a jail cell, and a therapist (?) asking “Mr. Barnes, why does Sam aggravate you?” Ha. Much jumping out of planes and flying around, shield-throwing and kicking of bad guys ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7JlQp"&gt;Check out the trailer above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHdA6o"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZW1qm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnTVuP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
