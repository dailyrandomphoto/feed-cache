    <title>What’s the difference between FDA approval and authorization?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a sign outside a large building that reads “US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HtJiP8IIB0uzVsWHcMvDfh-51o=/0x0:5741x3827/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549622/1227710766.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAwn27"&gt;In most contexts, it’s perfectly acceptable to use “approval” and “authorization” interchangeably. But not at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and definitely not when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. If the topic comes up at your Zoom holiday party, here’s a cheat sheet for the specific uses of these similar terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6guJm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approval — &lt;/strong&gt;No COVID-19 vaccines have been approved. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/approvals-fda-regulated-products/about-fda-product-approval"&gt;Approval&lt;/a&gt; means the FDA has officially decided that a product is safe and effective for its designated use. The process for approval involves rigorous reviews of all available data on the product and can take several months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMMosZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorization — &lt;/strong&gt;To speed things up in an emergency like a pandemic, the FDA can grant an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization"&gt;Emergency Use Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (EUA). An EUA, as its name implies, authorizes a product for use during unusually urgent circumstances if the benefits of its use outweigh any known or potential risks. A vaccine that combats a global pandemic is an ideal candidate for an EUA – we can’t afford to lose any more time in the midst of a crisis with an ever-climbing death toll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrW835"&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;granted an EUA for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s likely to do the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187693/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-committee-support"&gt;for the Moderna vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this week. As long as no serious harms from the vaccines are discovered, they’ll maintain authorization until the pandemic is over. At that point, the pharmaceutical companies will decide if they want to seek FDA approval. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, was granted an EUA for COVID-19 treatment in May before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529244/fda-remdesivir-approval-covid-19-treatment-gilead"&gt;gaining approval in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RryYAp"&gt;The expedited process for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines doesn’t mean decisions are being made willy-nilly. FDA reviewers still had to pore over all the currently available data from clinical trials before signing off on the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQ9ICd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BONUS ROUND: Clearance — &lt;/strong&gt;FDA clearance is usually applied to devices — anything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17855006/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-fda-approved-vs-cleared-meaning-safe"&gt;heart-monitoring apps on a smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; to X-ray machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPkoKv"&gt;The FDA groups medical devices into three classes based on the level of risk associated with their use. Low-stakes products like gauze and tongue depressors are Class I, while products like pacemakers are Class III. Devices in Class III are the only ones which require FDA approval before they can be put on the market. Those in Classes I and II don’t necessarily need to be approved to be marketed. If they’re a brand-new low-risk product, they can potentially get something called a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-submissions/de-novo-classification-request"&gt;De Novo classification&lt;/a&gt;. Others can be cleared by the FDA if they can show that they are similar enough to products that have already been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s Charli D’Amelio is bringing her entire family to Hulu with a new reality series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhSZzvHsebka7FgrGlo68wluIOo=/800x0:5120x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549594/1225293625.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/Getty Images for EIF &amp;amp; XQ&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyJ5Jc"&gt;Hulu has ordered a new reality series based around TikTok’s royal family — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/22/21571189/charli-damelio-100-million-tiktok-followers"&gt;Charli, Dixie, Marc, and Heidi D’Amelio&lt;/a&gt; — seemingly hoping to capture a little bit of what &lt;em&gt;Keeping Up with the Kardashians &lt;/em&gt;did for E! back in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDgcIz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show &lt;/em&gt;is an eight-part documentary series that will follow the four family members as they go about their day-to-day lives. Expect TikTok dancing, TikTok drama, meetings with executives all over Hollywood, and the types of goofs that worked for other reality shows that followed popular families. It will debut sometime in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc17Ng"&gt;For the D’Amelio family, this is just another project they’re adding to their list, which includes podcasts, a YouTube channel, commercials, television specials, and more. Like the Kardashians before them, the D’Amelios see an opportunity to create an empire out of the fame they’ve recently entered into. Charli, for example, has more than 100 million followers on TikTok — the most of anyone on the app. For Hulu, however, &lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show &lt;/em&gt;is a necessary addition for its lineup of reality shows and documentary series that the streamer is banking on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ti5v4H"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show&lt;/em&gt; joins our growing slate of docuseries about the human experience and we’re incredibly excited to partner with the D’Amelio family to offer viewers an authentic look at the complicated lives of these two relatable young women thrust to the top of the social media algorithm,” Belisa Balaban, vice president of documentaries at Hulu, said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIgp3j"&gt;Just recently, Hulu announced that it signed a massive &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/kardashians-sign-major-global-content-deal-with-disney-hulu.html"&gt;deal with the Kardashian family&lt;/a&gt; for new content (not &lt;em&gt;Keeping Up&lt;/em&gt;, which the family announced was ending). Hulu also has reality shows like &lt;em&gt;Taste The Nation with Padma Lakshmi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Eater’s Guide To The World&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming series&lt;em&gt; The Next Thing You Eat &lt;/em&gt;from David Chang&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Planet Sex&lt;/em&gt; with Cara Delevingne&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfI3fi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclosure: Eater is a Vox Media brand and sister site to &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3c4SGx"&gt;Having the most popular TikTok family also available in a series exclusive to Hulu helps with that growing content arm; an area that Netflix has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328481/netflix-franchise-movies-tv-shows-reality-tv-reed-hastings-ted-sarandos"&gt;invested heavily&lt;/a&gt; in over the last couple of years as the genre successfully grows. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22018581/discovery-streaming-service-launch-date-price-shark-week-hgtv-food-network"&gt;Discovery Plus launching&lt;/a&gt; in just a few weeks, it’ll also give Hulu some space to compete in the docuseries and reality TV realm, which Discovery (TLC, Food Network, HGTV) owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gU2Rjm"&gt;Whether or not &lt;em&gt;The D’Amelio Show &lt;/em&gt;winds up being the cultural success that &lt;em&gt;Keeping Up with the Kardashians &lt;/em&gt;was in its earlier seasons depends on if people want to see the D’Amelio family in a longer, more narrative-driven space instead of just 60 seconds at a time on their phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8zLm7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtxOgA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMhbQb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GCqmY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RxcwE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy is accepting Cyberpunk 2077 returns through December 21st, even if you played it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWt4XkU7gjHEJOxyG66qO6Sv_f4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549520/Cyberpunk_2077_screen_8.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4A33i"&gt;Best Buy has joined the list of retailers offering returns for copies of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, with the company announcing (&lt;a href="https://forums.bestbuy.com/t5/Gaming-Support/Cyberpunk-2077-Refund/td-p/1372500/page/2"&gt;in a forum post&lt;/a&gt;) that it’ll be accepting returns through December 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzPgBP"&gt;The move is an unusual one for Best Buy, which &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Freturn-exchange-policy%2Fpcmcat260800050014.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat260800050014%26CMP%3Docss&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;typically excludes&lt;/a&gt; opened video games from its usual return policy — in most circumstances, “opened physical copies of computer software, movies, music, video games, books, video game guides and sheet music can only be exchanged for an identical item.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P9CwtT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cyberpunk 2077 developer says disappointed players can ask for refunds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="U9JQmC"&gt;However, in light of developer CD Projekt Red’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173738/cyberpunk-2077-developer-apologizes-base-ps4-xbox-one-performance-issues-refunds"&gt;own acknowledgement of issues&lt;/a&gt; with the game — and its offer to supply refunds through December 21st — Best Buy will be offering a similar opportunity for disappointed buyers to return their copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaMvAL"&gt;Per the forum post: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8JUr4W"&gt;Normally, Best Buy is unable to offer returns of opened game software per our Return &amp;amp; Exchange Promise here. However, after some deliberation, and seeing that the vendor will be allowing returns through 12/21/2020, Best Buy will also be allowing returns for select opened Cyberpunk 2077 SKU’s through December 21, 2020. Beyond that date, we will return to our normal Return &amp;amp; Exchange Promise for the game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="69XRhh"&gt;There are a few things that Best Buy customers will need to keep in mind. First off, Best Buy is only accepting returns for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; on PS4 and Xbox One (including the regular, collectors, and digital editions of the game) — disappointed PC players won’t be able to get a refund, though. Additionally, the company notes that customers who choose to take advantage of Best Buy’s free SteelBook cases for the game will have to return those, too, or else have the value of the SteelBook deducted from their refund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxHvOt"&gt;Best Buy is the latest retailer that’s allowing refunds of the game following the widespread issues with the title on the original PS4 and Xbox One. Since CD Projekt Red’s announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;Sony has offered players full refunds&lt;/a&gt;, while also taking the unprecedented step of pulling the title for purchase entirely from the PlayStation store. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;Microsoft has similarly announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be offering full refunds for the game, although it’ll continue to sell it for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzYI1S"&gt;CD Projekt Red is already working on patches to improve performance, with one patch due out in the coming days, while more substantial updates are planned for both January and February to help address “the most prominent issues” on original Xbox One and PS4 hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Chromebook 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook for every type of user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GGbxNY"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Android apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chromebook can be more useful than a mediocre Windows laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2020 is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many of the best Chromebooks are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the Lenovo Chromebook Duet as the best Chromebook for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2020 include the Asus Chromebook Flip C434, Google Pixelbook Go, the Google Pixelbook, and the HP Chromebook x360. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4UgFhp"&gt;An honorable mention is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous laptop with a unique color and 4K AMOLED display, which didn’t quite make this list because of its unfortunately short battery life. We’re looking forward to reviewing Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook with a thin 2-in-1 design, and the affordable IdeaPad Flex 3 Chromebook which has a unique chassis and an SD card reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebooks 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 10th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QjxyUU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KoNNR1"&gt;3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d76D4s"&gt;Best 14-inch Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nprrDB"&gt;Asus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It’s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that’s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo"&gt;best Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; have been doing lately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMlKx4"&gt;Asus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there’s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTxl8W"&gt;There’s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage — and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn’t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;4. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZOrDL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508145"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a premium design, the Google Pixelbook is a good Chromebook for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oKAVKP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="UgIG1H"&gt;Thin Chromebook with beautiful hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ptwU2G"&gt;Google hasn’t updated the Pixelbook since its 2017 release, but if you’re looking for a convertible premium Chromebook, it’s still competitive. It has a beautiful design, combining aluminum and Gorilla Glass with silicone palm rests, and sports a bright touchscreen with 2400 x 1600 resolution. The 3:2 aspect ratio offers extra space compared to 16:9 panels and makes it more comfortable to work in multiple apps and windows without having to zoom out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rv26rE"&gt;The Pixelbook doesn’t have the latest Intel processors since it’s an older product. Still, its Core i5 and 8GB of RAM should be able to handle everyday browsing and multitasking just fine. We also got around eight hours of battery life under a fairly heavy load. The keyboard and touchpad are both fun and comfortable to use — and as a neat bonus, the speakers fire up through the hinge, so audio sounds clearer than it does on many convertible laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvzNEI"&gt;Note: Google appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449640/google-pixelbook-discontinue-chromebook-laptop"&gt;discontinuing the Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, but some models are still available through Google’s store and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="X6cCFz"&gt;8. Samsung Chromebook Plus v2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Samsung Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E0uFW7"&gt;The convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 is far from a budget purchase. But it does offer a lot for its price, including a built-in battery-free stylus and an extra front-facing camera for quick photos of blackboards or job sites. (The camera above the keyboard is also surprisingly high-resolution — it’s a 13-megapixel sensor with autofocus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKmhZX"&gt;The V2 also has a nice design on par with that of other premium Chromebooks, including an aluminum lid and a sturdy hinge. It’s fairly portable at 2.9 pounds, and it has a microSD slot in addition to its two USB-C ports and headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re able to spend a bit extra for some serious power, the Asus Chromebook Flip C436 is a good Chromebook for you, offering great battery life and a super light build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URploe"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21206912/asus-chromebook-flip-c436-review-chromeos-android"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C436&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WREbTq"&gt;A pricey, premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DSD92E"&gt;Disappointing battery life (just over five hours of multitasking and seven hours of looping video) and a hefty price tag keep the Chromebook Flip C436 from topping this list, especially considering the lower price but similar offerings of its predecessor, the Chromebook Flip C434. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4Kg8L"&gt;Still, if money isn’t an object for you, there’s a lot to like about the 2-in-1 C436. It has a nice, compact, convertible chassis — unlike many convertible devices, it’s actually light enough (2.4 pounds) to feasibly be used as a tablet for an extended period of time. Inside, it has a comfortable and snappy keyboard and a fingerprint reader in the top corner of the deck. The audio is good: there are two Harman Kardon-certified speakers in the hinge, as well as one on each side of the cover. And it’s powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 that performs quite well under a heavy browsing load. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqzqH2"&gt;The C436 is a pricey Chromebook, but it certainly looks and feels premium. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot confirms it’s making a League of Legends MMO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMzGVF7V7nNIOr6om5P8X5CoU3Y=/0x13:1920x1293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68549006/patch_10_25_banner.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Riot Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gXRhON"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games is working on a massively multiplayer online (MMO) roleplaying game in the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe, Riot’s VP of IP and entertainment, Greg Street, tweeted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIocDX"&gt;“My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to need!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339722821761605632"&gt;Street said&lt;/a&gt;. “My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.” If the deliberate use of the word “massive” in that quote wasn’t enough of a hint, in a reply to another Twitter user, Street confirmed the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520"&gt;is an MMO&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l2idUn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I have news!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My recent job at Riot has been to help develop the League universe, which we’re going to need!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because it is time. My new job is to kick off a big (some might say massive) game that many of you, and many Rioters, have been asking us to create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PS We’re hiring&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Street (@Ghostcrawler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339722821761605632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="so9ndz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It is an MMO&lt;/p&gt;— Greg Street (@Ghostcrawler) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1339724117973483520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6I3HSy"&gt;The new MMO isn’t entirely surprising, as Riot has been working to expand the &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; universe into other games and mediums as of late. Riot has released a &lt;a href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League-&lt;/em&gt;themed card game&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/teamfight-tactics"&gt;auto-battler&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, the company plans to launch a mobile and console version of the main game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519658/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a spinoff &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012514/league-of-legends-riot-indie-game-ruined-king-the-game-awards-tga"&gt;single-player, turn-based RPG&lt;/a&gt; for consoles and PC&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;An animated series, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, is also scheduled &lt;a href="https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/an-update-on-arcane/"&gt;for 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and there are two &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/19/12970138/league-of-legends-mechs-vs-minions-board-game"&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408504/league-of-legends-tellstones-board-game-spinoff"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; that further flesh out the lore. Riot appears to be following the same formula as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In fact, the studio even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18099147/league-of-legends-marvel-comics-game-lore-riot"&gt;partnered with Marvel for &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; comic books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCFgeB"&gt;Street worked on &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; for nearly six years, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgreg-street-b356447%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F18%2F22187980%2Friot-games-league-of-legends-mmo-greg-street#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;his LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, so hopefully he can bring some of what has made that game such a hit to this new &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; MMO.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft offers Cyberpunk 2077 refunds for all digital sales, but it’s not pulling the game</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LOcvFI"&gt;Microsoft says it’s now offering &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; refunds to anyone who has purchased the game via its Microsoft Store. While the company has been offering refunds to some customers already, Microsoft is now expanding this to cover anyone who has purchased the game digitally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DczLQQ"&gt;“We know the developers at CD Projekt Red have worked hard to ship Cyberpunk in extremely challenging circumstances,” explains a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “However, we also realize that some players have been unhappy with the current experience on older consoles. To date, we have granted refunds to the vast majority of customers who have requested one. To ensure that every player is able to get the experience they expect on Xbox, we will be expanding our existing refund policy to offer full refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 digitally from the Microsoft Store, until further notice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KrIuTo"&gt;The refund policy expansion follows days of complaints around bugs, crashes, and the way the game runs on base PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Sony also moved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;refund unhappy &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; players&lt;/a&gt; this week and even removed the game from the PlayStation Store. Microsoft isn’t going as far as Sony to fully remove the game, as the title is still listed and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fcyberpunk-2077%2Fbx3m8l83bbrw%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYrJhR"&gt;Sony and Microsoft’s moves to refund players come just days after &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red said people unsatisfied with their purchase on the PS4 or Xbox One should request a refund. CD Projekt Red has also committed to releasing patches to improve the game, with one due in the coming days and more significant patches planned for January and February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skype now has Microsoft Teams’ fun Together Mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vuv3FYeKtBiGFITzhHOhbzhoI7M=/4x0:1627x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548817/skypetogethermode.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s new Together Mode option featuring Verge staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KqZmXl"&gt;Microsoft is bringing one of its best Teams video calling features over to Skype this week. Together Mode, which uses AI to segment your face and shoulders and place you together with other people in a virtual space, is now available in Skype. You’ll need at least five people all with webcams to enable the feature, and it will place everyone into a virtual environment as if they’re sitting next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Bdap"&gt;You don’t even need the Skype app to take advantage of Together Mode, as it works through the web version of Skype without the need for an account. Skype users can create a Meet Now meeting and share the link with anyone to join.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6dUER3FAs8UqN3HoqQp7y0Y4Do=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20073111/togethermode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together Mode in Microsoft Teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2hXemb"&gt;Microsoft first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;launched Together Mode&lt;/a&gt; back in July for pandemic-era meetings, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21337326/nba-microsoft-teams-together-mode-basketball-virtual-experience-fans"&gt;NBA started using the feature&lt;/a&gt; to bring basketball fans courtside in a virtual experience during live games. Still, it’s surprising to see a Microsoft Teams feature make its way to Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbTqY3"&gt;Millions of people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232401/zoom-300-million-users-growth-coronavirus-pandemic-security-privacy-concerns-response"&gt;flocked to Zoom&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when the pandemic forced many to work from home and socialize with friends through video calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200844/microsoft-skype-zoom-houseparty-coronavirus-pandemic-usage-growth-competition"&gt;Skype largely missed out on this big moment&lt;/a&gt;, as Microsoft has increasingly turned its focus toward Teams for video calling and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jabnqG"&gt;Alongside this new Together Mode feature, Microsoft is also adding its Large Grid Mode feature to Skype so you can see everyone’s video stream at the same time. This &lt;a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/release-notes-for-skype-867/38e7d783-fa26-4289-a857-7f6056c633de"&gt;latest version of Skype&lt;/a&gt;, available across Windows, Mac, Linux, and the web, also includes more background options and lets people add friends to ongoing calls by using their phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There is no ‘best’ time to release new Mandalorian episodes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2OFG9yQ5xP5A7au0JRIwfWzYzI=/75x0:483x272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548489/mando_finale.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hm4zrI"&gt;For the last eight weeks, waking up on Friday morning has come with a gamble for many &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans: check Twitter to see the latest headlines &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188706/the-mandalorian-season-2-episode-8-rescue-star-wars-grogu-skywalker-saga"&gt;watch the new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; before anyone has a chance to spoil it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV4Rjt"&gt;This week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a perfect example. The second season finale includes some moments that Twitter’s trending tags and “news for you” curated topic sideline are already ruining. Without getting into spoiler territory here (and use this as a warning to stay away from Twitter if you haven’t seen the finale yet), one of the proposed solutions to this problem seems simple: release the episodes at a later time. Instead of dropping episodes at 3AM ET, why not pivot to 8 or 9PM ET, similar to how &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;used its 9PM slot on Sundays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZQUuj"&gt;It’s complicated, and it’s important to remember the desire to change the time episodes drop is largely coming from a US audience. There are a couple of key factors to remember here that didn’t impact &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;quite as much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uAjBwy"&gt;Disney Plus is a global streaming service that debuts its originals at the same time in every region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DlJGiN"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a family show, enjoyed by young kids as well as adults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GqGye0"&gt;Having episodes up early on Friday gives people the weekend to enjoy if they don’t care about spoilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hBW8J1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;didn’t run into many of these issues. HBO is still a primarily domestic service, with episodes airing in international territories through other carriers (like Sky in the UK) the next day. HBO can focus on its American audience because that’s where the majority of its customers are. Disney can’t. About 25 percent of Disney Plus’ overall subscriber base is &lt;a href="https://www.afaqs.com/news/media/of-868-million-disney-subscribers-30-are-from-disney-hotstar-company-is-eyeing-350-million-subs-globally-by-2024"&gt;signed up through Hotstar in India&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is rapidly rolling out the streamer to other big regions, like Latin America. While the US is still a major market, it’s not the sole area Disney has to focus on. And 9PM ET on Sunday is too late or too early for a number of other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUueo0"&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;also isn’t a family show. Sure, families &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;watch it together, but it’s likely not the type of series that parents are sitting down with their seven-year-old child to watch. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is a show that families with young kids watch together — Baby Yoda is more than just a plot device — and 9PM ET is too late. This came up in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack today when I was complaining about waking up at 6:30AM to watch the episode before starting work, which requires Twitter. 9AM ET is great for the UK crowd (5PM their time), but it’s still early, and it’s even earlier for the West Coast of the US. While it seemed like 7 or 8PM ET would be a good compromise, that means it’s 4PM PT for the West Coast crowd (a little early on Friday) and midnight for people in the UK. Better, and one that I prefer, but not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kqm3s"&gt;Then there’s the most obvious point: not everyone who is watching &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is starting their days with Twitter or Instagram or TikTok. They might not even see the spoilers — or they possibly don’t care. What a blissful life! For these &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;fans, having the episode drop early on Friday gives them Friday evening and the entire weekend to watch whenever they want. This question — “What is the best time to release new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episodes?” — doesn’t apply to them, really, because they’re not bothered by spoilers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zG5QvU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The Mandalorian’ &lt;/em&gt;is a show that families with young kids watch together, and 9PM ET is too late&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vhqDaZ"&gt;Is there a good time to release new &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episodes? Depending on who you ask and where they live, the answer varies — but the reason people are asking for episodes at a certain time doesn’t. Fans want that feeling of appointment viewing back. It’s a phrase that we last used with &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad &lt;/em&gt;before it. It’s the anticipation of a new episode (&lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;certainly has that) and making sure you’re situated in front a TV or laptop or phone right when the episode begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzTRaC"&gt;By the time the episode ends, Twitter is full of jokes and gasps depending on what played out over the last few minutes. Friends who have gotten together for watch parties are bouncing. Memes start spreading. Watching a big show feels more like a communal affair than a solitary activity — something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22151466/avengers-endgame-disney-2020-black-widow-infinity-war-pandemic-streaming-theaters"&gt;we really needed this year&lt;/a&gt;. People want &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;earlier or later because they &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to experience it with the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOt21n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is the biggest TV event of the year. It’s the thing that rolls around every Friday and we bemoan our friends to hurry up and finish watching because we want to talk about it. People are waking up at different times, they’re busy with kids in the morning, or have any number of other priorities that mean they can’t sit down and watch &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;at 6 or 7 in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfLhnw"&gt;It’s nearly impossible to find a perfect time that works for everyone, so releasing episodes at midnight PT &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;make the most sense, especially in a streaming-dominant world where preference and choice define the watching experience. It just sucks that an event-type show as big as &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;can’t really ever create the same beautiful, appointment TV, communal viewing experience that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;provided. I predict it’s an issue we’ll see grow as the major streamers expand globally. Think &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, but again and again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep the bike boom from fizzling out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1Am_c5giPcg6onGRkpdlHj42xM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68548275/VRG_ILLO_4348_BikeBoom.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Og6Kxu"&gt;This year, millions of people turned to bicycles as a safe and socially distanced way to get out of their homes, shake off that cabin fever, and get some fresh air, and suddenly — thanks to COVID — bikes were &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt;. But unless concerted efforts are made to ensure people can continue to cycle safely and in great numbers, all those bikes may soon be gathering dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqrAXv"&gt;Things looked grim at first, with bike sales plummeting as cities went into lockdown. But as the year plodded along, bike sales started really getting up to speed. Popular bikes went on backorder. Local shops and big-box retailers struggled to keep up with demand. The humble bicycle emerged as one of the rare winners of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MBJDR"&gt;For the first time in, well, a century, the playing field was tilted in favor of bikes. Driving rates dropped around the world as people sheltered in place. Cities closed down streets to cars to encourage walking and biking, or repurposed parking spaces for outdoor dining. Some cities, like Paris, Brussels, Seattle, and Oakland, announced plans to make these spaces permanently car-free, in the hopes of encouraging more sustainable transportation to fight climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y0yuPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For the first time in, well, a century, the playing field was tilted in favor of bikes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s6UlMX"&gt;But the cars are coming back because the cars always come back. Vehicle miles traveled in the US were only down 9 percent in September compared to last year, after dropping nearly 40 percent in April during the height of the first wave. The cycling community is worried about the sustainability of this latest boom. “This could be a once-in-a-generation chance to bolster our ranks by sharing the joy of cycling,” &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a32781813/keep-new-riders/"&gt;Eben Weiss wrote in &lt;em&gt;Bicycling &lt;/em&gt;magazine in June&lt;/a&gt;. “The last thing we need is to send these new riders back to their SUVs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxsnHw"&gt;The need for the bike boom to roll on beyond the pandemic is about more than the love of cycling, though. You’ll literally breathe easier when you start replacing more car trips with bicycles. We’re talking less carbon emissions, less traffic congestion, and a healthier population — the essential ingredients that make people happier and less stressed out. In the &lt;a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/WHR20.pdf"&gt;World Happiness Report 2020&lt;/a&gt;, countries with &lt;a href="https://ecf.com/resources/cycling-facts-and-figures"&gt;high bicycle use&lt;/a&gt; tend to be among the happiest overall, like the Netherlands (ranked sixth; daily bike use: 43 percent), Denmark (ranked second; daily bike use: 30 percent), and Finland (ranked first; daily bike use: 28 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnDSo7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bike boom, by the numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0t01z"&gt;A staggering $4.1 billion worth of bikes (excluding e-bikes) were sold in the US between January and October 2020, a 62 percent increase over the same period in 2019, according to the NPD Group, which tracks retail trends. E-bikes showed even more momentum, with $490.8 million in US sales for a 144 percent increase year over year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7alosh"&gt;It’s not just in the US, of course. Europeans are projected to buy an extra 10 million bikes per year by 2020, a whopping 47 percent more than the annual number in 2019. And China, where most of the world’s bikes are manufactured, exported over 40 million bikes in the first nine months of 2020, a number four times the EU’s annual bike production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28dqiS"&gt;Major bike manufacturers saw a huge windfall, with companies like Giant and Dorel (parent of Cannondale, Schwinn, Mongoose, and Pacific) reporting substantial revenue increases throughout the year. And popular e-bike brands like VanMoof, Rad Power Bikes, Gocycle, and many others all say they are doing record sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiBk4u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haters gonna hate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJcd9I"&gt;Wall Street is betting that the bike boom will eventually fizzle because they’re ghouls who don’t believe we can have nice things. (Kidding, kidding — please don’t tank my retirement account.) Actually, they assume that Americans will eventually ditch their new two-wheeled friends once a vaccine is widely available — which is a pretty low opinion of our level of commitment, so it’s probably accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBCKBR"&gt;Bike stocks plunged last month on the news that Pfizer had developed an effective coronavirus vaccine, &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/11/13/wall-street-thinks-the-bike-boom-is-over-and-thats-the-problem/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Streetsblog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Giant fell 9 percent, Dorel Sports fell 7.6 percent, and bike parts maker Shimano fell 13.1 percent in one day. A month later, those stocks are still trading lower than at their summer peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5tdVUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Our enthusiasm for bikes has waxed and waned in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvyNVL"&gt;Our enthusiasm for bikes has waxed and waned in the past. The invention of the “safety bicycle” with its chain-driven transmission in the 1890s led to one of the biggest bike crazes of all, but it couldn’t survive the advent of the automobile. Another boom in the 1970s, spurred both by the introduction of 10-speed derailleur racing bikes and the oil crisis, faded after gas prices became more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nH4SB5"&gt;Bikes may once again be flying off the shelf, but &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-biking-driving-commute-aa3b4059-958f-4f82-b84f-b0f6d486468c.html"&gt;Americans are actually biking less than in previous years&lt;/a&gt;. This is likely due to the steep drop in overall commuting rates as more workers chose to work from home. It would seem that recreational biking isn’t enough to offset the difference. But we’re also driving a lot less, too. It remains to be seen how it will shake out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoPX3u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to sustain the boom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL9Yc9"&gt;It gives me no joy to report that our best hope to keep people riding bicycles may rest with the federal government. The upside is the fixes may be as simple as providing money to cities for protected bike lanes, as well as approving financial incentives like tax credits for new bike and e-bike purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4opw4"&gt;The best way the government can encourage more cycling is to reform automobile regulations, which is likely a heavier lift. Currently, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) assigns safety ratings to new cars and trucks through its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). But this rating is based solely on risks posed to automobile occupants — and not the danger posed to vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E8z6J9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It gives me no joy to report that our best hope may rest with the federal government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rV2LKF"&gt;The number of cycling fatalities grew &lt;a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/historical-fatality-trends/deaths-by-type-of-incident/"&gt;38 percent from 2008 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the US recorded the highest number of pedestrian deaths in 30 years. This is related to the increase in big SUV and truck sales. The number of pedestrians killed by drivers of oversized vehicles has skyrocketed by 81 percent in the last decade, according to a report released last year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb1Ly3"&gt;The European Union’s version of the NCAP is different and obviously better. Vehicles receive a five-star review only if they can demonstrate an ability to come to a complete halt — or at least slow down — before colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. Under President Obama, NHTSA began the process of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/12/16/2015-31323/new-car-assessment-program"&gt;revising NCAP to address safety of those outside the vehicle&lt;/a&gt;; under President Trump, that effort was abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0vgim"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden could easily revive these efforts. And given Biden’s affinity for two-wheeled transportation — the incoming president spent a recent Saturday on what looked to be a &lt;a href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a34728527/joe-jill-biden-delaware-bike-ride/"&gt;delightful bike jaunt around the paved trails of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware&lt;/a&gt; — there is hope that he will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaqcSL"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it will be a fight. Or more accurately, it will be a turf war, as bikes will need to take physical space away from cars to maintain any forward momentum. But there are a lot of positive signs that bikes can gain the upper hand. Bike-share systems are setting records for ridership, and the popularity of electric scooters are helping to send the message to cities that a commitment to protecting the environment starts with protecting those who choose two wheels over four. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJgW5h"&gt;The push to protect cyclists and encourage more biking began long before COVID; let’s keep the fight going after the pandemic is over. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTMjBY"&gt;It seems like there’s no sign of tech news stopping for the holidays. In &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;last regular episode of 2020, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn and Nilay Patel bring on senior reporter Adi Robertson and editor Chris Welch to explain the biggest stories in tech from this past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jd5sEh"&gt;In the first half of the show, Adi explains two (!) more antitrust cases brought against Google this week: one from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas attorney general&lt;/a&gt; and the other from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;a coalition of 38 states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;breaks down their arguments about Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior around ad tech and search manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2gnAW"&gt;In the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; shift gears to a review of the latest product announcement from Apple: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;the AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;. Chris reviewed the new $550 headphones for the site, and he details his experience on the show — from comfortability to design and sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaKqS2"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like a privacy debate between Facebook and Apple, some rumors about the next Samsung flagship phones, and the ability to “ProRAW” image capture on the iPhone 12 Pro — so listen through to hear it all. &lt;/p&gt;
