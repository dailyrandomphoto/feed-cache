    <title>Ludwig’s livestream was interrupted by a copyright warning days after joining YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDebIKeFdsOfEX217bwtUVrhZEw=/208x0:2620x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70228280/ludwig_youtube_suspended_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ludwig via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=API5Lt8t7Ho" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3oQbdo"&gt;Just three days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808873/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-subathon-youtube-gaming"&gt;Ludwig Ahgren left his massive Twitch following for YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he was hit with what he thought was a suspension from the platform. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/former-twitch-subathon-star-ludwig-suspended-days-after-1848156400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ahgren was playing other YouTube videos during his stream, when he landed on the infamously catchy &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; song. His stream was shut down shortly thereafter, giving his viewers — and himself — the impression that he was banned for violating YouTube’s copyright policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LSzvcl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;you could say the switch has been going well... &lt;a href="https://t.co/dnkjSUkT0o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dnkjSUkT0o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1466576027858001928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzAuO"&gt;However, Ahgren wasn’t actually struck with a copyright strike or a suspension. “Ludwig wasn’t suspended,” Lauren Verrusio, the head of creator and consumer communications at YouTube told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Our Content ID tool picked up his playing of an unlicensed video while he was going live to fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSufM1"&gt;The whole incident was just a case of confusion. “If Ludwig were to have just stopped playing the copyrighted material, he could have continued the livestream just fine,” Verrusio explained. “But he wasn’t sure of what he was seeing on the backend and thought it was a suspension.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx7RrR"&gt;Ludwig addressed the incident in a video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDPKQb86Qw0"&gt;his secondary channel&lt;/a&gt;, in which he interprets the warning as a ban. “I’m pretty sure the corporate overlords who own &lt;em&gt;Baby Shark&lt;/em&gt; have, like, an iron fist on YouTube, and so they took me down.” Verrusio notes that YouTube is in touch with Ahgren to explain the platform’s copyright rules, and that Ludwig plans on going live again today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0k1Y"&gt;DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, has caused issues across all video sharing and livestreaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18635904/copyright-youtube-creators-dmca-takedown-fair-use-music-cover"&gt;with creators getting videos unknowingly taken down and demonetized&lt;/a&gt; for having copyrighted material. Earlier this year, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335929/twitch-dmca-vod-mass-delete-copyright-strike-dmca"&gt;rolled out a tool&lt;/a&gt; that makes it easier to delete old videos that contain copyrighted music, and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458481/twitch-streamers-dmca-takedown-wave-warning-notice"&gt;issued a wave of copyright strikes&lt;/a&gt; in response to DMCA complaints. Like Twitch, YouTube also operates with a three-strike policy — accrue three copyright violations and you’re permanently banned. To help soften DMCA’s blow, YouTube started telling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335728/youtube-checks-monetization-copyright-claim-dispute-tool"&gt;creators if their content contains copyrighted material&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; their videos are posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJkTE5"&gt;As Ludwig gets acquainted with his new streaming hub, his mistakes are likely to go unnoticed. He currently has 2.19 million subscribers on YouTube, with more bound to trickle in from what’s left of his fanbase on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buy two Nintendo Switch games and get one free at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R1nc4AQVlNYnmJd0H9GbpL8v5uY=/222x0:840x412/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70227915/Screenshot_2021_12_03_144418.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Buy two, get one free&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bLY7np"&gt;Best Buy is still hosting its mix-and-match sale featuring some excellent titles from the Nintendo Switch game library. Right now you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf77Eria2mK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a third game of equal or lesser value for free if you buy two other select titles&lt;/a&gt;. This offer includes first-party titles like &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis: Aces&lt;/em&gt; that rarely see discounts. While this offer is limited to 11 titles, this is one of the best ways to stock up on games that are exclusive to the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TtZyEq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The next N64 game for Nintendo Switch Online is Paper Mario","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22815382/n64-switch-paper-mario-release-date-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XSyRF2"&gt;While not quite as enticing as Black Friday prices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf77ITyjJM2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy has discounted all models of the 11-inch iPad Pro that launched in 2020, with some versions receiving discounts of up to $200&lt;/a&gt;. This tablet is available with up to 1TB of built-in storage and comes with many of the same features you’ll find on the latest version, except the M1 processor. This includes USB-C charging, a 120Hz refresh rate display, and dual-lens rear cameras. However, if you’re in the market for something with a bit more screen real estate, Best Buy is offering similar discounts on 2020 model of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NHuXli"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10692708" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNsYYC"&gt;The Brydge Pro Plus is a quick and easy way to transform your iPad into a MacBook. Currently, Brydge is offering the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D31717947441257&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F4%2F22816014%2Fnintendo-switch-games-asus-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-apple-ipad-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11-inch version of this combination screen protector and keyboard for $120&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-pro-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D31717947408489&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F4%2F22816014%2Fnintendo-switch-games-asus-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-apple-ipad-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch for $130&lt;/a&gt;, taking $30 and $40 off the regular prices, respectively. This case is designed to closely emulate the classic look and feel of the backlit keyboard on the MacBook Pro and even includes a trackpad in its list of features. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206568/brydge-pro-plus-review-ipad-pro-keyboard-trackpad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Byford noted in his review&lt;/a&gt; that the Brydge Pro Plus transforms the iPad Pro into a convenient laptop form factor, even though some of the gestures you can use on the Apple magic keyboard aren’t available here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Czgpgd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OvhcNP"&gt;Ponder having your own personal orb that you can talk to with this sweet discount on the latest Echo Dot. This version of the spherical speaker is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749437417640247273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $30, its lowest price ever. This omnidirectional speaker boasts all the functionality of previous Alexa-enabled speakers, just in a slightly more attractive form factor. It still features top-mounted touch controls, and is available in black, white, or blue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pDW4hB"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf77LBUaeWf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32-inch curved Asus TUF Gaming Monitor is currently discounted to just $290 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, taking $100 off the regular price. This monitor features a 165Hz refresh rate and  1440p resolution, as well as support for AMD FreeSync to help minimize screen tearing. This model features a pair of HDMI inputs as well as a DisplayPort jack, and a 3.5mm audio jack for headphones. The stand’s height, tilt, and swivel can be adjusted, but the monitor also supports VESA mount, if you’d prefer a wall-mounted or arm-based solution. This is one of the better prices we’ve seen for a monitor with these specs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wISf2y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9739259"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R39XwA"&gt;The 15-inch Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop is still discounted to its Black Friday price. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf8e6fNlSML" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering this capable laptop for $1,900&lt;/a&gt;, knocking $300 off the regular retail price. This laptop comes equipped with a a QHD display, an RTX 3080, an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for storage. Like virtually all of the gaming laptops available at Best Buy, the G15 also comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a perfect combo for playing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; on launch day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E293gW"&gt;Monica Chin was thoroughly impressed with the Zephyrus G15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/search?q=Asus+ROG+Zephyrus+G15" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in her review&lt;/a&gt; (though she tested the RTX 3070 model), and it even occupies the top spot for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our favorite gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;. Unless you absolutely need a built-in webcam, which this model lacks, the Zephyrus G15 is otherwise an excellent choice for your next gaming laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zu235T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10385239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Call of Duty made $3 billion in 2020, so of course Activision Blizzard is laying off QA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2-z5N5MzDtg9qct8KVPvd_3pBgA=/0x0:1623x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70227150/WZP_S1_ANNOUNCEMENT_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ti08sJ"&gt;One of the studios responsible for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s success is laying off QA testers that are reportedly earning $17 an hour for their work on the franchise &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201204005140/en/"&gt;Activision Blizzard said&lt;/a&gt; brought in $3 billion dollars in 2020. Raven Software, known for its work on &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CoD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; has now laid off a third of its contract QA testers, according to reports &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-qa-testers-face-layoffs-after-reportedly-b-1848159708"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/raven-software-layoffs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73PVfY"&gt;Raven’s Associate Community Manager Austin O’Brien said that team members were&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eyyohbee/status/1466890788235878409?s=20"&gt; being called into individual meetings&lt;/a&gt; to be told whether or not they would still have a job come January 28th. So far, the company has reportedly laid off about a third of its QA testers, or around a dozen people, but it’s possible more could follow&lt;em&gt;. The Post&lt;/em&gt; quotes an anonymous Raven contractor who said that “everyone was told, ‘you did nothing wrong,’ after being given the bad news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vqcsY"&gt;A Better ABK, an employee advocacy group, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1466937163845709827?s=20"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; many of the employees moved to Wisconsin for the job, without receiving assistance from Activision Blizzard. O’Brien also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eyyohbee/status/1466890788235878409?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the company had been promising team members they would get raises after Activision (Raven’s owner) completed a pay restructure, and that may be coming true in a cruel way: &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-qa-testers-face-layoffs-after-reportedly-b-1848159708"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the workers who get to stay will receive a raise from $17 an hour to $18.50 an hour, along with better benefits and bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M5O9c9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These people were asked to relocate to Madison, WI to work here. Now they are out of a job on January 28th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our QA team does incredible work but this will not only increase their workload but crush morale. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If any industry friends have open positions, please share them.&lt;/p&gt;— Austin O'Brien (@eyyohbee) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eyyohbee/status/1466891349584715778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NOzMep"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporter Jason Schreier &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466926920914903042"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that some testers he spoke to won’t know their status until next week, which likely means they’ll have to endure an uncomfortable weekend before they find out if they’ll have to spend the holidays job hunting. One QA tester for the studio &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/esheggeby/status/1466898804863651846?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that they wouldn’t know until Tuesday, and &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reported that the studio’s developers learned about the layoffs via word of mouth, instead of an official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FBO8NC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I've been in touch with about half a dozen Raven testers tonight. The company is informing them individually whether or not they're being laid off. But some don't have their meetings scheduled until next week, so they head into the weekend not knowing if they still have jobs&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1466926920914903042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Du0Fc1"&gt;Activision Blizzard has shown a pattern of laying off workers amidst booming business, as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; points out. In 2019, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222484/activision-blizzard-layoffs-cuts-jobs-record-results-2018"&gt;laid off around 8 percent of its employees&lt;/a&gt; after CEO Bobby Kotick announced that its 2018 financial results were the best in the company’s history. In June, Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-bobby-activision-ceo-kotick-pockets-a-cool-dollar155-million/"&gt;reportedly received $155 million dollars&lt;/a&gt; after a shareholder vote — a few months before that, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334569/activision-blizzard-layoffs-esports-overwatch-call-of-duty-league-covid-pandemic"&gt;laid off around 50 employees that managed events&lt;/a&gt;, giving them three month’s severance and $200 Battle.net gift cards. &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-14-call-of-duty-launch-sales-down-40-percent-year-on-year-uk-charts"&gt;Gamesindustry.biz reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;, a game made by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision, was the second largest game launch in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSercY"&gt;Activision Blizzard has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;recently been in the spotlight&lt;/a&gt; for having terrible work conditions and for not acting on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;repeated claims of abuse and sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; from employees. There are also allegations that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;Kotick knew about the issues for years and had his own history of harassment&lt;/a&gt;. In less than a week, the company is set to release an expansion to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; that ties into &lt;em&gt;Vanguard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLmwPw"&gt;Activision didn’t respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s the last Bandcamp Friday of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The BandCamp application seen displayed on a Apple MacBook..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ym5M2TutxakqsOFGE2eGW5NGETA=/974x0:5000x2684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226755/962083828.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Guillaume Payen/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IhuPzR"&gt;In March 2020, &lt;a href="https://bandcamp.com/"&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188143/bandcamp-waives-sales-fees-artists-affected-coronavirus-pandemic'"&gt;started a promotion&lt;/a&gt; where it would forego taking a revenue share from sales artists made on its platform, providing some additional support to performers with suddenly limited opportunities due to the coronavirus pandemic. The arrangement turned into a monthly event, as Bandcamp Fridays encouraged fans to keep the support coming by purchasing audio tracks and merchandise over the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cr7xs"&gt;Bandcamp pledged to keep things going throughout 2021 and has dutifully turned off its cut on the first Friday of each month. The only question left is, what happens next? The note about Bandcamp Friday sticking around for 2021 is no longer included on &lt;a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-2021"&gt;the blog post announcing the promotion&lt;/a&gt;, and no one has updated customers or creators about the plan for 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77nHlx"&gt;We have vaccines, and shows are playing again, but the pandemic isn’t quite over yet, and I know I’ve gotten used to having a day where I can tell myself it’s OK to buy an extra album or two because it’s just the right thing to do. It’s also provided some extra incentive for artists to tell their fans about Bandcamp as an alternative to streaming over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;Spotify or other music services that have fancy year-end graphics&lt;/a&gt; but don’t share as much of the money with the people who create what you’re listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fbaRO5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Music’s terrible year in review is giving me serious Spotify Wrapped FOMO ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="kkGKoB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s still Bandcamp Friday.&lt;/p&gt;— bandcamp (@Bandcamp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bandcamp/status/1466905282215391236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GofwY0"&gt;When Bandcamp Fridays launched, co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond said, “For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not.” Bandcamp says that over 800,000 fans have participated, paying over $61 million to artists and labels over the 15 days. It says that on average, 93 percent of your money reaches artists and labels when the promotion is active and, again on average, 82 percent when it isn’t, so there’s still plenty of reasons to show some appreciation with a purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7ONtN"&gt;But at least for a few more hours (until 12AM PT on December 4th), yes, it is Bandcamp Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV’s nifty new personalized profiles have been delayed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RYKC8zfgqLI1ARIyc55AGYY7h48=/66x0:782x477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226747/image004__3_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="535AB1"&gt;The individual user profiles that were expected to arrive on Google TV last month have been delayed, meaning those personalized content recommendations are unfortunately on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zpaxr"&gt;The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22716932/google-tv-profiles-watchlist-ambient-mode-philo"&gt;initially said&lt;/a&gt; the new user profiles would arrive on Google TV last month, but Google spokesperson Ivy Hunt tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today that the profiles will now begin rolling out “in the coming months.” News of the delay was &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/03/google-tv-profiles-delay/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kuAeF"&gt;That’s a bit of a bummer for multi-user households who were looking forward to profile features like customized watchlists, personalized help from Google Assistant, and weeding out the content interests of others using the same device (e.g., roommates, kids, etc. — although Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318824/google-tv-kid-profiles-announced-features-parental-controls"&gt;previously introduced&lt;/a&gt; kids’ profiles earlier this year). Having to share a single experience among multiple users is a bit like handing over your Netflix algorithm. Not ideal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfMS4L"&gt;Google didn’t offer a reason for the delay, but with any mercy, its TV experience will bring us personalized user profiles early into the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos’ Locked Folder is now rolling out to more Android phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s Locked Folder setup screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfLRJujRC6JiRMAJe0rQbFWPFaQ=/0x179:1018x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226514/Screenshot_20211203_124429.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lFV5d0"&gt;Google Photos’ Locked Folder feature, which promises to keep sensitive photos out of your main photo roll, is starting to roll out to non-Pixel phones, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/locked-folder-in-google-photos-is-starting-to-arrive-for-more-android-users/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689322/google-photos-locked-folder-passcode-protected-sensitive-images"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be rolling out to more Android phones “soon,” and it’s reportedly started to show up on some Samsung and OnePlus devices, &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos-locked-folder-expands-more-android-phones"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Older Pixel devices that didn’t originally get access to it are also getting it now, based on our tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TczW40"&gt;The feature lets you choose specific photos or videos and put them in a passcode or biometrics-locked folder, taking them out of your main photo feed and keeping them off the cloud. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524661/google-photos-locked-folder-private-videos-available-pixel"&gt;introduced on Google’s own phones (Pixel 3 and up) in June&lt;/a&gt;, after being announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442416/google-photos-locked-folder-private-hidden-pictures"&gt;Google’s I/O presentation in May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nHTuGB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Locked Folder lets you keep private pictures private&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIBaRj"&gt;In its presentation, Google used the example of parents hiding pictures of a newly purchased puppy from their children. A valid use case for sure, though I suspect most people will probably use it for less wholesome pictures, alleviating the “what if they swipe too many pictures back and see my butt” anxiety that can come when showing people photos from an unfiltered library. (Surely a relatable concern.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8agtG"&gt;The feature should be available to phones running Android 6 or later, and I was able to access it on my Pixel 2 running Android 11 by going to Photos &amp;gt; Library &amp;gt; Utilities. Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-online-never-done/"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; that the feature will come to the iOS version of Google Photos early next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsxzXB"&gt;If you’ve got the feature and want to use it, it’s worth noting that photos stored in the Locked Folder won’t be backed up to the cloud and will be deleted if you uninstall Google Photos or wipe your device without transferring them. You can read more on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/10694388?hl=en"&gt;Google’s Locked Folder support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite will soon let you stick just to deathmatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FZ5gdEa_5FNIMBtfyg-5Jg05Fg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226291/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;em&gt; multiplayer beta.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFDbK3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer beta has been a blast so far, but one common criticism is that you can’t pick a dedicated playlist for Slayer, the game’s deathmatch mode. Fortunately, that will be changing soon, but not until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjtvhR"&gt;343 Industries community manager John Junyszek &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1466858751722352643"&gt;tweeted Friday&lt;/a&gt; that a Social Slayer playlist is in the works, but it won’t be ready until after the holidays. Junyszek &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1466858751722352643"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; 343 is aiming to add Fiesta, Tactical Slayer (SWAT), and Free-For-All playlists “before the end of the year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WXqytH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Let's talk about Halo Infinite playlists!&lt;br&gt;We've been reading your feedback, and we're working on plans to add Fiesta, Tactical Slayer (SWAT), and Free-For-All playlists as we speak. They won't land by Dec 8, but the team is pushing to get them in before the end of year  &lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1466858751722352643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="KoNf7F"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A Social Slayer playlist (with multiple variations) is also in the works (we see this request the most), but we won't be able to get that one ready until after the holidays. We hope you can understand and enjoy the ones that make it in before the team takes a well-deserved break!&lt;/p&gt;— John Junyszek (@Unyshek) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1466858754495115264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PRLgSr"&gt;Right now, you can’t select a playlist for a single game mode. Instead, you’re randomly dropped into one of the modes that’s currently available, which include things like Slayer, Capture The Flag, and Oddball. That can be annoying if you just want to play one type of game — especially if you have a challenge that can only be completed in a specific mode — so the upcoming dedicated playlists could help alleviate some frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGJdmK"&gt;343 Industries has already made some other changes in response to feedback since the beta’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;surprise November 15th release&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, players have been unhappy with the speed of battle pass progression, which 343 has attempted to change by adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788990/halo-infinite-battle-pass-progression-xp-changes"&gt;new “Play 1 Game” challenges&lt;/a&gt; days after launch and, just this week, significantly increasing the amount of XP given for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Unyshek/status/1465550997476966400"&gt;the first six matches played in a day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFKC4q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans don’t just have multiplayer improvements to look forward to: &lt;em&gt;Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; single-player campaign will launch on December 8th. You’ll only be able to take on the campaign solo to start, though, as co-op won’t be added until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;May 2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest Doorbells will sound a little more melodious this holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Nest doorbell on a gray wood plank. It has a camera lens on the top and a circle button on the bottom. Snowflake designs around the background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ege_d4Rq4oeV3QE31jjKIcFQ9wk=/256x0:3105x1899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70226006/Screen_Shot_2021_12_03_at_12.38.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snowflakes and doorbells, the perfect duo | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RQUYzn"&gt;Google announced this Wednesday on its Nest &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Reconnect-this-Holiday-with-a-little-help-from-your-Nest-devices/ba-p/54509"&gt;community blog&lt;/a&gt; the return of holiday-themed ringtones for Nest Doorbells (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/02/nest-doorbell-holiday-ringtone-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Visitors arriving for family holiday gatherings can now press the Nest Doorbell and be greeted with sounds of the holidays, including “Winter,” Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas, and New Year’s jingles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pydqGJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Time to give your &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NestDoorbell?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NestDoorbell&lt;/a&gt; ringtone some holiday cheer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choose from:&lt;br&gt;  Hanukkah&lt;br&gt;  Christmas&lt;br&gt;  Kwanzaa&lt;br&gt;...and more!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turn on holiday ringtones for the Nest Doorbell (battery) in the Google Home app, or for the Nest Doorbell (wired) in the Nest app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/dyumPbyl5s"&gt;https://t.co/dyumPbyl5s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yziGRTKrQA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yziGRTKrQA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Made By Google (@madebygoogle) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1466154051100413960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VoLMuA"&gt;Google did have holiday bell options last year as well — but only as a perk for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255962/google-nest-aware-subscription-model-change-single-fee-all-devices-event-recording"&gt;subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to its Nest Aware smart alert service. This year, owners of both the battery Nest Doorbell and the wired version (formerly Nest Hello) can get in on the fun sans that subscription. Google mentions that the newer battery Nest Doorbell requires users to use the Google Home app with an account in order to activate the themes — while wired users can also enable them through the Nest app and site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT7Uz3"&gt;Google is setting the trend on having seasonal ringtones — in October of this year, the company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699288/google-nest-doorbell-spooky-halloween-holiday-ringtones"&gt;Halloween-themed&lt;/a&gt; ringtones with multiple spooky tunes. The ghostly ringtones also replicated onto accompanied Nest speakers and hubs inside the home — a feature now available for the new holiday ringtones so families and friends can get cheery together before even opening the door.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iPhone app screenshot: List of themes for the google nest doorbells including Hanukkah, Christmas, kwanzaa, " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGI8mdiriOIAuFfKOMYX7Bmqq_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061120/Google_doorbells.001.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tn5TML"&gt;Google plans to run the new holiday ringtones from December 1st through and after New Year’s on January 5th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned you can surf YouTube on old Chromecasts with a hidden phone remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_z5iz2MVB7F30OanoCvntH1FHKk=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70225907/PXL_20211203_200442272.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O8oknN"&gt;Did you know the YouTube app on your older Chromecast has a hidden remote control that lets you surface an entire YouTube app that you can scroll?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I824Fk"&gt;You just need to start casting something to your TV in the YouTube app with the Cast button up top — then hit the Cast button a second time to access a menu where you’ll find a button labeled Remote. Then, you get a full D-pad to move around, a voice search button, and the all-important Back button you’ll need to back out of that video and access a full YouTube interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJiZDP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Watching YouTube on your TV with Google Chromecast? You can use your phone as a remote to cast and control the YouTube app on your TV. Here's how: &lt;a href="https://t.co/LdVa3Peyw3"&gt;https://t.co/LdVa3Peyw3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nAaYUKx0Sy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nAaYUKx0Sy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1466572963507957760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dzSm8F"&gt;Originally, the Google Chromecast HDMI dongle required you to control it largely from your phone, “casting” each and every video you wanted to watch to your TV screen instead of browsing — until the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;2020 Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/a&gt; added its own physical remote.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6Obq5"&gt;But apparently, that changed. &lt;a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/youtube-chromecast-remote-hidden-ui-google-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; reported in February&lt;/a&gt; that the YouTube app on Chromecast had added a browsing experience with the hidden remote, and sites &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/03/youtube-app-chromecast-ultra/"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-brings-the-full-youtube-app-experience-to-your-older-chromecast/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are now reporting that it’s broadly rolling out to older dongles like the third-gen Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra. That’s a nice bonus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free"&gt;if you recently nabbed the Ultra for $22.22&lt;/a&gt; in the Stadia sale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOXk9a2pITMYhEwCY8KjeqSPIJ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23061469/PXL_20211203_200908381.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0j1mdo"&gt;I can’t confirm when it rolled out, but I do see that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7640706"&gt;Google’s support page has officially added instructions for using the remote&lt;/a&gt;, something that the Wayback Machine tells me wasn’t yet there back on, say, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211005012925/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7640706"&gt;October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, and the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1466572963507957760"&gt;tweeted about the feature&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH8Va3"&gt;The phone remote is a little laggy compared to using a dedicated remote or even using an iPhone to control an Apple TV, but it works fine so far on my Chromecast Ultra. I’d probably use it a lot if I valued YouTube’s recommendations more. (I don’t understand why it keeps recommending videos I’ve already watched and ones from many years ago.) I wish it were available in Netflix, where I do tend to scroll a lot, but I didn’t see the option there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU4e5X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best gaming laptop in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 gaming laptop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best gaming laptop is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="23pZwg"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top contenders now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as the best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yzdsDK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQQiQ0"&gt;This year’s model comes with an FHD 360Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop. It also has a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color without being too intense for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition is powered by an impressive AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best AMD gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is a great gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OCz9wT"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OanWnj"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful 14-inch device that can keep up with the best 15-inch gaming laptops on the market, the only place you’ll find that is the Razer Blade 14. This slim and portable device includes Nvdia’s RTX 3070 and RTX 3080, Nvidia’s top-of-the-line mobile GPUs, as well as a powerful eight-core AMD chip. It’s a gorgeous device, with a QHD 165Hz display option and a classy RGB keyboard. There’s even a reasonable port selection, including HDMI 2.1 as well as two USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alienware X17 is a powerful but surprisingly thin and quiet gaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J74U3a"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765258/alienware-x17-review-4k-17-inch-gaming-laptop"&gt;Alienware X17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lzKwju"&gt;A gaming laptop with a 4K screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m6FWbU"&gt;There’s finally a laptop that can deliver an enjoyable gaming experience in 4K — as long as you’re prepared to fork over some real cash. The Alienware X17 (currently starting at $2,199) can run all kinds of modern titles at playable frame rates at its native 3840 x 2160 resolution. It could even stay close to 60fps with ray tracing on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULSQ9m"&gt;The X17’s power isn’t its only standout quality. Dell has also managed to cram that power into an impressively thin and sleek chassis. It’s just 0.84 inches thick, with an RGB keyboard that isn’t too obnoxious and a touchpad that lights up when you press it. And it’s quite cool and quiet, even under heavy gaming loads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpAXv8"&gt;On the other hand, the X17 would not be a good choice to double as a daily driver (though it did do well in our Premiere Pro testing). The webcam is mediocre, and the touchpad is a bit small, especially for a 17-inch notebook. Battery life only averaged around four hours in our testing. And while the chassis is compact, it’s still not light, weighing in at over six pounds. But if you’re looking for a 4K laptop that is, first and foremost, great at running games, this device should top your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and comes with a 240Hz QHD display, but at just 4.39 pounds and 0.62 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a portable, powerful gaming device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;A gaming laptop with an exceptional keyboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is no longer the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s still great. For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent, and the keyboard is one of the absolute best you can buy on the market. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, though the Razer Blade 14 delivers better raw performance, we still have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eM7Jm"&gt;Asus recently collaborated with DJ Alan Walker on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;Zephyrus G14 Alan Walker Edition&lt;/a&gt;, with a box that becomes  DJ deck. &lt;/p&gt;
