    <title>Amazon Echo devices are still selling at Black Friday prices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oFVofi"&gt;Many Alexa-powered Amazon Echo speakers and displays are still enjoying Black Friday discounts. One of the most appealing deals is on the Amazon Echo Show 5 display, which is normally $84.99 but can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J8FFJ8H?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=46f7e73c17de7f7932a352dfa95507a6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vIoa0cLs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $44.99. This smart display could be the perfect companion for your nightstand or kitchen counter, since it can handle alarm, recipe, and entertainment duties. While it shares a lot of functionality with Echo speakers, the Echo Show display is capable of more, like streaming video from Prime Video and Netflix, showing you the forecast, or displaying your agenda for the day. Additionally, the built-in camera lets you video chat with family and friends. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bypsgZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c66tlk"&gt;You can also find the latest version (you can tell by its spherical design) of the Amazon Echo with upgraded speakers for just $59.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF75B8?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c7211d3d6f00f76ea7b1b78a30f21d02&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgik84pPe5z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $40 discount off the regular price. While this model only offers iterative upgrades over its predecessor, Dan Seifert, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;who reviewed this latest model Echo&lt;/a&gt;, praised the sound quality and attentive mics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDhnS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873864"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oZB0tW"&gt;The WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds from Sony are currently discounted to $129.99, their lowest price yet at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. At launch, these earbuds retailed for $228.99. While XM3 may not share the same features as the newer XM4, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review by Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt; proves that there are several reasons to invest in a pair, including excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, as well as lengthy battery life. Consider whether its large case aligns with your taste, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bjioox"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9mNbxu"&gt;Samsung’s 8.7-inch Galaxy Tab A7 Lite Android tablet is currently available at its lowest price at Best Buy. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgio9klSpgA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The base model with 32GB of storage has been reduced to $120&lt;/a&gt;, taking $40 off the regular price. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgaH7AMoAsX?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The model that doubles the storage to 64GB is $70 off, available for just $10 more at $130&lt;/a&gt;. This discount applies to both the dark gray and silver colorways, in case you were wondering. It’s also worth noting that Best Buy is offering 20 percent off on a qualifying accessory when purchased with the tablet, netting you additional savings on things like screen protectors and cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uU7fcF"&gt;Both tablets feature a 1340 x 800 resolution display and boast the Android 11 OS. And while the camera quality and performance aren’t going to win any awards, the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite seems like a step up in overall build quality and features offered versus other budget-friendly tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8YPoxb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869140"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb9vUp"&gt;Corsair has discounted a pair of its flagship keyboards, the K100 and K95 RGB Platinum XT, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR68MQZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiljRYN0ZK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Corsair’s K100 is currently discounted to $189.99 at Amazon and the official Corsair website, taking $40 off the regular MSRP. This full-sized keyboard bears a striking similarity to the Corsair K95 but also includes a multi-function scroll wheel that can be used to quickly switch applications or zoom in and out of windows. Just note that this discount is only available for the version equipped with the Cherry MX Speed key switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7zkUd8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9735675"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cMsBud"&gt;The previous flagship keyboard for Corsair, the K95 RGB Platinum XT, upgraded the original K95 with PBT keycaps and integration with the Elgato Stream Deck hardware. Normally $200, the model with Cherry MX Speed switches has been discounted to $149.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Platinum-Mechanical-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B082GR814B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9qRDjiluJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. There are other models available with Cherry Blue and Brown switches available, but those currently don’t share the same discount. The K95 has many of the bells and whistles you’d want in a full-size keyboard, including dedicated media playback and macro keys, in addition to per-key RGB lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7d8G4T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQzbFA"&gt;Logitech is branching out with its gaming accessories by offering its peripherals in a wide variety of outrageous color combinations. Currently, the Logitech G435 headset is available in three colorways at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-G435-LIGHTSPEED-Bluetooth-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Lightweight-over-ear-headphones-built-in-mics-18h-battery-compatible-Dolby-Atmos-PC-PS4-PS/377935551&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealRoundup120921&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf0Ap1jmugG?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fauthors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G435-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B08R8DT7X6?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=20&amp;amp;imprToken=38befe54-c7c1-45ab-2e1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22590360%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $59.99, taking $20 off the regular price. To sweeten the deal, if you purchase this headset from Amazon, you’ll also get a free in-game weapon skin for &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ex6ge9"&gt;While you can always go with black, this universally compatible headset also comes in white with light blue accents, as well as a vivid pink and blue combo. The G435 can last up to 18 hours between charging and can pair with devices either through Bluetooth or with the included 2.4GHz wireless dongle. This model is currently our top pick if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6idgyH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10866389"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lXePzG"&gt;Lastly, we have a friendly public service announcement to take advantage of the Steam Winter Sale through January 5th. While there are plenty of titles that are, in fact, cheaper on the Epic Games Store thanks to the additional $10 coupon granted to all current users, there are a handful of Steam-exclusive games that are worth checking out. For example, the entire library of expansions for the &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Planet Zoo&lt;/em&gt; are on sale. Some other exclusives to Steam include &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; for $53.99, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for $29.99, and &lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt; for just $4.79. If you’re deliberating on what games are worth your time this year, make sure to check out our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22803171/gaming-pc-computer-best-games-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best games for your new gaming PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego’s official Sonic the Hedgehog set recreates picture-perfect Green Hill Zone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKzmSy0OdduhDYAk0z1HJlYVZY0=/1726x1793:5301x4176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70323019/21331_Lifestyle__015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaMnDn"&gt;After months of waiting, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22264366/lego-sonic-mania-set-green-hill-zone-ideas"&gt;Lego’s official Sonic the Hedgehog set&lt;/a&gt; is finally here: a $69.99, 1,125-piece recreation of the iconic Green Hill Zone stage, complete with Lego-ized versions of the titular heroic hedgehog, a handful of classic Sonic villains, Dr. Eggman, and — of course — the Chaos Emeralds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0kl33"&gt;Officially called the Lego Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;set, the new kit’s origins are in a crowdsourced Lego Ideas set that was suggested by Lego and Sonic fan Viv Grannell in early 2019. After the set reached 10,000 votes through the Ideas program, Lego conducted an official review of the project in March 2020, and in February 2021, greenlit the proposal for development into a real set. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-VMSLnXPw0RlZlolksYnsb0n77A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128527/21331_Lifestyle__002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You mean the Chaos Emeralds?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gOniJD"&gt;And the final set looks great: the bright, blocky 8-bit design of the original set translates &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well to the similar brick-based Lego design, and the details of the set (which include a checkpoint marker, a Technic-powered spring to launch Sonic, power-up crates, and a picture-perfect loop) all feel ripped right out of the Genesis original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ixv2Af"&gt;The final set is taking a bit of a different direction from Grannell’s original proposed Idea set, which was more explicitly focused on &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with Lego versions of that game’s villainous Hard Boiled Heavies, Egg Robot mech, and the Phantom Ruby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UwnbTF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10949849"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h2YZWy"&gt;The retail set, however, takes a less title-specific approach to recreating Green Hill Zone in Lego form, with the stage’s Crabmeat and Moto Bug enemies and Dr. Eggman boss (all three of which are constructed out of bricks, instead of the more traditional minifigure design), along with Eggman’s Egg Mobile ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRkcEX"&gt;The new Sonic set isn’t technically the first time that Sonic has appeared in Lego form. The character was part of a &lt;a href="https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Level_Pack_(Lego_Dimensions)"&gt;Lego Dimensions tie-in set in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, although the new minifigure version of Sonic has an updated design with additional details (like Sonic’s sneaker buckles printed on the minifigure’s feet). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fU9gDkDIjlTbSKBm_DDkCfoZF2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128514/21331_Lifestyle__008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple sets can be linked together thanks to its modular nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9lSGic"&gt;It’s important to note that, unlike Lego’s other major recent video game partnership with Nintendo on its &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; sets, the Sonic sets aren’t intended as an interactive play set. Sonic’s Lego debut is a purely brick-based creation, with no smart sensors or companion apps. That said, the set is intended to be somewhat modular, allowing fans to buy multiple copies (or perhaps one day, additional Sonic-themed sets) to extend the level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXss6W"&gt;The Lego Ideas Sonic the Hedgehog Green Hill Zone&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;set will be available both in person at Lego stores and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flego.com%2FSonic&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F28%2F22855708%2Flego-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone-set-sega-toy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Lego’s website&lt;/a&gt; for $69.99 starting on New Year’s Day. But if you’re looking to snag a copy, you might want to take a cue from Sonic himself and go... fast. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our predictions for the next year in audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FL8xg0wKPIizcdIxNXlt5a9Q20M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70322958/acastro_211217_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rq4iTP"&gt;Hello, hello. I hope you all had a nice holiday and are ready for another one. Last week we looked back on 2021, and this week, we’re looking forward to 2022. We have a couple quick news hits from last week to get through first, but then Aria and I will offer our predictions for the year to come. Off we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qrbrX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Brazen and Audiation ordered to release audio recorded for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat Leonard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lG9TRU"&gt;In a troubling precedent for journalism, a judge in San Diego ruled the podcast companies behind&lt;em&gt; Fat Leonard&lt;/em&gt;, Project Brazen and Audiation, must share all recorded audio from their lead character, Leonard Glenn Francis — even audio that wasn’t included in the show’s final cut. The &lt;em&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2021-12-22/fat-leonard-podcaster-recordings"&gt;has all the details&lt;/a&gt;, but essentially, the podcast tells the story of fraud and bribery within the US Navy. Six naval officers are currently accused of criminal bribery and are heading to trial in February. One of the officers’ legal team subpoenaed for the audio recordings, which they say might hold critical information for the defense, given that Francis is a key witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K55kxd"&gt;Per the paper, the judge said the “naval officers’ Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and confrontation ‘are paramount’ and overshadow the podcast producers’ First Amendment rights to protect their sources and unpublished materials.” Instead of quietly submitting the audio to the lawyers, the companies &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nm7410pbdup7xcb/AACPYux3PjECh289CdLuQ2fSa?dl=0"&gt;instead released&lt;/a&gt; all 20 hours’ worth publicly on Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ass413"&gt;“We disagree with this ruling and believe it sets a bad precedent for media freedom in the US,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwrightasia/status/1473864623866748931?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Project Brazen co-founder Tom Wright. We here at &lt;em&gt;Hot Pod&lt;/em&gt; agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3dLDL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter Spaces reaches 2 million users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMHhw0"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/technology/clubhouse-twitter-spaces.html"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; about the ongoing war between Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces. Both are competing for show hosts and users, who have switched between the two platforms. The story also includes a couple number nuggets that are worth calling out: Spaces reached 2 million users in “recent months,” while Clubhouse says the app was downloaded 1.8 million times in November alone. The two apps are fighting and growing: that’s how we’re ending the year, and I’m sure it’s how we’ll continue to talk about the apps in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLfnqL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automattic’s CEO wants to keep podcasting open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMtz18"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/matt-mullenweg"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a great profile last week of Matt Mullenweg, CEO of Automattic, the company behind WordPress and Tumblr, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580023/automattic-pocket-casts-podcast-app-tumble-wordpress"&gt;acquirer of&lt;/a&gt; Pocket Casts. The story mostly focuses on Mullenweg’s personal journey to this point and the ethos that drives him. For us, that also means the chance to piece together his vision for podcasting’s future, too, and how Pocket Casts fits into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGr8YH"&gt;“There is one thing that binds the many products under the Automattic umbrella together: a bet on and belief in the open web and open-source software,” writes David Pierce. “Most people will tell you it feels like the future of tech hangs in the balance. But the way Mullenweg sees it, open is still going to win. It’s not a matter of if, only when. And all he’s trying to do is help make it happen a little faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kqggkh"&gt;A win for all the folks rallying against the closed platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdvNlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened to Dan Bongino’s threat to quit his radio show over a vaccine mandate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzSmNY"&gt;We wrote here about podcaster and radio host Dan Bongino threatening to quit his show over Cumulus Media’s vaccine mandate. That was months ago, however, and Bongino is still on the air. What happened? &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/12/20/bongino-ultimatum/"&gt;pointed&lt;/a&gt; at the obvious thing — the lack of Bongino actually doing anything — and provided an update. People in the story call the whole thing a “stunt” while Bongino says he’s in an “ongoing fight” with the company and hasn’t quit because he needs to protect his staff’s jobs. Who’s surprised? (If you want even more Bongino content, &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/dan-bongino-and-the-big-business-of-returning-trump-to-power"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a profile of him yesterday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="VgSxYQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rRkQTM"&gt;And now…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciITe5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the prediction party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saXQ6H"&gt;Let’s get to the predictions. Both Aria and I wrote up what we expect to see and cover next year. We’re ready to be held accountable for these guesses, and I know we can count on you all to do so! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idobax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook will start hosting and monetizing podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojUsuN"&gt;Facebook got into podcasts this past year by allowing hosts to distribute their RSS feeds on Pages, and next year, I believe the company will start hosting and monetizing shows — no RSS feed required. Of course, saying this will happen in 2022 requires Facebook prioritizing and building the functionality, and it’s unclear how invested it is in actually doing it. But I do believe hosting and monetization is Facebook’s ultimate goal in the space, so I anticipate seeing it happen at some point.  -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHhPjv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More headline-making podcast appearances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiP61i"&gt;While podcasts are increasingly a stop on celebrities’ press circuits, they remain the intimate medium they’ve always been: guards are lowered and conversations get real. Given this intersection, we’re likely to hear more and more high-profile people saying some pretty jarring things on tape. As a reminder, the next host of &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-fired-1235045394/"&gt;was ultimately fired&lt;/a&gt; from his role because of &lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2021/8/18/22631299/mike-richards-jeopardy-host-search-process-past-comments"&gt;horrendous things&lt;/a&gt; he’d said on a podcast years before, ostensibly emboldened by the casual setting. Just months after he was let go, another person who’d once had the stamp of approval from the educational TV show — football player Aaron Rodgers — &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BGBwqKka6JOWawexPm35V?si=EPJwPQzlT7uwTzM-zcP1YA&amp;amp;context=spotify%3Ashow%3A1ol0jP8hrNHydiAd38G6B1&amp;amp;t=1098"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; his squeaky-clean public persona for praise of ivermectin, all over the course of 45 minutes on the podcast &lt;em&gt;The Pat McAfee Show 2.0&lt;/em&gt;. We’re in for quite a ride as even more people try out the medium. -AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aBM3e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be fewer exclusive show deals and more windowing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJAdrQ"&gt;Spotify popularized the idea of shows going exclusive to one platform, but looking ahead, I foresee this trend fading out. If ad revenue is the primary goal for most of the big platforms, minimizing shows’ audiences by housing them in one place doesn’t make much sense. Instead, I expect to see more deals like the one between Amazon Music and &lt;em&gt;SmartLess&lt;/em&gt; with one week of exclusivity, or Amazon Music and &lt;em&gt;9/12&lt;/em&gt;, which offered the entire, bingeable show on the app with only one episode per week released elsewhere. Now, a two-for-one prediction: I also expect &lt;strong&gt;more Spotify-exclusive deals will not re-sign&lt;/strong&gt;. The big paycheck is nice, but it likely comes at the expense of reach and influence. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS1bsw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salaries become standardized (through solidarity)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5vndl"&gt;When hiring for one-off audio positions, people continue to reference the &lt;a href="https://airmedia.org/tools/all-our-rate-guides"&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://airmedia.org/tools/guide-to-fair-practice"&gt;best practices&lt;/a&gt; made publicly available by the organization AIR, and I have a feeling folks will soon realize they want (read: need) standards for staff positions, too — especially as more of those positions are created. There aren’t many places to turn to for that information, though. &lt;a href="https://airmedia.org/tools/salaries"&gt;I predict current salaried workers will soon act on that, and that at least part of it will be bold, public, and online, even if &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meuceph/status/1412224182687911940?s=21"&gt;demystifying money&lt;/a&gt; by just talking about it has mostly been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimHerrera/status/1456441667456839704"&gt;the domain of freelancers&lt;/a&gt;.  -AB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7jb5c1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BhKbA8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more built-out Spotify Wrapped for podcasts &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDz7c5"&gt;Still only two slides dedicated to podcasts? I’ve gotta say, I expected more from a company that spent this whole year trying to prove it did more than music. -AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt0hBO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcasts become a way to sell products, especially by influencers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PewEe6"&gt;You can already argue that podcasts are an important sales channel because of promo codes and direct response advertisers, but I imagine we might see affiliate revenue play a bigger role in 2022. Influencers could still launch shows with the primary intention of using them as a way to connect with fans, but increasingly, they may just want to sell more stuff. It could be their own product line or an affiliate partnership with a larger company. I suspect this is why Amazon is taking an interest in the space — podcasts move product, and Amazon has a lot of product to move. Plus, it runs a huge affiliate revenue business. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eDV7n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More pro gamers launch podcasts and reach huge numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zq7XQ"&gt;We talk a lot about Hollywood stars entering podcasting, but next year, I anticipate writing more about pro gamers hosting shows. We’re already seeing hints of this. QCODE’s Wood Elf Media produces &lt;em&gt;Distractible&lt;/em&gt; from streamer Mark Fischbach (aka Markiplier), which &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/markiplier-podcast-distractible-top-charts-1234978606/"&gt;apparently topped&lt;/a&gt; Joe Rogan on Spotify’s own charts. Gamers come with a built-in audience and, more so than influencers, are used to talking and having things to say, priming them for podcast fame. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zILLIv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luminary gets bought or shuts down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMXIce"&gt;I had to make some kind of Luminary prediction, and I’m guessing the company either gets bought or shuts down. That’s it. Maybe it’ll thrive on its own, but it’s now entering its third year of existence, and something has to happen. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ7dvl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live social audio goes on-demand and becomes a hot zone for moderation discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMJ90n"&gt;If 2021 was the year every platform built or invested in live audio, I believe 2022 will be the year they instead focus on on-demand content. Both Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, as well as Spotify’s forgotten Greenroom, allow conversations to be recorded, and these replays will become essential to growing and maintaining the user bases. At the same time, I predict live audio’s reputation will tarnish as conversations run amok with misinformation, racism, threats of violence, and whatever else the internet is good at drumming up. -AC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4WWTjk"&gt;
&lt;p id="RmMxYx"&gt;Thanks for sticking with us this year. Pop some bottles and manifest those dreams for 2022. We’ll be back Thursday for our insiders with a special Aria edition, and for the rest of y’all, we’re here Tuesday with our usually scheduled programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>9 great games for your new Android phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jxfLUo5HIGBGT1gqFLbE5TUq1E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70322993/RoundUpArt_AndroidGames.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Load your phone with these recommendations, many of which are free&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pcHiQ5"&gt;In addition to being a popular mobile OS, Android is one of the most bustling gaming platforms on Earth. If you have a recent Android phone or tablet, or even one that’s a couple of years old, you should be able to run a majority of the games available in the Google Play Store. That’s good because there are some stellar, console-quality games that you should be aware of, if you aren’t already in the know. Whether you just got a new Android phone, or you just want a few recommendations to use with your current phone, we’ve got you covered with the list below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oRyxcz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Among Us" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYA66oCN98NuFOFw8v3VISXwGwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789706/amongus.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5JP0bC"&gt;There’s a chance you’ve heard of &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; even if you aren’t that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tapped into gaming. It’s an online co-operative and competitive game where you work together with a team of space cadets, maintaining a space station — except one of you is an imposter whose goal it is to deceive everyone and eventually take over. As the imposter, it’s your job to be as sly and unassuming as possible, while everyone else is on edge that any of the others might be a back-stabber. It’s a simple game with a tense edge. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9rbAM5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Among Us gives crewmates their own powers just in time for Thanksgiving murder sessions","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772634/among-us-update-roles-scientist-engineer-angle-shapeshifter-town-of-us"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="rMOhjq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10920043" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7kWCpI"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pzHvjc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Call of Duty: Mobile" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8dGZH3IOufjxoogm2rXbBNrNJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22420440/Screen_Shot_2021_04_04_at_2.11.26_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gaTSsL"&gt;If you’ve always wanted to experience something that’s similar to playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; on a console, definitely check out &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt;. In a sense, it’s a simpler version of the console experience since, by default (though it can be changed), guns automatically shoot when you hover over an enemy. Yet it’s visually impressive for a mobile port, and it offers several guns and other customizable traits that should satisfy that itch for a mobile first-person shooter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ndZM43"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Call of Duty is the biggest mobile game launch ever, with 100 million downloads","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="E8rH1K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10920058" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="RvdbxG"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OUjuXd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pokémon Unite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SeyynzjK5aKDEIjKpAsQ1njK8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735503/Pokemon_UNITE___Team_Up._Take_Down.___Hero_Image___1080p.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5FOVuE"&gt;If you enjoy MOBA genre games on your PC, like &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; could scratch that itch while you’re on the go. While not as technically deep as either of those aforementioned games, &lt;em&gt;Unite&lt;/em&gt; delivers on the core fundamentals of the competitive genre, and of course it’s deeply entrenched in the world of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;. This game’s free, and it offers cross-play and cross-progression with the Nintendo Switch version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LJvZna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Pokémon Unite turns monster battles into a team sport ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590249/pokemon-unite-nintendo-switch-hands-on-esports"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="0K4KiQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10920089" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EpztRj"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EDmFMQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fortnite" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyTAyt3aLAnXU513hWUg9fpK3Hg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23062815/19BR_KeyArt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T2299H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;remains one of the most popular free games available on Android, even though it’s not so straightforward to install for a lot of people. If you want to download this battle royale game that pits you against up to 100 others in a huge, ever-changing map, non-Samsung users will need to head to &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/mobile/android/get-started"&gt;Epic Games’ site on your phone&lt;/a&gt;, then find the link to install its app, from which you can install &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. If you do have a Samsung phone, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is available exclusively within its &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgfOXqnUeqr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Store&lt;/a&gt;. All other phones from other brands will need to take the long route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nF9saf"&gt;For more explicit instructions, check out our article on how to install &lt;em&gt;Fornite&lt;/em&gt; on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f5UMet"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install Fortnite on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22736420/fortnite-android-google-install-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VfqI49"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10920194" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2w4p2D"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PpNuRG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dead Cells" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZLe1s-C9XQAwTZbEZs1fOy3pX90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19881887/256b98bb_9570173.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Motion Twin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="raZnLO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; is yet another console-quality port made for Android phones. For those unfamiliar with the game, this is one of the better side-scrolling action games available today and is fun to play for hours on end. Developers are still supporting it with new content years after its original launch on PC. You start each run with a random set of weapons, and the levels are procedurally generated, meaning the items contained within levels (along with their layouts) are never exactly the same every time. So, despite the somewhat high difficulty curve, the more you play, the better the items you’ll get, which will help make the game a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="GoIfR3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dead Cells is the best Castlevania game in years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/6/17655322/dead-cells-review-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-castlevania"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Fwrhxs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10920103" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="My3WWG"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fLJVVd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Genshin Impact" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HgaytI-m3WxurM1zsl2oGFkjsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21991906/50272117098_4902e671b7_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: miHoYo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kxv0mZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; is a global phenomenon, combining the aesthetic of anime and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; with the gameplay of an MMO. It’s free to play (with paid cosmetics available), but if you want a game that offers up gorgeous visuals and rich, varied gameplay, check this one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eraRie"&gt;Impressively, this game supports cross-save progression if you have a miHoYo account. So, you can pick up on Android right where you left off on PC or console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7ZlNyT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10921265" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="CxhJ3n"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aq05p9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pikmin Bloom" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpcGuojuSmXobopzvOjo6ttXQP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957144/Key_art_with_English_logo.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VpChuR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is one of Nintendo and Niantic’s latest mobile experiments. In this one, you grow little pikmin creatures from seeds as you walk. The game taps into your phone’s GPS location, and it’s designed to get you outside and moving around. While it’s less of a game than many of the entries on this list, with few objectives other than taking a certain amount of steps to develop seeds into pikmin, it can be a relaxing thing to play (especially if you’ve enjoyed previous &lt;em&gt;Pikmin &lt;/em&gt;games from Nintendo consoles). If anything, it makes the act of walking around a little more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XUTTsk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Pikmin Bloom is a cute app that tries to make walking a little more magical ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746461/pikmin-bloom-hands-on-niantic-iphone-android"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="UlmYbF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10921782" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="p1VKHq"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KLnN6t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="xXoqt1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g3r1KbzSiT8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ApFq0M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky: Children of the Light&lt;/em&gt; is the latest game from Thatgamecompany, responsible for relaxing games including &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Flower&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;em&gt;Sky &lt;/em&gt;is similarly gorgeous and mysterious, and it’s a must-play if you enjoy playing a game that lets you take in the visuals instead of constantly demanding twitchy reflexes to win. The character movement and flight controls feel good to use, and there’s more than enough collectibles and engaging story to warrant a free download.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lvx04q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; is an instant recommendation if you’ve played games like &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. It borrows elements from all of those games, like interpersonal relationships, growing crops, building out your dream home, but it adds plenty of its own gameplay mechanics in the mix. You can choose to live your days making sure to buy the perfect birthday present for your best friends, fish to your heart’s content, or dive into the mines to gather rare minerals (fighting some spooky baddies along the way). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 patients only need to isolate for five days as long as symptoms are gone, CDC says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Health care workers prepare to test a man for COVID-19 at a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYv4uhtwjXahjkue4BuNHdWUtaA=/23x0:2977x1969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321541/1237390695.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A4UjtV"&gt;People who test positive for COVID-19 only need to isolate for five days as long as their symptoms have stopped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The change to isolation guidelines from 10 days to five is based on data showing people with COVID-19 are most likely to be contagious to others during the few days before and after they start showing symptoms, the agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uXGCT"&gt;After leaving isolation, people should wear a mask around others for five additional days, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFGU6U"&gt;The CDC also said Monday that people who haven’t received a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine but received their second dose of an mRNA vaccine six months ago, or who received a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine two months ago, should quarantine for five days if they’re exposed to someone with COVID-19. That’s a change from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276905/covid-vaccine-quarantine-symptoms-test"&gt;previous guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which said people who are fully vaccinated don’t need to quarantine if they have exposure to someone sick with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq0ZhD"&gt;The changes to isolation guidelines for people sick with COVID-19 come only a few days after the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/health/cdc-covid-isolation-period-health-care-workers.html"&gt;said that health care workers&lt;/a&gt; only need to isolate for seven days if they test positive for the virus, as long as they’re asymptomatic and have a negative test on the seventh day. The United Kingdom also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/22/uk-shortens-covid-19-isolation-period-to-7-days-in-england.html"&gt;shortened its recommended isolation period&lt;/a&gt; to seven days, as long as people have negative tests on the sixth and seventh days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojefw6"&gt;Today’s new guidelines from the CDC for the general public in the United States do not include a recommendation to take a test at the end of the five-day isolation period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93NhBj"&gt;The highly contagious omicron variant is driving unprecedented surges in COVID-19 cases, and in many places, more people are testing positive for the virus each day than ever before. As a result, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/business/workers-covid-isolate.html"&gt;faced pressure&lt;/a&gt; from various industries, including airlines, to shorten the isolation period in order to reduce staffing shortages from people testing positive and missing ten days of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwWITX"&gt;Public health experts say a shorter isolation period is supported by research on the virus. However, people should be truly recovered if they’re going to return to everyday activities. “What I don’t want to see happen is for this to be used as an excuse to force people to come back while they are unwell,” Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and an associate dean at the School of Public Health at Brown University, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/business/workers-covid-isolate.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Stores across NYC are only open if you’re picking up an online order</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bax011"&gt;As initially reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1475577591268446214"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-27/apple-closes-new-york-city-stores-to-shoppers-after-covid-spike"&gt;all of New York City’s Apple Stores&lt;/a&gt; have joined the list of locations closing their doors to most customers amid a spike in the number of COVID-19 infections. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ5AT4"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850946/apple-store-covid-two-hour-free-shipping-option"&gt;Apple closed seven stores in North America&lt;/a&gt; in a single day as positive tests among employees rose, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/27/20-apple-stores-closed-in-us-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that even before this announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/"&gt;the Apple website listed&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 locations that were closed today due to the effects of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu30nI"&gt;For people in New York City, the stores are still accessible if you have an appointment to pick up an online order. All other services, like its Genius Bar tech support or shopping by appointment, are currently listed as unavailable. There’s no word on how long the current situation will last, but Apple is no longer offering the free two-hour delivery option it pushed ahead of last week’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Messy NFT drop angers infosec pioneers with unauthorized portraits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyZq5g-eplnmB1P3ZAMNXj7WtXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321294/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NrAAQa"&gt;An unauthorized NFT drop celebrating infosec pioneers has collapsed into a mess of conflicting takedowns and piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brOs38"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IBCDAO/status/1474725664741756931"&gt;Released on Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt; by a group called “ItsBlockchain,” the “Cipher Punks” NFT package included portraits of 46 distinct figures, with ten copies of each token. Taken at their opening price, the full value of the drop was roughly $4,000. But almost immediately, the infosec community began to raise objections — including some from the portrait subjects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="vaGhnt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O99BKc"&gt;The portrait images misspelled several names — including EFF speech activist Jillian York and OpenPGP creator Jon Callas — and based at least one drawing on a copyright-protected photograph. More controversially, the list included some figures who have been ostracized for harmful personal behavior, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16807116/infosec-community-sexual-predators-weinstein-assault"&gt;Jacob Appelbaum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnWcLz"&gt;Responding on Twitter, York tweeted a link to her own portrait and said simply, “I don’t approve of this whatsoever and would like it removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxn3gO"&gt;Removing the NFTs has been more complicated than it might seem. The ItsBlockchain team apologized on Twitter for not obtaining likeness rights in advance and said it has removed 28 NFTs from the group and burned two others. But there’s no clear procedure for removing tokens that have already been sold, and ItsBlockchain is mostly counting on the central OpenSea platform to remove the tokens and resolve the issue. ItsBlockchain has appealed to the platform for guidance, but so far it has received little guidance. (OpenSea did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9NavJ"&gt;“We have been trying to resolve this issue ... we want to take it down,” the group said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “OpenSea involvement would make the job easy at this stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsA1TQ"&gt;The incident is a reminder of the potentially thorny legal issues around NFTs, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22809090/nft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to"&gt;norms of permissionless innovation&lt;/a&gt; often clash with likeness rights and intellectual property law. Typically, US laws around publicity rights hold that a person’s name and identity can’t be used for promotion without their consent — although it’s unclear how such a lawsuit would work in practice when applied to NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Batman’s latest trailer introduces the Riddler as a FaceTime troll</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vc3BlHrId9W7dr04djpfzd66B40=/0x16:1300x883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321283/enigma_coffiee.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TX7OmT"&gt;A new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; gives us a glimpse at Catwoman’s “thing” for stray cats and the Riddler’s affinity for FaceTime. What’s promised as an even grittier take on &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; stars Robert Pattinson as Batman, Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, and Paul Dano as the Riddler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5RaTA"&gt;The two-and-a-half-minute teaser, appropriately titled “The Bat and the Cat,” highlights the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, who don’t always appear to get along. In one scene, Batman is commenting on the — apparently concerning — number of cats Catwoman has in her home, and in the next, the duo is sparring in a low-lit office. The pair comes together by the end of the trailer, with both battling the same bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Kegmeni7GGP3a9pyW9Pg7qqSi8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128475/batman_trailer_facetime.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Batman answers the Riddler’s video call.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrNKA8"&gt;Not to mention that the trickiest villain in the &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; universe, the Riddler, seems to be a FaceTime aficionado — well, at least for trying to scare his enemies. After Batman accepts a call from an unknown contact, a chalky question mark symbol appears on his screen, with a figure that’s presumably the Riddler quickly entering the frame. A separate scene shows the Riddler gazing into his phone’s camera with a single goggle-covered eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XULdkk"&gt;The action-packed trailer gives us a taste of everything to come in &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; — action-packed car chases in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164886/batmobile-batman-matt-reeves-robert-pattinson-motorcycle-suit"&gt;the Batmobile&lt;/a&gt;, a possible romance between Batman and Catwoman, and the Riddler’s bizarre FaceTime calls. &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; was originally slated for release this year, but delays caused by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;pandemic pushed it back until March 4th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola will try foldable phones again with a third-generation Razr</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razr’s Quick View display is convenient" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PhCz_aJGzCQ-mAa_V9F0tn229UM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320913/dbohn_201023_4260_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a beloved phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgFVqx"&gt;Motorola is working on a new version of its Razr foldable smartphones, according to a Weibo post &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-razr-3-3079713/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/5517268716/L7wJbmcFk"&gt;The post&lt;/a&gt; is from Chen Jin, the general manager of the Lenovo Mobile Business Group in China (Lenovo is currently in charge of Motorola’s smartphone business), and describes how the company has been quietly working on a new addition to its lineup of foldable phones. It doesn’t have big shoes to fill — Motorola’s first two modern foldables were mediocre phones with hefty price tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7hOxN"&gt;We ran Jin’s post through a few translation sites, and while some parts didn’t make the jump to English, there are consistent details that show up in all the translations. The post mentions that the phone will have a better processor, better interface, and a tweaked appearance. At this early stage, though, it’s hard to say how different the third-gen device will be from the last one — the second-gen Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;more of a spec bump that added 5G&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a marked improvement from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;original Razr foldable&lt;/a&gt; announced in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3wjvnG52T1oiKg_NhAI7LThbdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128380/Screen_Shot_2021_12_27_at_12.11.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s translation of Jin’s Weibo post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VwPyMK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will the third time be the charm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iTVZO"&gt;Perhaps the third attempt at a foldable will be a charm — its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;previous two attempts&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;hard to recommend&lt;/a&gt;, even before Samsung released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;the exceptional Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; for $1,000. Today’s news, though, plus the fact that it’s still providing Android updates for them (albeit at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623902/motorola-razr-foldable-android-11-software-update-in-2021"&gt;a pretty slow pace&lt;/a&gt;), makes it seem like Motorola hasn’t given up on Razr revival. &lt;/p&gt;

We’ll be keeping our eyes out for more details or an announcement of this phone to see if it’s truly a notable upgrade or just another iteration of a forgettable foldable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcUQZd"&gt;Manuella Foz, a Motorola spokesperson, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “cannot comment on future devices” in response to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVt53W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original version of this article incorrectly stated that &lt;/em&gt;Android Police&lt;em&gt; spotted Jin’s Weibo post. The post was actually found by &lt;/em&gt;Android Authority&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California is suing Walmart over alleged improper disposal of e-waste and other hazardous materials</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYHQ2OMUWcWXm073Q-hC2zkykTI=/0x43:1000x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320602/Walmart_Store.1419979890.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zF1xKr"&gt;Last week, the California attorney general and 12 state officials &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-statewide-lawsuit-against-walmart-illegal"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Walmart, saying it allegedly illegally disposed of electronic and hazardous waste, compromising local landfills.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjdYJ6"&gt;California Attorney General Rob Bonta alleges in a statement the company violated state environmental laws with their practices, and the waste included materials like lithium and alkaline batteries, insect killer sprays, aerosol cans, LED lightbulbs, and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX8Y3Q"&gt;State investigators conducted 58 inspections across 13 counties from 2015 to 2021 and said they found classified hazardous and medical waste in each store’s trash compactors, as well as customer information that should have been rendered indecipherable. The California DOJ estimates that Walmart’s unlawfully disposed waste totals 159,600 pounds or more than 1 million items each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLvL4M"&gt;“We have met with the state numerous times to walk them through our industry-leading hazardous waste compliance programs in an effort to avoid litigation, but instead, they filed this unjustified lawsuit,” Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove said in a statement. “The state is demanding a level of compliance regarding waste disposal from our stores of common house-hold products and other items that goes beyond what is required by law. We intend to defend this company.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf9kuH"&gt;Hargrove said that the compactor waste audits “conducted or overseen by the California attorney general have shown that the compactor waste contain at most 0.4% of items of potential concern,” comparing it to the 3 percent statewide average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVa9sv"&gt;This is not the first time Walmart has tangled with the state over its alleged waste practices. In 2010, Walmart reached a $25 million settlement with the California attorney general’s office for illegally disposing of hazardous waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXnLod"&gt;Hargrove says the court was “prepared to relieve Walmart of its obligations” from its 2010 settlement, but “the attorney general’s office launched a new investigation with new rules in hope that Walmart would enter another settlement requiring another substantial financial payment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB1XpA"&gt;The company also paid $1.25 million to Missouri in 2012 for a similar incident and &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wal-mart-pleads-guilty-federal-environmental-crimes-admits-civil-violations-and-will-pay-more"&gt;pleaded guilty in 2013&lt;/a&gt; for negligently discharging a pollutant into drains in 16 counties in California, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-lawsuits-california-sacramento-hazardous-waste-6ac265da9f2cb150e8a73c7a5cc7e01b"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-walmart-lawsuit-llegal-hazardous-waste-landfills/"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Miks"&gt;“Despite repeated enforcements against Walmart over the past two decades, it consistently - and knowingly - fails to comply with California’s environmental protection laws,” director Meredith Williams of the Department of Toxic Substances Control in California said in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPybRu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story stated that Walmart had to pay a fine of $125 million in 2012. They only had to pay $1.25 million. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
