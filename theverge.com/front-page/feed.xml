    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends, and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;A NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 43 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;In California, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nhHjOx"&gt;By the way, if you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, because of low supplies of vaccine, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects to getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwQk0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0F1RM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Mario-themed Switch is available now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvgRQTxM0NLQWTBSTeifLDgYgTM=/486x0:5736x3500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808878/SM3DW_Lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo Switch Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QwoMeU"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, several retailers have a Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition Switch game console available for purchase. You can buy one right now at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-38-blue-edition%2F-%2FA-82242753%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGb5kj"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21116081/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-unique-joy-con-colors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;-themed Switch released last year&lt;/a&gt;, this limited-edition console stands out from other models, with the entire Switch and its accompanying accessories based on the outfit typically worn by the mustached plumber. Retailing for $300, the limited-edition Switch features an all-red console, a red dock stand, a pair of red Joy-Cons, a red casing around the screen, and a blue Joy-Con grip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AvudIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10338949"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HC5Y2"&gt;Additionally, for $300, the Mario-themed Switch also includes a screen protector and a special carrying case that includes various symbols associated with the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; franchise at no additional cost. The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;, which includes two more hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg2C5x"&gt;If you are planning to buy this console, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the device does not include a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;, despite both products having the same release date. Secondly, these limited-edition Nintendo Switch consoles tend to sell out quickly, and there’s no telling if and when it will be restocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VLC 4.0 coming this year with new interface for the popular video player</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axAnAY-IWRdchAmnkHYbRaZUXYI=/94x0:1113x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808654/msedge_UWAQ2jmRZM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of the new interface shown off in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: VideoLAN / FOSDEM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6babW1"&gt;Version 4.0 of VLC, the popular cross-platform media playing software, is planned for release in the coming months, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/vlc-history-open-source"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The big new feature is a redesigned interface, which VideoLAN foundation president Jean-Baptiste Kempf hopes will look “a bit more modern.” &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/next-up/vlc-video-player-turns-20?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the team is working on integrating more online content into the software, as well as a new way of running VLC in a webpage. It also has an IMDb competitor in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2ixO2"&gt;VLC’s developer VideoLAN gave the world a peek at what this &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/media_vlc/attachments/slides/3355/export/events/attachments/media_vlc/slides/3355/VLC_40_Slides.pdf"&gt;new interface&lt;/a&gt; could look like way back in February 2019 at the FOSDEM conference. Screenshots released at the time show an interface that ditches the player’s dated light grey color scheme in favor of a design featuring transparent interface elements, and modern-looking icons. “Do not worry,” Kempf jokes &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/media_vlc/"&gt;when presenting the images&lt;/a&gt;, “You can still use a command line.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DdTe_X_2VW4BW16Wl5ECp-cM554=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299592/msedge_LVmNVXZqJU.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VideoLAN / FOSDEM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a much more modern design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGgFUxxZwDAz9eWmeSrk1nMnxxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299607/msedge_papCLr26r1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: VideoLAN / FOSDEM&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interface playing a music file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="knfHWf"&gt;Alongside VLC 4.0, the VideoLAN team is also working to bring more online content into the software, with extensions to offer third-party videos. Offering free ad-supported videos in the future, similar to how Plex &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20995123/plex-free-movies-tv-streaming-service-now-available-ads"&gt;handles its own streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, is another possibility. As well as bringing online content into VLC, the team is developing a new version of the software that can more easily run inside a web page using Webassembly and JavaScript instead of the old browser plug-in. Kempf says that you’ll be able to play “any type of movie right inside your web browser” when it’s ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vcp5k1"&gt;Perhaps most intriguing is the Moviepedia Project, as it’s known internally. It’s an attempt to build an IMDb-style database for films, which can be edited and maintained by users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUsOlf"&gt;There’s no firm release date for when VLC 4.0 might arrive, but you can read more about VideoLAN’s planned features for the release in its &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/media_vlc/attachments/slides/3355/export/events/attachments/media_vlc/slides/3355/VLC_40_Slides.pdf"&gt;2019 presentation&lt;/a&gt; (or check out a &lt;a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/media_vlc.webm"&gt;recording here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7JKcrt"&gt;Dave Chappelle says that his long running beef with Comedy Central over rights to &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show&lt;/em&gt; is over. The surprise announcement came during a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/davechappelle/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;10-minute performance&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;em&gt;Redemption Song&lt;/em&gt; posted to Chappelle’s Instagram account late Thursday night. The clip closes with news that the sketch comedy will return to Netflix starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0OXBA"&gt;Netflix began airing &lt;em&gt;Chappelle’s Show&lt;/em&gt; on November 1st but pulled it on November 24th after the comedian complained that Comedy Central’s owner ViacomCBS licensed the show without his approval. “I called them and I told them that this makes me feel bad. And you want to know what they did,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CH-rR9znT3g/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;said Chappelle in a clip&lt;/a&gt; posted to Instagram on the morning of November 24th. “They agreed that they would take it off their platform just so I could feel better.” Netflix, which has been airing standup specials from Chappelle since 2016, has a lucrative contract with the performer worth tens of millions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNib19"&gt;Now, three months later, and 15 years after Chappelle famously walked off the show that aired on Comedy Central between 2003 and 2006, we have a resolution. According to Chapelle’s telling, Comedy Central reached out to him to make things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBZIzW"&gt;“I never asked Comedy Central for anything. If you remember I said ‘I’m going to my real boss and I came to you’ because I know where my power lies,” Chappelle said to the &lt;em&gt;Redemption Song&lt;/em&gt; audience. “I asked you to stop watching the show and thank god almighty for you, you did. You made that show worthless because without your eyes, it’s nothing. And when you stopped watching it they called me. And I got my name back. And I got my license back, and I got my show back, and they paid me millions of dollars. Thank you very much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caTWqJ"&gt;Chappelle then thanked Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos for his “courage,” and Chris McCarthy of ViacomCBS for “making the past right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TP3De0"&gt;“Finally after all of these years I can finally say to Comedy Central, ‘it’s been a pleasure doing business with you,’” said Chappelle in closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3xguc"&gt;Now, how about a nice game of shirts vs. blouses?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome for iOS will soon keep incognito tabs even more secret with Face ID</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSy5CGKTZU1p_c60NpZt7pLNVxY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808415/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x21rc4"&gt;Google is testing a new privacy feature to its Chrome browser for iOS that can lock incognito tabs behind Face ID. Apple’s facial recognition system is used to secure an iPhone or iPad, but many apps have their own Face ID support for extra security. Google has started testing securing incognito tabs behind Face ID in its latest Chrome iOS beta, signaling that it should arrive to regular users in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z2FpQ"&gt;Update notes for the latest Chrome 89 beta on iOS reveal that “when you return to the Chrome app, your incognito tabs will be blurred until you confirm it’s you.” You can enable this feature in the privacy section of Chrome’s settings, but it appears to be in early testing as not even every beta tester has access just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLAhxG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google Chrome on iOS is getting Face ID support that will protect and secure incognito tabs    &lt;a href="https://t.co/gnQmOzjdV6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gnQmOzjdV6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1359956601730400258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="osssnP"&gt;Chrome 89 is expected to debut in early March, but it’s not clear if the Face ID support will be ready in time. Google is also supporting Touch ID, for older devices. This feature is similar to &lt;a href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Tech-Talk/Samsung-Internet-Browser-Privacy-at-its-heart/td-p/5445029"&gt;Samsung’s secret mode&lt;/a&gt; in its mobile browser, which allows users to lock tabs with facial recognition or fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter permanently suspends conservative activist group Project Veritas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KhrNRsljQGa4gqzxIbUioeupZis=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808375/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CO78eV"&gt;Twitter has permanently suspended the account of conservative activist group Project Veritas, after the organization released a video of a reporter questioning a Facebook executive outside their home, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/11/us/impeachment-trial/twitter-suspends-project-veritas-a-conservative-group-over-tweets?referringSource=articleShare"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The account of Project Veritas’s founder, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII"&gt;James O’Keefe&lt;/a&gt;, was also temporarily locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uXt7N"&gt;In a statement given to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter said the @Project_Veritas account was suspended for “repeated violations of Twitter’s private information policy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xb5e1B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter says it repeatedly violated its private information policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h2n4f7"&gt;In a statement &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/project-veritas-suspended-twitter-468748"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Policito&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; O’Keefe said the offending video included footage of a reporter questioning Facebook vice president Guy Ronsen, but denied that Project Veritas had published his private information. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes that this questioning took place outside the executive’s home.  O’Keefe said the organization would not be taking down the offending coverage. “It would be unconscionable for me to take down our reporting where it didn’t violate anyone’s privacy rights,” he told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl1GjQ"&gt;After temporarily locking his account, Twitter said O’Keefe would need to delete a post that was in violation of its rules before he could tweet again. As of this writing, O’Keefe’s account is active once again, with two tweets labelled as unavailable on its feed. “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1360070705933672457"&gt;I’M BACK&lt;/a&gt;,” reads its pinned post, accompanied by a video outlining the group’s dispute with Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTWC6P"&gt;Prior to its suspension, Project Veritas’s Twitter account was prominent on the platform, and counted Donald Trump’s adult sons as followers. But others have questioned its tactics and the accuracy of its reporting. One of its videos about allegations of voter fraud was called “a domestic, coordinated elite disinformation campaign” by researchers at Stanford University and the University of Washington, &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;notes. Other examples of its videos include one which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/6/27/18760463/project-veritas-youtube-sting-james-okeefe"&gt;claimed to show evidence&lt;/a&gt; of bias against then-President Trump at Google, as well as another that claimed to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18243097/facebook-leaker-project-veritas-moderation-documents"&gt;bias against conservatives at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dbrand starts selling matte black PS5 plates and dares Sony to sue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Soi9Lg60G3k_mf3C_GLbsXIeh8=/0x0:1536x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808286/ps5__360__01_fd79c03e79f568f3a5f1969a45374077.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BbSGoq"&gt;It’s fair to say the PlayStation 5’s huge, two-tone industrial design is not for everyone, and now Dbrand says it has a solution. The company best known for its custom phone skins and cases has &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;put “Darkplates” on sale&lt;/a&gt;, with the promise that the precisely carved slabs of plastic will turn your PS5 into a murdered-out matte-black hunk of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8hGe0"&gt;This isn’t just an unofficial accessory — Dbrand is actively encouraging Sony to sue it for putting the product out. The background there is that a small company, first called PlateStation5 then CustomizeMyPlates, was &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-faceplate-seller-is-now-cancelling-all-orders-following-legal-action-from-sony/"&gt;forced to cancel and refund orders for a similar product&lt;/a&gt; last year following legal action from Sony. Now Dbrand’s order page reads “Go ahead, sue us” at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GN2pVh"&gt;The goading doesn’t stop there. Dbrand’s Darkplate features a texture somewhat inspired by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation button icons microtexture&lt;/a&gt; found on the PS5 and its controller. The company describes it as “a familiar-but-legally-distinct apocalyptic spin on the classic PlayStation button shapes.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFTTTm0DI1gc9k5jINAW5RRezfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299537/__3_faceplates_disc.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f6lRpZ"&gt;The Darkplate also has an optional skin for the glossy black middle section of the PS5, in case you want to customize its color or just make it less of a breeding ground for fingerprints. Beyond the matte black option, there are plain yellow and white skins as well as patterns like “robot camo” and “redcode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9rSPx"&gt;Converting your PS5 to matte black won’t be particularly cheap and might not be all that  quick. One set of plates sells for $49 plus shipping, while adding a middle skin takes the base price up to $60.95. All three waves of product set to ship in February, March, and April respectively have sold out in the past couple of hours, while a fourth wave for May is now available for backorder. The PS5 Digital Edition version of the plates, meanwhile, hasn’t yet been put on sale at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley’s big local co-op update has come to consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Stardew Valley" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnTR4Cq8-B_mQzU1Li5idxO8aIk=/86x0:1018x621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68807205/SDV_iPhone_10_half.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KocIhj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;’s 1.5 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193717/stardew-valley-update-pc-farming"&gt;delighted a lot of us when it came out for PC in December&lt;/a&gt;, and now it’s finally arriving for consoles. The game’s developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1359988190694629376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1359988190694629376%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the update should be rolling out to Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation “within the next couple of hours.” As of this writing, it is already available on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vn8qvH"&gt;The most notable feature in the update is local, split-screen co-op play, which seems absolutely perfect for consoles. Do I want to sit next to someone I love on the couch and build a farm together? Absolutely, yes, and now we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ0s2L"&gt;The update also includes a new Advanced Options menu, new buildings, animals, and enemies, and of course a crop of bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZXm1bi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Stardew Valley 1.5 Update for Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation are out, and should be available on all platforms within the next couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1359988190694629376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr1ioi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-full-changelog/"&gt;The full changelog is available on &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt;, and you can look through it yourself to see which changes excite you— we’re hyped for chairs that you can actually sit on, a menu tab that tells you if you’ve talked to someone that in-game day, and an entirely new region with its own quest and characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykcb8d"&gt;When we first covered this update, we called &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley &lt;/em&gt;our “forever game,” because a lot of us keep coming back to play it every time it’s updated. Despite the game’s popularity (&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-has-sold-more-than-10-million-copies/"&gt;it’s sold over 10 million copies&lt;/a&gt;), it still feels like a very personal project — just like my farm in the game, though I’ll admit that’s a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; less impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alexa can now greet people from your Ring Doorbell Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQfSsxf_Dx27xw_WPm7Ttly-2ho=/186x0:2028x1228/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806917/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_2.44.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell Pro can now talk to your visitors with Alexa.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSQzzs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.ring.com/2021/02/10/now-your-ring-video-doorbell-answers-the-door-for-you-with-smart-responses/"&gt;Amazon is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adding Alexa to its Ring Video Doorbell Pro, giving it the ability to talk to people when they come to your house. The feature is called Alexa Greetings, and requires that you have a Ring Protect subscription, which starts at $3 a month. If you do, Alexa can ask your visitors what they want, and they can choose to leave a video recording as a message. If they’re a delivery person, Alexa will be able to tell them where to leave the packages — assuming the delivery person is willing to talk to your robotic doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xy8hFM"&gt;Beyond automating the process of taking video messages and directing deliveries, it’s unclear if Alexa will bring any additional functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6PB2H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EyzJ4wVr8JI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar9kl1"&gt;The company is also announcing a Quick Replies feature, which should work on most of its doorbells without needing that subscription (though the company’s cheapest doorbell, the $60 Ring Video Doorbell Wired, isn’t getting that feature either). The feature lets you choose a canned response such as “we can’t answer the door right now, but if you’d like to leave a message, you can do it now” or “please leave the package outside. If you’d like to leave a message, you can do it now.” Of course, there are also replies that let the person standing at your door know that you’ll be there in just a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyguRv"&gt;Lastly, Amazon is also bringing a motion warning to some of its doorbells and cameras, which will audibly tell anyone around that Ring is recording if it detects motion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qvK1O"&gt;All the new features can be turned on or off in the Ring app, so if you don’t want Alexa answering the door for you, you can simply not enable the feature. Also, if we’re adding new features to the Ring doorbells, it would be great to see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227528/arlo-touchless-video-doorbell"&gt;a touchless doorbell function added&lt;/a&gt; (especially since most of these these new features require actually pressing the button).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iz6PFi"&gt;The announcements come at a time when the company is both receiving criticism for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;working with police to provide footage&lt;/a&gt; captured by Ring cameras, and attempting to increase the cameras’ appeal to privacy-centric users by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;testing end-to-end encryption support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tron invades Fortnite with Light Cycles and new skins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbp3hRkbcCqiSBruOIi25NQlt-w=/257x0:1877x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68806851/Et_fq5wXMAEgyf1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xReTHl"&gt;Today Epic revealed the latest crossover for its battle royale hit, which brings the &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/tron-outfits-arrive-in-fortnite"&gt;retrofuturistic world of &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HogqRG"&gt;There are ten different &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;-themed skins available in the in-game store right now, and each has a removable helmet. You can also get a Light Cycle glider and an Identity Disc pickaxe. It’s not yet clear whether you’ll be able to throw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CeMrLa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome to the Grid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gear up as Grid Warriors and fight for the users!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ3k5G"&gt;This season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been particularly busy when it comes to licensed crossovers. The season debuted with the inclusion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt;, who have since been joined by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief&lt;/a&gt;, the Predator, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also been a new skin based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics"&gt;Spanish streamer TheGrefg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;a line of soccer skins based on real-world teams&lt;/a&gt;. This followed a season that was entirely Marvel-themed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OKAPqB"&gt;Truly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
