    <title>Xbox chief: the best argument against the Xbox Series S was Sony</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UaPKAX"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series S wasn’t exactly a well kept secret, but the company’s decision to create a second next-gen Xbox to go up against the PS5 wasn’t an easy one. Ultimately, Microsoft’s decision to build two next-gen consoles came down to the company’s desire to reach a broader audience than Sony was targeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkV1T9"&gt;The Xbox Series S lacks the raw horsepower found in the larger Xbox Series X or the PS5. That’s left many wondering why Microsoft created two very different next-gen Xbox consoles, while Sony has focused on a single powerful PS5. Some Microsoft employees were even questioning the decision, and the company’s Xbox chief has revealed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “the best argument against doing [two next-gen consoles] was Sony.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A31BIP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21375453"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of gaming Phil Spencer says the idea of an entry level Xbox Series S “was questioned a number of times internally.” Despite the reservations and Spencer having “a ton of respect for what Sony does,” Microsoft persisted to create the $299 Series S as a more affordable entry point into next-gen gaming all with the knowledge that Sony was only pursuing high-end hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Kfh31U"&gt;“It was really this inclusion: how do we include more people in the launch euphoria and hype and everything that happens, and make it as accessible to [as many] more people as possible,” explains Spencer. “We want to think about how we bring more people into the gaming funnel, have more people experience this art form that we love,” says Spencer. “The pushback against [doing one console] was always, but we want to grow, we want to find new customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dbu9e2"&gt;The Xbox Series S &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441174/xbox-series-s-next-gen-gaming-performance-gpu-memory-hardware"&gt;complicates the next generation of gaming somewhat&lt;/a&gt;. Sony’s approach was to create two PS5 models with the same hardware specs, and one without a disc drive. “The way I would frame it, the best argument against doing [two-next gen consoles] was Sony,” reveals Spencer. “We didn’t think that they were going to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="st5aFr"&gt;Both the Xbox Series X and Series S are difficult to find and purchase right now, and that’s a situation that’s likely to last for months yet. “We started manufacturing late summer,” reveals Spencer. “We were a little bit later than the competition, because we were waiting for some specific AMD technology in our chip. We were a little bit behind where they were, where Sony was, in terms of building units.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hy_7FKghuNf4SQ-YdOI6iSnq7UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22015298/vpavic_4278_20201030_0120.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s PS5 console.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4IPSA2"&gt;That decision to hold for a full implementation of AMD’s RDNA 2 technologies will likely mean Sony has more units to ship out this holiday season. Microsoft hasn’t revealed what the benefits of having full RDNA 2 support will bring to Xbox Series X over the PS5, or why the company was willing to hold and impact its shipping plans. It’s a decision that could play out in what’s supported in games in the months and years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWN74d"&gt;For now, you’ll likely see more Xbox Series X devices available over the next year than Series S. While the Xbox Series S is positioned as the entry point, Spencer has revealed Microsoft is still currently manufacturing more Xbox Series X consoles than Series S to keep up with demand. “We figured that our first holiday, and probably our second holiday, you would see more of the higher end SKU, the Series X sold,” says Spencer. “We built more Series Xs than we did Series Ss. I think when we go into spring and summer, we’ll probably moderate that a bit. Over the long run, in most cases, price wins out.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZW8E5CtbikxomB2PeRzNbACsFmk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67798744/dseifert_201020_4247_0006.0.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Smart speaker and audio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRx7v2iKWDhr2lI1LUX0smT9vN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208402/dseifert_190915_3647_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sono’s portable Move speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3TO80R"&gt;Sonos has slashed the prices on several of its speakers ahead of Black Friday. Three of its popular models are $100 off right now, a savings of up to 25 percent. You can buy the Sonos Move, the company’s first portable speaker, for just $299 right now at Sonos and Amazon or $300 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="APQVzv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tWOj2e"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D4734HR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Beam is $299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (Usually $400). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great entry-level soundbar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sNyRnl"&gt;You can also buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087CCZH4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub add-on speaker at a discounted price for $599 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $700). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIQou8"&gt;If you’re looking for a compact and inexpensive smart speaker, both of the latest Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices are on sale. The 4th Gen Echo Dot is down to $29, which is the lowest price we’ve seen since its launch this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJS3T7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rkA3Fv"&gt;The Echo Dot’s compact design might not be appealing to everyone, but if you are looking for an Echo Device but want something a bit bigger, you can grab the Amazon Echo’s fourth-generation speaker for $70 right now at a few retailers, including Amazon and Target. Like this year’s Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo has an updated design that makes it more spherical in shape. It also has much improved audio quality and the ability to connect Zigbee smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8yyuQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1n5zT"&gt;Over at Adorama and Best Buy, you can buy a Google Nest Audio two-pack for $170 right now. A two-pack for this smart speaker would normally set you back $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U1SnqO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="of9IqM"&gt;Headphone deals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="61vp5x"&gt;You can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose’s excellent Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones&lt;/a&gt; for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q4QK379?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213175001080094" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1475153-REG%2Fbose_794297_0100_headphones_700_noise_cancelling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F6b3f#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. The price is only available in “soapstone white,” unfortunately, at all these retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IxWjk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYOJJg"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;amp;cjevent=bf1dd84529dc11eb814400030a24060c&amp;amp;utm_source=Vox+Media" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are $190 at Woot right now&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest we’ve seen yet on Apple’s flagship earbuds. Compared to the standard AirPods, the Pro model features better sound quality and noise cancellation, plus support for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULP9BI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AhnjK1"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds are down to just $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best price we’ve seen for this model, which usually costs $150 outside of any discounts. Compared to the standard Galaxy Buds, this upgraded model that launched alongside the Galaxy S20 series of phones has improved sound quality, microphones, and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5zWQ0"&gt;If you are looking to buy two pairs of Galaxy Buds Plus, Best Buy has a few bundles, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213386876980609" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;allowing you to buy sets for only $200&lt;/a&gt;. You can mix and match which color you want for both pairs and are available in blue, black, light blue, red, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wo6p68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581901" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArxGby"&gt;Alongside the Plus wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are discounted at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally, these earbuds would cost $130, but you can get them for $79 at Amazon or $80 at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttnzGj"&gt;Unfortunately, the color options are limited at both retailers, so you can only buy these earbuds in either black or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o58dM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586872"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LmyLtf"&gt;If you are looking to pick up an iPad Pro this Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B08637NV8M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Apple+iPad+11+inch+Pro&amp;amp;qid=1606161912&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=5f05426660dc58d28ae324183dffef5c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578293673083745" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have Apple’s high-end iPad Pro for $730. This model includes an 11-inch display and a 128GB storage configuration. If 128GB is not enough storage space for you, both retailers are taking $100 off the 256GB configuration, bringing the price down to $800, which is what you would normally pay if you bought the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro with the lowest storage configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GJf6F5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyzhPO"&gt;If you like Fitbit’s wearables and prefer to have a smartwatch by the company, you can get the Fitbit Sense smartwatch for $280 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724580973739712242" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1590667-REG%2Ffitbit_fb512bkbk_sense_gps_smartwatch_carbon.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model costs $330 and allows you to track your stress levels and measure your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAW1Mh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlkbsX"&gt;The Apple Watch SE was already the most affordable Watch that Apple made at $279, but it’s even cheaper at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=991c5b97a31528a6a07f9a0fae1bdb29&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578867741826427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can score the 40mm GPS version for $259 or the larger 44mm Watch for $289 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=e39bfa3f763e4fa56204c59a62303c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578918898824263" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Each size looks similar to the more expensive Series 6 but lacks the always-on display and a few other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Widfy"&gt;The Apple Watch SE aligns more with the Series 5 in terms of specs, but at $259, it’s a fantastic value. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;Here’s an in-depth post&lt;/a&gt; on how the SE differs from other recent Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="imKmLJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ffa5rt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6 is also cheaper than usual at Amazon and Walmart. Normally $400 for the 40mm GPS model, it’s down to $330 — but there’s a catch. You must buy this model in either red or blue at Amazon and Walmart only has the red model in this size discounted right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I6L1IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Blx9fM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, the latest installment in Ubisoft’s hack-anything, open-world game, the PS4 and Xbox One versions are down to $30 at Amazon and Best Buy.

The list goes on, though one thing that isn’t eligible are first-party Sony games for the PS5, like the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;remake, but you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Godfall, &lt;/em&gt;which is available on Sony’s next-gen console (and on PC.) Even &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; a game coming out next month is eligible for this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What happens when a virtual streamer doesn’t own her body?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8AQaFqTuTlvr0mPok0LntW97Gw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67869606/4312_Projekt_Meloday_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Projekt Melody briefly disappeared from Twitch due to a copyright dispute over her body&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xSdxxt"&gt;Projekt Melody swears her body belongs to her — the purple hair, the cat-eared bow, and all the barely there clothing that strategically covers her up. She commissioned it from an artist for $5,000 and even kept the receipts as proof. And for her thousands of fans &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/projektmelody"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, this is what they see when she streams herself playing &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, watching movies, or just sitting around chatting in her room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoRk9W"&gt;It wasn’t until this month that she ran into a problem: the artist, alleging that Melody owed him money, filed a copyright complaint claiming that she didn’t actually own her body — he did. Melody was banned from Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKt6th"&gt;It’s a strange situation, but one that could become more common. That’s because Melody is part of a growing wave of virtual streamers who broadcast using a 3D model in place of their body and face. The setup offers anonymity for the streamer and huge branding potential around the literal cartoon character they’re inhabiting. The model speaks and moves in accord with the person behind it, but viewers of the stream have no idea what that person actually looks like. They just hear her voice and see her reactions through the model that represents her. In the case of Melody, that’s a skinny anime woman with huge blue eyes, a croptop sweatshirt, and not much else. You can buy clothes, stickers, and pillows featuring her image, though the most popular form of merch seems to be posters of her in explicit poses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rLGL9q"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=TrustworthyPrettiestCurlewKippa&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AFgTxH"&gt;Many virtual streamers appear under a pseudonym, but Melody performs as a full-on invented character. According to Melody’s story, she’s some sort of perverted AI who started life as an email scanning app before being “attacked by a sexy virus” that made her obsessed with hentai. “My story is a strange one,” Melody says in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1dLmpfdL1g"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; explaining her origin. She’s gained more than 300,000 followers since joining Twitch in March. Before that, she was on YouTube, posting videos with titles like “ARE MY DRAWINGS TOO LEWD??” and “Is Hentai Art?” She also streams explicit performances on Chaturbate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wg4bDY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a trap that a lot of people fall into.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zxOU9"&gt;Virtual creators like Melody — a group broadly known as Vtubers — have recently picked up in popularity on Twitch in the US, after first gaining attention on YouTube (thus Vtubers, or “virtual YouTubers”) &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181002-the-virtual-vloggers-taking-over-youtube"&gt;in Japan&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago. In August, the top virtual streamers on Twitch, which included Melody, had more than 100,000 hours of viewership each, &lt;a href="https://blog.streamelements.com/state-of-the-stream-august-2020-fall-guys-has-an-incredible-debut-shroud-returns-to-twitch-and-9689227dc972"&gt;according to StreamElements and Arsenal.gg&lt;/a&gt;. The space got even more attention in September, when one of Twitch’s biggest streamers, Pokimane, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/14/21436437/pokimane-imane-anys-twitch-vtubing-vtuber-anime-livestream-mainstream-popularity"&gt;debuted a virtual version of herself&lt;/a&gt; to her audience of, at the time, 5.5 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7XqJr"&gt;As their numbers grow, Vtubers may face copyright issues that traditional creators — who often just market themselves and their slogans — don’t have to worry about. If a Vtuber relies on an outside artist to create their character, the Vtuber will need to ensure they get all of the rights they need in order to continue streaming as that character, modify that character later, and market merchandise using that character’s image. That means Melody’s artist might have a case: though she can defend herself with receipts, intellectual property experts say there’s little substitute for a clear contract outlining exactly what she’s able to do with her body, even if she otherwise created the character and commissioned the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IneOhx"&gt;In order to own the character art outright, a streamer would need to have that explicitly written into a work for hire contract, said David P. Swenson, a partner at Patterson Thuente who specializes in IP law. “This is a trap that a lot of people fall into,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Businesses that hire consultants or independent contractors often fail to write a sufficient contract and later realize, “‘Oh my gosh, the person who created the work actually has copyrights in it.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lvCx9v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npqsLlJ8xzs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0mCtJ4"&gt;The artist who made Melody’s body, DigitrevX, said in his copyright complaint with Twitch that he owned the 3D model that currently represents her, according to a note Melody posted to Twitter. “A 3D modeler (DigitrevX) filed DMCA takedowns on all of my VODs, claiming he owns the copyright to my body,” Melody wrote. Because she received multiple copyright strikes, that made her a “repeat infringer,” Twitch wrote in an email posted by Melody, leading to a ban from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5ckIO"&gt;Melody doesn’t dispute that DigitrevX made her body or other assets that she’s used in the past. But she says that DigitrevX sold her complete ownership of her primary assets and design, so his copyright complaint isn’t valid. She posted images showing what appears to be a sales receipt for her character’s body, listing the design, model, and special features like blinking and “dynamic bone set up” as part of the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3lY4OZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vtubers need to buy specific rights for how their bodies can be used&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6ys0I"&gt;The page doesn’t state how Melody is allowed to use those assets, though. In another dump of images, which Melody says are Twitter DMs between herself and the artist, DigitrevX is shown saying he’d like to be listed on the copyright registration but that “you own the IP.” He goes on to say that it’ll be “nice to have something” to prove who owns what later on. “I helped but in the end this is yours,” DigitrevX wrote, according to Melody’s screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz8CAn"&gt;That alone may not be enough, though. “That in and of itself is a hollow statement,” Swenson said. “It’s a meaningless statement because the question is &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; IP rights do they have?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFWUZc"&gt;Melody may not be entirely out of luck if there was nothing in writing. In cases where it’s understood how a buyer is going to use an artist’s work — like a photographer taking a headshot for an actor’s website — there may be an implied license, even if those terms aren’t spelled out. “That’s what the court would look to: what is the scope of the implied license?” Cheryl L. Burbach, a partner at Hovey Williams who specializes in IP law, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Clearly you’re not going to pay someone to buy artwork that you never intend to use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DpJug8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=GlutenFreeNiceMetalDancingBanana&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CV9rpN"&gt;The process of getting a Vtube model created differs from streamer to streamer. Teru, an artist who has made 3D models for Vtubers (and is also a Vtuber herself), said that some people come to her with an existing design to turn into a model, but other people pay her to create the character from scratch. It can take a few weeks to make a 2D model, and potentially longer for a 3D model. Teru says she explicitly outlines what rights the buyer has to the work — usually, “they can pretty much do anything they want with it,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a message on Discord. Her only requirement is getting credited as the designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAuqEi"&gt;The English-language Vtube scene is mostly filled with independent artists, though, Teru said, and knowing to outline specific rights to a purchase is something artists often learn as they gain experience. “Issues like what happened with Melody might actually raise awareness so both artists and commissioners learn that they have to settle and agree on their terms before they work together,” Teru said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BZxIgQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I finally blocked him after he kept saying shitty things about me.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Svhu02"&gt;DigitrevX hasn’t disputed Melody’s account of why she was banned or what she owns the rights to, but he has aired grievances with her. The artist said on Twitter that he stopped working with Melody earlier this year, claiming that she failed to pay him for “months of support” that included “free assets, fixes, and project management.” He then asked her to sign a “service deal” for ongoing support, which she refused. “She didn’t pay for the service deal nor the work I did leading up to it. So I said bye,” DigitrevX wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUfqZ0"&gt;Melody claims she offered to pay for the “free” work, but DigitrevX refused. He continued to be “rude” and “insulting,” Melody wrote, so she eventually cut ties. “I finally blocked him after he kept saying shitty things about me, and now he has resorted to trying to de-platform me, starting with twitch,” Melody wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCMUDa"&gt;Twitch and Melody did not respond to requests for comment. DigitrevX declined to comment, saying he was discussing with Melody’s team “how we can put this past us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5ih7F"&gt;Melody’s Twitch account was reinstated a day after being banned, but her account wasn’t entirely restored. She was previously a Twitch partner — a status that confers additional community perks and monetization options — but her partnership has been revoked since the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sq6VtU"&gt;Fortunately for Melody, she has other accounts across the web. She posts game videos and reactions to YouTube, sells merch in an online store, trolls her fans on Twitter, accepts donations on Patreon, and even has a following on Pornhub. If something goes wrong on Twitch, she’s readied plenty of other spaces to fall back on and a diversified revenue stream — like any good influencer, real or virtual.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will add an epilepsy warning to photosensitive videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYCMdXl8noh7K4T22qsXBt5-IKw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67869288/acastro_190402_3308_Guide_TikTok_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SVvYm2"&gt;TikTok is adding a new feature that will help people who have epilepsy to avoid potentially dangerous photosensitive content. The short video platform already warns creators if their uploads contain effects that could trigger photosensitive epilepsy, but now anyone who encounters an example in their feed will get an alert that allows them to opt out of viewing such content in the future. There’ll also be a toggle in the app’s accessibility settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W33Njv"&gt;The Epilepsy Foundation of America &lt;a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/make-difference/public-awareness/1-26"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that 1 in 26 people in the US will develop epilepsy at some point, with a tenth of people being affected by seizures. Video content that involves flashing lights and colors can trigger seizures, so it’s important for people to be able to control what they’re able to see — particularly on a social platform like TikTok where content is actively pushed to users through an algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKLKP4"&gt;Here’s how the controls will appear in the app:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jdjZFYecBvQDMyChuynyGCTLcas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22071752/tt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DxxyIM"&gt;“While the population of those with photosensitive epilepsy is small, the impact can be quite serious,” says Laura Thrall, president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation. “It is great to see TikTok addressing this issue by making changes to their platform so that people in our epilepsy community can feel protected when viewing content on TikTok. We are proud to have worked with TikTok on this initiative and truly appreciate our continued collaboration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THGLXn"&gt;TikTok says it’s also been collaborating with epilepsy organizations in Europe, Japan, and South Korea who provided feedback on how the company could help make the app safer. The feature will be available in the “coming weeks,” according to TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk overtakes Bill Gates to become world’s second richest person behind Jeff Bezos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Visits Germany" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Zv0Z2CvBmKu1ewWGrFSb6Af9kY=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67869138/1270402636.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hDn9H"&gt;Elon Musk has passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the world’s second richest person, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/"&gt;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt;. The Tesla CEO’s net worth now sits at around $128 billion, after increasing by $100 billion this year. There is a sizable gap between Musk and the number one spot, which is currently held by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos who has a reported net worth of around $182 billion. In January, Musk ranked 35th on the list, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/musk-overtakes-gates-to-grab-world-s-second-richest-ranking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmSLYU"&gt;For an idea of how the wealth of these men compares to the average American household, check out this &lt;a href="https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/"&gt;amazing data visualization produced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in which every pixel represents $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOXgWf"&gt;Musk’s rapid ascent up the list has mainly been driven by Tesla’s share price. The car company currently has a market cap of almost $500 billion, after starting the year at under $100 billion. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/24/elon-musk-bill-gates-tesla-share-price-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla has the highest market cap of any car company in the world, despite producing a fraction of the cars of more established automakers. This year it expects to produce 500,000 cars, compared to around 10 million for a company like Toyota. Around three quarters of Musk’s net worth consists of Tesla shares, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8JZUPN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk and Gates have publicly sparred this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vT1Cj"&gt;Musk’s other major venture, SpaceX, has also seen recent success. Last week the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21565505/spacex-crew-1-dragon-docking-success-iss-space-station"&gt;transported four astronauts to the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft. It follows the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;first crewed flight to space&lt;/a&gt; in May this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcEahR"&gt;Bill Gates sat atop the Billionaires Index for years until he was overtaken by Jeff Bezos in 2017. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Gates would probably have a higher net wealth right now if he hadn’t given so much money to charity, including the over $27 billion he’s donated through the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZTu9X"&gt;Gates and Musk have had some high-profile disagreements this year. In September, Musk said Gates had “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1304792315634966529"&gt;no clue&lt;/a&gt;” about the viability of electric trucks, after the Microsoft co-founder said that electric semi-trucks, along with electric cargo ships and passenger jets, will “&lt;a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Moving-around-in-a-zero-carbon-world"&gt;probably never&lt;/a&gt;” be practical. Earlier this year Gates &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/bill-gates-lies-spread-faster-than-facts-on-social-media.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Musk should avoid making big predictions about areas he’s not familiar with, after the Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241180/elon-musk-coronavirus-conspiracy-misinformation-tesla"&gt;downplayed the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuFR0p"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/17/elon-musk-tesla-shares-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-s-p500"&gt;overtook Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week&lt;/a&gt; when he became the third-richest person on the Billionaires Index. Zuckerberg has since fallen to fifth in the rankings after he was overtaken by French businessman Bernard Arnault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLIvSt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s Game &amp; Watch can run Doom, barely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2QNN5CPzoDogJNBv0ppdqpqhM-Y=/85x0:760x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67868283/doom_game_watch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: stacksmashing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pMLfTo"&gt;Intrepid developers have done the expected &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;necessary: &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; now runs on Nintendo’s recently released Game &amp;amp; Watch portable. The Game &amp;amp; Watch: &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; was designed to run three games, but successfully porting &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;shows it can handle others if you have a lot of patience (&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/11/22/doom-running-on-the-nintendo-game-watch/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Hackaday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQSGuB"&gt;This version of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; is not perfect, of course. In order to get the game to run even at the slower speed shown in the video below, sound had to be disabled and textures had to be simplified to fit the game on the small portable. And getting that far wasn’t easy: programmers &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3S8vxwRfqLBdIhgRlDRVzw"&gt;stacksmashing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kbeckmann"&gt;Konrad Beckmann&lt;/a&gt; had to trick the Game &amp;amp; Watch to offload its firmware by injecting code into the external storage accessed by the Game &amp;amp; Watch’s tiny microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5rQzkC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNg_S9UM5ps?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJqzSR"&gt;Finding a version of &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;small enough to fit on the Game &amp;amp; Watch’s meager amount of storage was a separate issue. The hackers settled on a package called “Minimal &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;IWAD” that replaces the game’s original textures with simplified versions, but they still had to make further adjustments like disabling sound to work within the Game &amp;amp; Watch’s 1.1 MB of usable storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvDZ0N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"&gt;The Game &amp;amp; Watch: &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is designed to evoke Nintendo’s original Game &amp;amp; Watch handhelds, while running a version of Nintendo’s NES classic, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.,&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 2 &lt;/em&gt;(known in the West as &lt;em&gt;The Lost Levels&lt;/em&gt;). (It also runs a Mario-themed version of the Game &amp;amp; Watch game &lt;em&gt;Ball).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;’s demon-slaying action wasn’t ported to a Nintendo console until the more powerful SNES was released, so showing up on a tiny device designed to run NES games is as unusual as it is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFExYY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; is an old standby for programmers experimenting with homebrew games. The game has showed up in all sorts of places: from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514030/microsoft-xcloud-samsung-smart-fridge-doom-enternal-xbox-games-android"&gt;Samsung refrigerator running xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338092/minecraft-windows-95-pc-doom-vm-computers-mod"&gt;Windows PC built in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/21/13697058/macbook-touchbar-doom-hack-sure-why-not"&gt;the Touch Bar of a MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to this work, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; seems right at home on a Game &amp;amp; Watch, and soon, other homebrew games might be, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nFb2IG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo’s new Game and Watch handheld proves the company goes its own way","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitter to show a warning when you try to like a labeled tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HOE-iws7BRx-YR6xkTHgEc5dg9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867885/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4jqRo9"&gt;Ahead of the 2020 election, Twitter began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509439/twitter-election-trump-quote-tweet-labels-rules-election"&gt;showing a warning&lt;/a&gt; if you tried to retweet a tweet that had been labeled for potentially including misleading information. Twitter is now planning to expand that warning functionality to when you try to like a labeled tweet, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1331018136712261632"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality is rolling out on the web and iOS globally this week, and it will come to Android in the coming weeks, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajlzbm"&gt;Adding a warning decreased quote tweets of misleading information by 29 percent, the company said. It seems Twitter is hoping this new warning shown before likes of labeled tweets will reduce the amount of likes on labeled content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xRyF0w"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Giving context on why a labeled Tweet is misleading under our election, COVID-19, and synthetic and manipulated media rules is vital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These prompts helped decrease Quote Tweets of misleading information by 29% so we're expanding them to show when you tap to like a labeled Tweet. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WTK164nMfZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WTK164nMfZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1331018136712261632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7BP17z"&gt;The warnings ahead of retweets and likes on labeled tweets aren’t the only restrictions Twitter has recently put in place to add some friction to the platform and reduce the spread of misinformation. Currently, when users try to share a retweet, Twitter will open a window to compose a quote tweet instead of immediately sharing that tweet with your followers. You don’t have to write anything, though, and you can still post a standard retweet — just hit the “Retweet” button in the compose window. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524092/twitter-temporarily-changing-retweet-quote-tweet-election"&gt;Here’s our guide&lt;/a&gt; about how to retweet with the new format.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gicD4k"&gt;Twitter last said the warnings before retweets of labeled tweets and the changes to how you retweet would be in place until “at least” the end of election week in the US. I’m still seeing the restrictions in place, nearly three weeks since Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vho2h2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 23rd, 7:54PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added rollout information from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Black Friday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, Apple’s direct website will mark down prices on several products beginning on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. If you buy an eligible product during Apple’s Black Friday event, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583192%2Fapple-deals-black-friday-tech-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the tech giant will give you up to a $150 gift card&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcLyrb"&gt;Below, we have listed all of the best Black Friday discounts you can take advantage of if you are looking to buy any Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube tests whether you’ll ever get sick of Bad Guy with an endless Billie Eilish mashup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Infinite Bad Guy site. The “Bad Guy” video is in the middle, in front of a black and green background. Tags like “violin fam” and “instrumental” scroll across the bottom." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3LzfynuFF1itxMb_FY7gVaH-ajk=/121x0:1264x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867262/infinite_bad_guy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Infinite Bad Guy” featuring Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” music video. | Google/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aCxeYV"&gt;Somehow, perhaps by some cosmic intervention, I haven’t gotten tired of hearing Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” on the radio. Apparently, I’m not the only one because tens of thousands of people have gone to the effort of making covers of the song and uploading them to YouTube. In celebration of its music video passing 1 billion views, YouTube and Google Creative Lab have turned all of those covers into an interactive AI experiment. “Infinite Bad Guy,” which YouTube calls “the world’s first infinite music video,” collects thousands of covers and blends them together, using machine learning to align each one within quarter-beats of the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PZlBgP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OqY_IV3gj7E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIgorH"&gt;Going to &lt;a href="https://billie.withyoutube.com/"&gt;billie.withyoutube.com&lt;/a&gt; pulls up the original “Bad Guy” music video with cover videos on either side, set against a background of hundreds of tiny video thumbnails floating around a black void. When you click over from one video to another, the second will pick up on the same beat the first left off on. Pausing pulls up stats about how many covers you’ve watched and how many times you’ve played through a full loop of the song. When the song reaches the drop at the bridge, the color of the interface turns from green to red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gof5Pq"&gt;The fun thing is that they’ve also curated different tags that you can browse. There are predictable keywords like guitar, choir, and signing (for sign language covers) as well as some funkier selections like ASMR, cat, and… toy chicken? As I clicked around, I became less interested in the actual song and more in the variety of instruments, genres, and goofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dECuV6"&gt;It’s a cool premise, though not quite seamless. When I tried it out, there was a bit of a lag as each video loaded, so it doesn’t exactly satisfy the craving for a fluid DJ mix. Differences in quality are particularly evident when covers are played back to back — out of thousands of covers, not all of them are going to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; covers. Some of the “covers” are actually just homemade music videos set to the original audio. There also isn’t audio leveling from one video to the next, so you may end up fiddling with your volume as you travel through the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WaAt1"&gt;Despite some clunkiness, it’s an engaging way to spend a few minutes away from the usual algorithms. I recommend you &lt;a href="https://billie.withyoutube.com/"&gt;experience it yourself&lt;/a&gt; and see how many melodica solos you can get through before you close your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qb0bLb"&gt;The US government awarded a big transportation contract to Uber and Lyft this week, authorizing the ride-hailing companies to provide transportation to up to 4 million federal employees and their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji5dtp"&gt;The General Services Administration, the procurement arm for the federal government, granted the five-year contract to Uber and Lyft, the companies confirmed. The contract is worth up to $810 million, though it’s unclear how much each company will receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOtwZ"&gt;While individual federal employees have previously been able to use ride-hail services for travel, the new contract allows the companies to formally launch their services within agencies and directly work with officials to promote the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wF6edy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a natural next step for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKtDi6"&gt;The contract was awarded to Uber for Business, the ride-hailing company’s business-to-business division. “The expansion of our customer base to include government is a natural next step for us, and we’re proud to help federal agencies tackle some of the biggest administrative challenges they face,” Ronnie Gurion, global head of Uber for Business, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfJlKJ"&gt;Lyft also hailed the contract as a good sign for the growth of its business. “Lyft already works closely with select agencies, but with this award under our belt, we see an opportunity to be the preferred rideshare partner for many other top federal agencies,” a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayEiFS"&gt;A spokesperson for GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2020/04/10/gsa-makes-travel-easier-and-cheaper-for-feds-when-they-rideshare"&gt;blog post back in April&lt;/a&gt;, the agency said it was able to negotiate a 2–4 percent discount with the companies, compared with large commercial customers. Uber and Lyft also agreed to waive technology fees charged to use back-office vendor data and reporting capabilities, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euDCTM"&gt;The contract with Uber and Lyft “modernizes official travel and will make it easier, and cheaper, to use rideshare services for official travel,” Federal Acquisition Service Assistant Commissioner for Travel, Transportation and Logistics Charlotte Phelan wrote. “No new apps to download - and no paper receipts to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
