    <title>The Matrix Awakens is an interactive tech demo for PS5 and Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zOb0W7TsB_IKl2m4ojwN0g1Ti8=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234957/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_12_06_15_32_47.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CRcZ3y"&gt;Epic Games has created &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, an interactive tech demo built in Unreal Engine 5. A teaser for the interactive &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; experience appeared today, and the tech demo will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You can pre-install the demo right now (29GB) &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP1464-PPSA05754_00-MATRIXUNREALDEMO"&gt;on PS5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience%2F9ng8rk1f3hcc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820392%2Fthe-matrix-awakens-epic-games-tech-demo-unreal-engine-5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, and it will launch during The Game Awards on December 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nDHLj"&gt;Members of the original movie team, including Lana Wachowski, have worked with Epic Games to create &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Awakens&lt;/em&gt;. The Xbox store listing promises “a wild ride into the reality-bending universe of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; that features performances by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48ygme"&gt;The teaser video appears to show a digital version of Keanu Reeves and not the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; kind. “How do we know what is real?” Reeves asks, mysteriously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o78Vss-KZD-gLf_5SU1Fvr8WNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067059/JC1uYno.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this another digital Keanu Reeves?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IkadvX"&gt;Epic Games originally announced its Unreal Engine 5 with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date"&gt;stunning PlayStation 5 tech demo last year&lt;/a&gt;. It included photo-realistic lighting, incredibly visual quality, and a level of game detail that Unreal Engine 5 promises to deliver for next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CKZni"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;Matrix &lt;/em&gt;tech demo could be equally impressive, with the teaser claiming it will offer “a glimpse into the future of interactive storytelling and entertainment with UE5 in this free, boundary-pushing cinematic and real-time tech demo.” It arrives just ahead of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; theater release on December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash launches ‘ultra-fast’ delivery in NYC, with couriers who are actual employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tZW2DE-pSXexPuT1uiM-gSumueY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234913/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash “fast” delivery comes to New York Cityfv | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Cp4RR"&gt;Food delivery platform DoorDash has &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Introduces-Ultra-Fast-Grocery-Delivery-Providing-Busy-Consumers-with-a-Reliable-and-Convenient-Way-to-Restock-Instantly/default.aspx"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its “ultra-fast” DashMart delivery service in New York City because apparently delivery &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;couriers aren’t already frazzled enough&lt;/a&gt; and no one can possibly wait more than 15 minutes for anything (not quite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95516647"&gt;what Andy Warhol predicted&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re way past that now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWBaqA"&gt;However, there is a key difference between the delivery jobs on the main DoorDash platform and positions with the new DashMart fast delivery service: DashMart workers will be part of what the company calls DashCorps, considered full- and part-time employees — instead of independent contractors — and many will be eligible for benefits. DashCorps workers will have set schedules and be paid $15 per hour, plus tips, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1"&gt;To start in NYC, the ultra-fast deliveries — which will arrive within 10 to 15 minutes of order times — will come from a DashMart location in Chelsea that’s open from 7AM to 2AM daily, with more locations to follow soon. The Chelsea DashMart has more than 2,000 items including fresh and frozen foods, household goods, and local products, the company says. Customers can order via the DoorDash app or website; those who have its DashPass membership won’t be charged delivery fees. DoorDash will donate excess DashMart produce to a local community food bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdCJlU"&gt;“Achieving ultra-fast delivery times inherently requires more structure and organization to ensure orders are fulfilled quickly and merchant and customer expectations are met,” the company’s director of new verticals Andrew Ladd &lt;a href="https://doordash.news/2021/12/06/introducing-ultra-fast-deliveries-with-doordash/"&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. DashCorps workers will use a different app than workers for the standard DoorDash platform, wear uniforms, and in addition to deliveries, will perform other tasks including stocking shelves, customer support, and administrative work. The roles are “fundamentally different from dashing,” Ladd added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QZlF62"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Revolt of the delivery workers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cF3JbK"&gt;DoorDash first &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/introducing-dashmart-1891ecc0257d"&gt;announced the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its DashMart stores in eight cities in August 2020. Unlike the Chelsea location, the first DashMarts didn’t have brick-and-mortar locations, functioning kind of like ghost kitchens for convenience stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23IllV"&gt;Why would someone want to continue working for the main DoorDash platform when the seemingly more attractive DashCorps jobs are available? Ladd writes that the “binary choice between working as an employee or an independent contractor” is “outdated and doesn’t reflect the needs of the modern workforce.” Its independent contractor “Dashers” prefer the flexibility over their schedules that DoorDash offers, the company claims, and “we’re steadfastly committed to protecting and strengthening this independent workforce.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA7iTA"&gt;The benefits for those DashCorps workers who are eligible would include those that “traditionally come with employment,” including medical, dental, vision, flexible spending accounts, and commuter benefits, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAitFw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Windows app will let you know if games play well on your PC before you download them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOC99JyvdYjl3fRkORcIM1QD7lI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234866/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DwRcqz"&gt;Microsoft is adding a simple label to its Xbox app for Windows, letting PC gamers know if a title runs well on their machine before they go ahead and download it. The feature is currently in testing and limited to certain games before it rolls out to all Xbox app users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLMSj5"&gt;While system requirements have always been listed in the Xbox app, this simple label should make it easier for PC owners to figure out if a game can run on their system. Microsoft is running a performance check against a variety of PC games to build this label.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XxSy3sPOoZ4O-A-JqkF01Y-ttVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066897/qMewYBb.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new label in the Xbox app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1RkvPc"&gt;There are a number of games that don’t have the label yet and simply show “performance check not available yet,” which suggests the Xbox app doesn’t just simply check your PC system requirements. It appears Microsoft is building its own database of how well PC games run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kpJpk"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t officially detailed this new performance check yet, so it’s not clear if the label is based on the minimum specifications for a game, the recommended ones, or other system information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8psSXU"&gt;If the ratings are reliable, it could be an easy alternative to using third-party tools and websites like &lt;a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri"&gt;Can You Run It&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re interested in trying out this new label or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791013/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-install-folders"&gt;ability to install PC games more freely&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft is allowing everyone to test this new version of the Xbox app. All you need to do is download the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-insider-hub%2F9pldpg46g47z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Insider app&lt;/a&gt; and opt into the Windows gaming preview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp now lets you set all chats to disappear by default  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JVDz9wDJ7KBUiebHjbb2bQ0o7A=/0x0:3491x2327/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234600/DisappearingMessagesComms_Web_Website_Static_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new features in action.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: WhatsApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHLbm7"&gt;WhatsApp is adding new functionality to its &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages/?lang=en"&gt;disappearing messages feature&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users set messages in a chat to automatically be deleted after a set period of time. WhatsApp says users will now have the option to turn on disappearing messages automatically for &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;their new one-on-one chats, so that all future messages will be automatically deleted from the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5J9XD"&gt;The Meta-owned messaging service also says it’s giving users more options for how long before a message is deleted. When the feature first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550634/whatsapp-disappearing-messages-feature"&gt;launched in November last year&lt;/a&gt;, users only had the option of having messages disappear after seven days. Going forward, however, there will also be the option of deleting them after just 24 hours or 90 days. The new functionality was previously reported as being in development &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-17-16-whats-new/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="guFbsO"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed" style="max-width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 188.8889%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114134070256701" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fplugins%2Fpost.php%3Fhref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Fzuck%252Fposts%252F10114134070256701&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2dMbk0"&gt;WhatsApp notes that turning on disappearing messages by default won’t affect existing chats. When you start a new one-on-one chat, a notice will appear to say that the disappearing messages feature is turned on, alongside a note that says it’s on by default (so your contacts don’t think it’s anything personal). You also have the option of turning the setting off for individual chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcnyqR"&gt;Although the new default setting doesn’t affect group chats, WhatsApp says it’s added a new option when creating groups to let you enable the disappearing messages feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xY8FLD"&gt;WhatsApp says the new features are available now across all platforms. Instructions for how to use them3m4 can be found in &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/chats/about-disappearing-messages"&gt;WhatsApp’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos is gone, but ads for shady tests aren’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psdUmh6jGzKCut-AzJ9ZxaWLdJw=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234636/czapatka_180518_1777_blood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Theranos claimed it could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood.  | Photo by Cory Zapatka / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Companies can market tests that don’t have FDA approval&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YsyWO6"&gt;The advertisement was slick and emotionally compelling: real patients, lined up to share how blood testing was a stressful and draining experience, are told about a new test that only needs one single drop of blood. They’re grateful, almost overwhelmed. Then, there’s a tiny vial, accompanied by the phrase “the tiny blood test,” before the Theranos logo &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F185518071%3Futm_campaign%3D5370367%26utm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_channel%3Daffiliate%26cjevent%3D7395e650426311ec81ce17cb0a82b836%26clickid%3D7395e650426311ec81ce17cb0a82b836&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22816112%2Ftheranos-lab-developed-test-fda-regulation-everlywell" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appears on-screen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaijex"&gt;The question of whether Theranos ads were misleading, and whether ads like that one were &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/06/07/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-experimented-arizonans-bad-blood-book/675541002/"&gt;put on television&lt;/a&gt; even though Elizabeth Holmes &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; they were misleading, is part of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/us-v-elizabeth-holmes-et-al"&gt;the case against Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, who’s on trial in San Jose, California for 11 counts of wire fraud. But the advertisement’s existence raises a bigger question about how the federal government and Food and Drug Administration regulate medical tests: why was Theranos able to advertise its tests — which weren’t FDA approved — at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwYti0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;why was Theranos able to advertise its tests — which weren’t FDA approved — at all?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lLbCKQ"&gt;Answering that question requires diving into byzantine FDA rules and regulations around medical testing, as well as how, exactly, the agency applies them. Theranos’ tests fell into a category called “lab-developed tests” for which FDA oversight is limited. If a test is designed by and used in a single lab, that lab is allowed to sell and advertise the test without the FDA’s sign-off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiBBLI"&gt;The agency hadn’t changed its approach to lab-developed tests much before Theranos, even as technology advanced and these tests started to be marketed directly to consumers. It hasn’t made changes since Theranos flamed out, even though — as testimony throughout the Holmes trial highlighted — bad tests can put patients at risk, both physically and psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZatHBT"&gt;Take Everlywell, which sells at-home test kits for things like sexually transmitted diseases and cholesterol — apart from its COVID-19 product, it’s tests are &lt;a href="https://support.everlywell.com/article/58-how-does-everlywell-validate-the-reliability-credibility-of-your-labs"&gt;not FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt;. All told, companies marketing lab-developed tests are claiming to be able to diagnose dozens of conditions affecting millions of people. But the tests behind these claims are subject to far less scrutiny than tests that have gone through an FDA &lt;a href="https://www.testing.com/articles/commercial-tests-fda-approval/"&gt;review process&lt;/a&gt; — which at minimum requires registering with the agency and, for many tests, involves a detailed analysis on the tests’ performance. The minutiae of how and why those are different, though, isn’t easily apparent to anyone who isn’t an expert in medical testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="re1I9Z"&gt;“I don’t think most people understand the difference” between lab-developed tests and FDA-approved ones, says Ana Rutschman, an assistant professor in the Center for Health Law Studies at Saint Louis University School of Law. It’s not realistic to expect them to, she says. But understanding the difference is the only way to know what you’re getting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1qH5nY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broad category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TWpOC1"&gt;There’s a good reason lab-developed tests exist: they give labs the ability to develop and sell their own tests, which is important when there’s a gap in the types of FDA-approved tests offered or during an emergency. Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-new-policy-help-expedite-availability-diagnostics"&gt;one roadblock&lt;/a&gt; in the rollout of virus testing was that the public health emergency meant labs were not allowed to deploy their own in-house tests for the coronavirus — everything had to get FDA authorization, which slowed the process. As that authorization process later illustrated, many lab-developed tests, even ones developed quickly, are very reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F0lB3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the category itself is very broad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aCEqm4"&gt;But other lab-developed tests might not be as reliable. Part of the challenge in evaluating these tests is that the category itself is very broad, says David Grenache, former president of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. An FDA-approved test would become “lab-developed” — no longer qualifying as FDA-approved — if a lab makes any changes to the protocol under which the FDA approved it. For example, if a test was approved using saliva samples collected at an urgent care clinic, and that same test was run using a saliva sample collected at home, it could be considered lab-developed. “They’ve altered the packaging, or the way the test is supposed to be performed, so now we’re going to call it lab-developed,” Grenache says. Theranos took that route for some of its tests, which it ran on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-testimony.html"&gt;modified equipment&lt;/a&gt; from testing company Siemens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUya6N"&gt;But lab-developed tests can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; include brand-new tests that aren’t just slight modifications to FDA-approved products — like, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2015/11/11/9706356/fda-theranos-health-diagnostics-cancer-tests-regulation-loophole-ldt"&gt;genetic tests that claim to detect cancers&lt;/a&gt;. And just like a simple test tweaked to work off an at-home saliva sample, a test claiming to flag genes that could cause cancer growth could advertise to the general public without any input from the FDA at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7cv52"&gt;The FDA is still responsible for overseeing lab-developed tests, and the agency can (and should) step in if a test is harmful. It has sent warning letters to companies like &lt;a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/fda-issues-warning-letter-to-lab-marketing-three-laboratory-developed-tests"&gt;Inova Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, which was promoting a test it said could predict how people would react to certain medications. The agency wrote that the tests didn’t have valid data backing them and “pose significant public health concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyGv7S"&gt;That intervention came &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the tests were already being sold to patients. The FDA doesn’t regularly check in on the tests done by labs, and only steps in if there’s a complaint or if someone brings a problem to its attention. “There aren’t really FDA police,” says Catherine Klapperich, director of the Laboratory for Diagnostics and Global Healthcare Technologies at Boston University. “That’s how Theranos was able to go on, and on, and on. It’s not like there’s someone patrolling, checking in on everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eIIwHj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There aren’t really FDA police”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2z4Op"&gt;So the companies selling lab-developed tests have a lot of leeway around what they’re able to say in their marketing materials. They can’t lie about what their tests can accomplish — which is what Theranos allegedly was doing when it said it could run hundreds of tests on a single drop of blood. But they’re free to say that a test was proven to work (even if that statement was only based on a very small study) or that it passed muster with the FDA (even if that just means the company stuck to the FDA lab-developed test framework). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRuhsu"&gt;“You can say, ‘I’ve followed every single piece of the regulations,’ and you might well be telling the truth. It’s just that the regulatory framework is so weak that it means virtually nothing,” Rutschman says. “But you’re free to go to a customer and say that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z3bwdO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Trust but verify’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Vv7Oue"&gt;In part, the flexibility around lab-developed tests comes because taking a dangerous medication could do more immediate harm than inaccurate or misleading tests. (In the Holmes trial, several doctors testified they were immediately skeptical of weird Theranos results and ordered new tests.) Doctors review tests before they prescribe medications, and they might do additional screening after getting a single concerning result. “If you’ve got a really abnormal result, you’re probably following up with the physician anyway,” Geranche says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSYI4E"&gt;But bad tests aren’t &lt;em&gt;harmless&lt;/em&gt;. They can cause stress and anxiety or give someone false reassurance that they don’t have a problem. Jurors in the Holmes trial &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-elizabeth-holmes-trial-patients-describe-alarming-test-results-11637272480"&gt;heard from patients&lt;/a&gt; who had incorrect test results from Theranos, including Erin Tompkins, whose Theranos test showed that she had an HIV antibody despite never having an HIV or AIDS diagnosis before. Brittany Gould appeared to fight back tears as she testified she’d been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy"&gt;wrongly told by a Theranos test&lt;/a&gt; she was miscarrying her pregnancy — which would have been her &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; miscarriage in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKVGvY"&gt;A test that purports to tell someone that they have serious conditions like cancer, for example, could trigger expensive treatments or drastic life changes. “That really should not be marketed to consumers,” says Mike White, a genetics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. “You should have some physician judgement involved.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0041Ou"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s buyer beware”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="05MQqa"&gt;Because lab-developed tests receive no oversight from the FDA, patients are left to sort out for themselves how reliable the tests are. “It’s buyer beware,” Grenache says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uaE8d"&gt;But most buyers don’t have the resources or background to suss out tests’ reliability. They may not even know that the test they’re getting is lab-developed. That’s why Rutschman thinks there should be more explicit warnings on packaging and advertisements for lab-developed tests saying that they could come with some risks — similar to warnings on tobacco packaging. “I think that if somebody’s getting one of these tests to find out whether they’ve had a miscarriage, or for a cancer screening or something like that, it could give you some pause,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa9vEV"&gt;The Theranos advertising gave no indication that the tests the company was making hadn’t gone through the FDA approval process, and so hadn’t submitted data on their performance to the agency for review. There would have been no reason to think that there’s any difference between the oversight of its blood tests and others that were FDA approved. That’s the case with companies like Everlywell, too — its test information pages just say that the tests are run in certified labs, which most people likely wouldn’t realize is a signal those tests have a lower level of oversight. The company discloses that its tests are lab-developed tests in the &lt;a href="https://support.everlywell.com/article/58-how-does-everlywell-validate-the-reliability-credibility-of-your-labs"&gt;FAQ section&lt;/a&gt; of the website, but it doesn’t give any explanation of what that means.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HjT02Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;experts don’t think the option for labs to go this route should be eliminated entirely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RkmkLs"&gt;Again, a test that’s lab-developed isn’t automatically a bad test. And experts don’t think the option for labs to go this route should be eliminated entirely — they can be useful. But the Theranos case is a clear example of how companies looking to cut corners can take advantage of the system. There isn’t much preventing them from throwing up a slick website for an in-house product that’s only been tested on 15 people. And the people who click through to that slick website may not know that they should dig deeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Ez9p6B"&gt;“It all goes back to how much trust you’re going to have in a company that’s putting its name and reputation out there to do the right thing,” Grenache says. “I would trust but verify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMV3Be"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PT2pC2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VzHAl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPWcl3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqfpzM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RwE26E"&gt;Security isn’t just about passwords and databases. It cuts down to the most basic questions of what we need to protect ourselves and the people we care about. So this week, we’re bringing you stories about how people protect themselves in the most extreme conditions — whether it’s Muslims navigating FBI surveillance or refugees trying to secure a working SIM card. There’s fun stuff too, like TikTok teens solving a mysterious car crash, but the overall message is clear: it’s rough out there, and you’ll need every trick you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofxZY4"&gt;Still, it’s not all bad news. We’ll also be showing you some of our best advice on how to navigate your online life — whether it’s recovering your hacked Facebook account or hiding your email from data brokers. This isn’t quite as glamorous as fighting off ransomware, but we’re betting you’ll find it a whole lot more useful. These aren’t the skills you’ll need when things get serious, but they’re the kind of skills you need right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toshiba’s new 4K Fire TVs might beat out Amazon’s on picture quality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e18FtKfhGwC8FOEZgtNjSevenUU=/0x7:2687x1798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234357/5BD114DD_2731_4221_9DC1_64B368AD1A62.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Toshiba&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6geeH2"&gt;One of Amazon’s Fire TV partners just announced a new model that might outshine the tech giant’s own self-branded TVs that launched only weeks ago. Today Toshiba is introducing the first Fire TV 4K TVs to feature local dimming, a backlight technology that produces improved contrast and black levels compared to the direct LED method used by cheaper sets and Amazon’s new Fire TV Omni series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CquKrK"&gt;Toshiba says the new M-Series contains “up to 48” dimming zones. The TV comes in 55, 65, and 75-inch screen sizes. So assuming that 48 number applies to the biggest model, it’s not exactly going to compete with high-end Vizios or TCLs, which pack more dimming zones into their backlighting systems, but it should still make for a significant improvement to overall picture quality. Despite including features like Dolby Vision on its largest-size Omni sets, Amazon didn’t built full-array local dimming into the devices. As the name suggests, local dimming allows the backlight to illuminate and dim at different areas of the display based on the content, so dark scenes appear the way they should without everything looking gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVkRkv"&gt;The new M-Series Fire TVs from Toshiba also have a “120Hz native panel,” so I’ve asked whether this means they’ll indeed support more fluid gaming from the Xbox Series X, S, and PS5. The TVs will go on sale this month at Best Buy retail stores for $799.99 (55-inch), $999.99 (65-inch), or $1,199.99 (75-inch). One thing Toshiba’s sets share in common with the Omni line is that both have embedded microphones for hands-free Alexa voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVfazK"&gt;Compared to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa"&gt;aggressively-priced Omni line&lt;/a&gt;, you’re definitely paying more for the “flagship” local dimming feature; a 65-inch Omni TV usually goes for $829.99, for example. Still, it’s good to see these improvements coming for TVs with Amazon’s software built in. As more sets with local dimming (and eventually maybe even Mini LED) are released, TCL’s higher-end Roku and Google TV sets might finally start to get some real competition from the other side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6Y34G"&gt;There’s obviously more to a TV than its backlighting, so I look forward to seeing a Toshiba M550KU TV in person to gauge where the overall viewing experience ranks for the price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to hide your email from data collectors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5vhCl8EkWf647Uvjj0ykfT8Hjw=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234353/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_hide.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Preventing spam and tracking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="xDVSsO"&gt;Nowadays, it seems like everyone on the web wants your email. When you give your email address to a site in order to log in or just get some info, many companies will take that as a free pass to do anything from relentlessly spamming you with newsletters to selling your email address to advertisers, who will in turn track you relentlessly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE4nzG"&gt;Thankfully, there are also people building tools that can make things harder for the companies trying to get your email address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2Xnwz"&gt;There are two ways you can keep your real email address more private in different situations: relay services and temporary inboxes. By the time we’re done, you’ll hopefully be able to fill in fields asking for your email without worrying about who’s getting your “real” digital address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="te8KCq"&gt;Email relay services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WgI909"&gt;One way to keep your email address private and keep spam out of your inbox is by using an email relay service. The basic concept behind these services is that they generate a “virtual” email address you can give to apps and websites; any emails sent to that address will automatically get forwarded to your real inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MyWIX"&gt;Many of these services will let you create and manage multiple aliases — for example, you could have one alias for all your newsletters, and another that you give out to shopping sites. With services that allow unlimited aliases, there’s nothing to stop you from creating a new one every time you give your email to a company, if you really want to make it difficult to aggregate your email presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="sIsJGz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZPPMN"&gt;Another common feature these services provide is letting you turn off email forwarding, so that you won’t get any spam or other email from that site. Using our previous example, you could turn off forwarding when you use your shopping sites alias, keeping any tempting sales out of your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6dzyy"&gt;There’s no shortage of these relay services available, but we’ve rounded up a sampling of them that are either built into tools you may already have available, or that are well-regarded platform agnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6IoK1l"&gt;Apple’s Hide My Email / Sign In With Apple&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxfduQ"&gt;If you use Apple devices, the company includes an email relay service called Hide My Email with its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318"&gt;paid iCloud Plus plans&lt;/a&gt;. If you have iCloud Plus and are using an Apple device, you should see a “Hide My Email” option pop up when you select the email field on a website’s signup page. Selecting the option will auto-generate a private email address for you, which will then be forwarded to the email address you use for your Apple account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BNFs5RgBtUC3VWJc8-Qw9fV47bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029220/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_18.17.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s iCloud Plus plans include an email forwarding service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="La38hT"&gt;You can also create a private email address outside of the signup process if you want to use it on a signup form for, say, a game console or an app on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9w9cj"&gt;To do so using your iPhone or iPad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zwYO5a"&gt;Go to Settings and tap your name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="STfb6b"&gt;Go to iCloud &amp;gt; Hide My Email &amp;gt; Create New Address. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="xOHzaY"&gt;On a Mac: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zJHpdB"&gt;Go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ghMnro"&gt;Select iCloud from the sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mPVG2x"&gt;Click Options next to Hide My Email &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="twheUo"&gt;You can add a label and notes to help you remember what the address is for, and you can manage your existing email aliases from the Hide My Email screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1TlLbzI5xiXff-za_tQIRc1BcE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034814/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_09.21.12.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes can help you remember what you’re using the alias for, making it easier to manage multiple ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fvcpZK"&gt;While Hide My Email is only available via the paid iCloud Plus plan, you can also use a form of it for free with Apple’s Sign In with Apple service. On supported sites, you’ll see a Sign In with Apple button, which lets you use your Apple ID to set up and log into accounts. If you use Sign In, Apple also lets you hide your email address from the actual site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIUFex"&gt;To take advantage of this, when you’re setting up your account using Apple’s UI (it will pop up after hitting the “Continue with Apple” button that supported sites use), select the Hide My Email option instead of the Share My Email option. This will more or less work the same way as the paid service — Apple will give the website a randomly generated email address, and forward any email sent to it to the address associated with your Apple ID. Since you’ll be logging in using the Continue With Apple button, you won’t have to keep track of the private email address Apple generates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/305uez6zEoDPAGP69Q8KpTsrcPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029230/IMG_C7400B86A4E2_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Checking the Hide My Email option will have Apple forward you emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n7tFjO"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210426"&gt;manage the email settings for apps and services&lt;/a&gt; you use with Sign In with Apple from either a mobile device or a desktop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mtxcR"&gt;To do so using iOS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QH0H3B"&gt;Go to Settings and tap your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lQpFme"&gt;Go to Password and Security &amp;gt; Apps Using Apple ID. (If you have iCloud Plus, go instead to iCloud &amp;gt; Hide My Email.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EgoTnT"&gt;To stop receiving emails from a service, tap its name, then turn off the Forward To toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="md3MIr"&gt;If you have iCloud Plus, this process will look slightly different. On iOS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yQAf7r"&gt;Go to Settings and tap your name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X4mZaO"&gt;Go to iCloud &amp;gt; Hide My Email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ArnfYK"&gt;To stop receiving emails from a service, tap the service’s name and turn off the Forward To toggle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7ZnN6uleqdizg2NsuQjMW-Pnxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23037705/Screen_Shot_2021_11_23_at_09.31.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning off email forwarding can be done on the Mac or iOS devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yhc9nZ"&gt;On a Mac, the process is the same whether or not you pay for iCloud Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GSymut"&gt;Go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0bOaoA"&gt;Select Password and Security from the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AONsbf"&gt;Click the Edit button next to Apps Using Apple ID, and select the app you want to change settings on from the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iuNYCm"&gt;If you’re using email forwarding, there will be a button labeled “Turn Off” in the Forward To section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FCpiiQ"&gt;You can also manage your email settings on the web by going to &lt;a href="http://appleid.apple.com"&gt;appleid.apple.com&lt;/a&gt;, clicking Sign In with Apple, selecting the app you want to manage, and clicking the Manage Settings button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="o7TjeI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://relay.firefox.com/"&gt;Firefox Relay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UCU1dhRjQghKwG9ftcBRDFJFPxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029844/Screen_Shot_2021_11_20_at_00.22.07.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox Relay may not be the most feature-rich option, but that makes it very easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o3hQLI"&gt;Firefox Relay is an alias service made by Mozilla, the same company behind the popular web browser. With the Firefox Relay extension installed in your Firefox browser, you get a button that’ll show up in email fields, letting you automatically generate an alias. The extension also provides a quick link to a settings page you can use to manage your aliases: turning them off or on, renaming them, or deleting them outright. You can also use the settings page to generate a new alias a la carte, and can access the page to view and manage your aliases on other browsers if you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeI2c4"&gt;One of the obvious advantages (assuming you’re a Firefox user) of Relay is that it’s tied to your Firefox account — that way, you can sign in once when you’re setting up a new device and get all your bookmarks, preferences, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325316/mozilla-vpn-android-windows-launch-firefox-private-network-price"&gt;VPN service&lt;/a&gt;, and email relay controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9onHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Relay’s free tier only allows five aliases&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XuzQgI"&gt;Unfortunately, its free tier is very limited — you can only have up to five aliases, so you’d very likely be using each alias as a category (shopping, social, etc) rather than assigning individual sites their own alias. You also can’t reply to the emails the service forwards to you using the free tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td7V6X"&gt;Mozilla has recently introduced a 99-cent-per-month premium tier, which lets you create as many aliases as you want, and reply to forwarded emails that are less than three months old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YX3a9m"&gt;You can read Firefox’s &lt;a href="https://relay.firefox.com/faq"&gt;FAQ about the service here&lt;/a&gt;. While Relay is not as feature-rich as the next service we’ll cover, it is by far one of the simplest options (if you’re a Firefox user, of course). Installing the extension is as simple as going to its page on the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-relay/"&gt;Firefox add-on store&lt;/a&gt; and clicking install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="F7z8Ks"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anonaddy.com/"&gt;AnonAddy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSZF43kCNuk6zYIrCAxHoWqqSOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029836/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_23.47.14.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnonAddy has a clean, simple dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iofayk"&gt;AnonAddy is a web-based forwarding service that you can use with any device or browser. The free tier lets you create unlimited aliases and manage them however you need — you can deactivate an alias associated with any sites whose emails’ unsubscribe button doesn’t seem to do its job (or doesn’t exist at all), and enjoy not being bombarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVYqig"&gt;A standout feature of AnonAddy is that you can have emails for a specific alias forward to multiple addresses (up to two using the free tier). This could be useful if, for example, you wanted to create a “bills” alias that you use for subscription services, and whose emails get sent to both you and a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qp17lS90gP42h3OdjqqXK4kTSkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029835/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_23.46.09.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnonAddy puts a useful header above forwarded messages. You even get a link to deactivate the alias if you’re getting too much spam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AGnrxt"&gt;The free version of AnonAddy probably isn’t the best option if you expect to be getting a lot of media-heavy emails sent to your aliases — it has a 10MB a month limit, which is generous for text but could be eaten up quickly by pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbs4dh"&gt;AnonAddy has browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome-based browsers like Edge, Brave, and obviously Chrome (though sadly, it doesn’t offer one for Safari).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSajSZ"&gt;If you’ve got a lot of technical skill, you can also &lt;a href="https://anonaddy.com/self-hosting/"&gt;self-host AnonAddy&lt;/a&gt; on your own server. If you want to use an email aliasing system, but don’t want your emails being handled by someone else (or don’t want to pay a $1 per month fee for a 50MB bandwidth cap, or a $3 per month fee for unlimited data), the fact that you can roll your own AnonAddy instance makes it worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4cFiwS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://simplelogin.io/"&gt;SimpleLogin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l05W_IyAFGOBUog8LExXbghsUhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029842/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_23.57.17.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add a SimpleLogin alias with a single click of a button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zu6WZT"&gt;SimpleLogin is another project similar to AnonAddy, though there are different tradeoffs; for example, you get unlimited bandwidth with the free tier, but can only have up to 15 aliases. While it doesn’t have an easy way to replicate the multi-delivery setting of AnonAddy, it’s got tons of settings you can change, so if you’ve got very particular needs it may be the way to go. You can also self-host it, if you’re technically able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgk7FD"&gt;SimpleLogin also has iOS and Android apps for managing your aliases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lmemwl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/"&gt;DuckDuckGo Email Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqUK0DE73RxXDcmAnucRc-yt6IQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22764461/Email_Banner___static.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DuckDuckGo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DuckDuckGo’s email protection service is still in beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NDfH4B"&gt;DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search provider, also has its own email relay service that you can set up using its mobile app. In addition to giving you an adorable “@duck.com” email address to use as an alias, the company also promises that its service will strip out trackers embedded in any emails it’s forwarding you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMDlW9"&gt;We have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22609841/duckduckgo-email-spam-prevent-trackers-how-to"&gt;a separate guide on how to use the service&lt;/a&gt;, but before you click over to it there are a few caveats to note. Email Protection is still in beta, so you might not want to use it for absolutely critical emails just yet. It’s also got a waitlist to join (DuckDuckGo says the wait time is “less than a month”), so it may not be the best option if you’re looking to start on this journey right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8cW3C1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698013/1password-hide-my-email-feature-fastmail-integration"&gt;1Password and Fastmail’s Masked Email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KHh3Z2"&gt;If you subscribe to both 1Password and Fastmail, you can use your password manager to easily create new aliases using Fastmail’s built-in Masked Email feature. To start, go to Fastmail’s website and log in to your account. Then go to Settings and select Masked Email from the Account section in the sidebar. If you don’t use 1Password, you can use this screen to set up an alias (and manage existing ones) by clicking the New Masked Email Address button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqAl0O"&gt;To set up 1Password integration, click the Connect to 1Password button in Fastmail, and log into your account. You’ll then get prompts from both 1Password and Fastmail, asking you to confirm that you want your accounts connected, and you may need to enter your 1Password password one last time. Then your accounts will be linked, and the 1Password browser extension should start letting you create masked emails when you’re on a site’s signup page — unless you use Safari, but we’ll touch on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k8hFfwrIyHoMDREhM_Y-_O3qgI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040565/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_09.30.36.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking Create Masked Email will give you a popup showing the generated address.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WxxHXW"&gt;Now, clicking the Create Masked Email button in your browser’s iPassword extension will generate an alias for you. You can then click the “Fill Email” button to plug it into the signup form you’re filling out. Of course, 1Password will offer to save the login to your password manager, and generate a random password for your new account as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmJoOC"&gt;Unfortunately, this experience is a bit murky for Safari users. The 1Password app in the App Store includes a Safari extension, but it’s different from the one you’ll find for other browsers like Firefox and Chrome. Currently, it doesn’t support the Masked Email feature. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GJmxPP7dLEd2IyE4gS-p3nCE6pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040689/Screen_Shot_2021_11_24_at_10.01.34.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The default 1Password Safari extension doesn’t support Masked Email, but the alternate extension has some serious drawbacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbbfcG"&gt;You can, however, download the separate &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/1password-for-safari/id1569813296?mt=12"&gt;1Password for Safari extension&lt;/a&gt; from the Mac App Store. After installing it, you’ll have to enable it by going to Safari &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Extensions and checking the box next to 1Password for Safari (and unchecking the box next to regular 1Password, or else they’ll fight). This method does have some serious drawbacks; 1Password for Safari doesn’t integrate with the current Mac desktop app, so you can’t unlock it with Touch ID. 1Password &lt;a href="https://1password.community/discussion/123766/trying-to-make-masked-email-work"&gt;says this should be changing in the future&lt;/a&gt;, but for right now you may just want to go with another solution if you use Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="py07wj"&gt;Use a temporary burner email&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5umNBCM-OWfRITStq9EM2s5I_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23029068/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_17.16.50.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Temporary email services are good for situations where you only need to receive an email from a sender once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nZUxDW"&gt;There are some times when you really only need to receive an email or two from a site — say, it wants to send you a confirmation code, or it stubbornly insists that you enter your email to get results instead of just showing them to you. In those cases, instead of spinning up an entire new alias, you could use a temporary email service like &lt;a href="http://guerrillamail.com/"&gt;GuerrillaMail&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://temp-mail.org/en/"&gt;TempMail&lt;/a&gt;. These services do what they say on the tin — provide you with a temporary email address that you can use to receive one or two messages, and then never think about again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxjnY4"&gt;In my experience, some sites may try to keep you from using a temporary email address, saying that they’re invalid. Usually that’s not a great sign, but you can sometimes get around it by trying a different service — if the signup form blocks &lt;a href="https://10minutemail.com"&gt;10MinuteMail&lt;/a&gt;, you could try &lt;a href="https://www.emailondeck.com"&gt;EmailOnDeck&lt;/a&gt;, or vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNS8Q7"&gt;While these methods are helpful for new services, if you want to keep people who already have your email address from tracking you, you can check out our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22288190/email-pixel-trackers-how-to-stop-images-automatic-download"&gt;guide to blocking tracking pixels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxugWE"&gt;We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt;also written before&lt;/a&gt; about Gmail’s built-in alias-like system, where you can give companies your Gmail address with a plus sign and ID tacked onto the end; something like “MyEmailAddress+amazonaccount@gmail.com.” The emails will still show up in your MyEmailAddress inbox, and it could make it more difficult for hackers that obtain one of your logins to guess others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lMyOSg"&gt;However, we wouldn’t recommend it if you’re concerned about privacy. While it could currently help prevent companies from automatically aggregating your footprint, you are still giving them your base email address — it would be trivial to have tracking systems filter out the plus symbol and extra info after it, if enough people start using this trick. Thankfully, plenty of the options above should help you get some email privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite campaign review: playing the hits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9_NA-FasuoM3TpfsaUiMAiTaWs=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234298/HaloInfinite_Campaign01_3840x2160_WM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Infinite in name, not quite yet in scope&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ufl18l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign has been a long time coming, and yet it’s been hard to know what to expect from it. Developer 343 Industries has described &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;as “the start of our platform for the future” and “the start of the next 10 years for &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;.” But after a notoriously poor demonstration last year prompted a delay into this one, Microsoft has shown very little of what’s intended to be a crucial entry in its best-known series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcYo0j"&gt;At the same time, the multiplayer portion of the game has already been released for free. You’ll be able to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign on Game Pass, sure, but this was already a series where interest heavily skewed toward multiplayer, and now the only part of the game Microsoft is directly charging for is the single-player mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9OQYM"&gt;What, exactly, are you getting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGuS1T"&gt;It turns out the answer is… pretty much another &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; campaign. It’s clear that 343 is using &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; as a soft reboot in an attempt to bring the series back to broader relevance, and it features the most radical changes to the core &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; design since the original game. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is almost explicitly a throwback to the series’ earlier days — it feels like it was designed to win back people turned off by the aesthetic and narrative left turns of 343’s &lt;em&gt;Halo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzQ5S4LIaYOpJN9VNXTs093A_44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066589/hi_mar_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAPUR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; begins in an uncharacteristic situation for the series’ iconic protagonist Master Chief: defeat. Floating in space after an encounter with a leader of the Banished — essentially a coalition of bad guys from alien races found in the early &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games — he’s picked up by an unsuspecting pilot and ends up exploring an uncharted &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ringworld in an effort to gain ground and fight back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="usrlZY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s easy to get the sense that ‘Halo’ is back to its best&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5y8QnC"&gt;Despite appearances, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is not really an open-world game. At certain points in the campaign, you do have a lot of freedom to roam Zeta Halo, the new ring, and there are side quests dotted around the map. You can discover items that let you upgrade your equipment, and various optional actions in the world earn you “valor” that can be used to call in for reinforcements. But these moments are sectioned off by the story, and there’s no sense of a singular world that you ever get to explore. Zeta Halo feels more like the incidental hub areas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848867/gears-5-review-pc-xbox-one-release-date"&gt;introduced in &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than a genuinely open game, and there’s very little visual diversity. Like the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, you will also spend a lot of your time roving around neon blue underground corridors fighting endless waves of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8If7Q6"&gt;To be clear, this isn’t a big problem, because &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; plays incredibly well. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; never needed an open world to give you a sense of freedom and creativity with its combat, and that’s even more true with &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. The addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22789035/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;the Grappleshot&lt;/a&gt;, a grappling hook tool that lets you zip around the environments with abandon, is transformative and brings&lt;em&gt; Halo&lt;/em&gt; right up to date with more recent first-person shooters that prioritize the joy of movement. And the more open design, at least for missions situated outside, gives you plenty of freedom to approach them the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuX8AS"&gt;There’s a mission called “The Sequence” midway through the game that’s the perfect example. Ultimately, it’s a simple design — you need to activate four separate buildings to get access to the one you’re coming from. But they’re all several kilometers away from each other, and you have to improvise how to get there. In my case, that meant hijacking various vehicles and getting back to my starting point in a Banshee, a small alien flying craft that was close to exploding. At its highest moments, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; evokes and elevates the blueprint set by classic missions like “The Silent Cartographer” to a whole new level of freedom. Combined with a colorful art style and environmental design more reminiscent of the earlier games, it’s easy to get the sense that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; is back to its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sL0qZ4k7Wb0bpV52dPxm6bzI9ec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066590/hi_mar_8.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zCIZj"&gt;The side quests are essentially just enemy bases with more aliens to shoot, but they do at least give you something to think about when traversing the landscape. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; has always best played to its strengths when its combat opens up to wider environments, and Infinite takes that idea even further, enabling much more flexibility in how you take on your objectives. Unfortunately, too much of the campaign is spent in narrow, repetitive indoor settings. It’s not like the combat isn’t still fun, but frankly these sections can sometimes feel like filler given the promise of how well the game plays outdoors. You will spend far too much time in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; looking for batteries to plug into terminals in order to open doors, which is pretty much all the game ever asks you to do inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vH06Hw"&gt;One of the biggest criticisms of &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign was the repeated boss battles against the Warden Eternal, which felt punishing and tedious. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; has a lot of boss fights, but it feels like 343 put in serious effort to make them more interesting than &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt;’s. The battles are well-designed and often require you to make use of recently unlocked abilities or weapons, which is a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2pqTG"&gt;But Infinite can’t fully escape &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; in other areas. While the narrative is seemingly designed to bring in players less familiar with &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s complex lore by shaking up the setting, the fallout from the previous game’s big twist ultimately ends up driving the plot, and that’s where &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; loses me. This is by no means a game where you have to care about the story in order to enjoy it, but even as a fan of the series myself, it does feel like it was written more for die-hards than newcomers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VbRsuY6zJmg7dAhNIV8TBwAE7n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23066591/HaloInfinite_Campaign04_3840x2160_WM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qHAzwA"&gt;That’s the thing about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the best &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; has been in a long time, but it could easily have been called &lt;em&gt;Halo 6&lt;/em&gt;. There are clear possibilities for potential expansion down the line, of course, and what’s already here will be very replayable. (It’s worth noting here that the campaign won’t be playable in co-op until at least May next year). I do plan on getting around to the side quests I didn’t finish before, which should at least be more of a varied experience than running through “The Silent Cartographer” for the 300th time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk5HHW"&gt;But while there’s a lot to this &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, its scope is far from infinite. This isn’t really a game like &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; where even though it was lacking in content at launch, I’d still feel that urge to replay missions and grind endlessly to make progress. It’s also not a huge open-world game that will take dozens of hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="yEsdBb"&gt;343 Industries has laid some really solid groundwork here and deserves a lot of credit for managing to modernize the series while focusing on what people loved most about it. At this point, though, it’s not so much a reinvention as simply a very good &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54LR6f"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;’s campaign will be available on Wednesday, December 8th for Xbox One consoles, Xbox Series consoles, Windows, and Steam. Microsoft provided &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;with early access to the campaign for review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok drama channels are turning into online intelligence agents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vvW2xd6Wtp8jemxi4pQk8xE31hw=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234248/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Investigate.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new class of creators is using OSINT techniques to solve online mysteries&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="J0o9gb"&gt;In October, a TikTok user named Matthew Heller posted a video recorded moments after a small traffic accident at a Florida intersection. In the video, a woman named Maddy Gilsoul comes up to the window of Heller’s car and starts screaming at him. Heller captioned the video, “I got hit from behind. My car was hit from behind while I was stopped. #lamborghini #aventador #hornblasters.” The original video has since been deleted from TikTok, but Heller left a version of it up &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUnGM4gKjwd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;on his Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnpyQa"&gt;In a world without TikTok, the incident would have remained a small but contentious traffic accident, the fault of which would have been determined by insurance companies. Instead, thousands of users on the shortform video app argued about who was to blame. Was it Gilsoul, who, according to Heller’s video, seemed to have clearly clipped the back of Heller’s Lamborghini? Or was Heller at fault? At one point in the “news cycle,” TikTok users accused him of “gaslighting” them, after new footage surfaced from a nearby security camera that seemed to show him hitting Gilsoul first. Or was this incident even real? Heller appeared to be the founder of a company called &lt;a href="https://hornblasters.com/"&gt;HornBlasters&lt;/a&gt;, which sells custom car horns. A car horn salesman suddenly finds himself at the center of a viral traffic accident? It all seemed too perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="hVgKrx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10905004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GolGwj"&gt;As the numbers on Heller’s video began to climb into the millions, TikTok’s army of commentators rushed into the trending topic to debate and analyze what was happening. A TikToker named @ugolord, who calls himself “The TikTok Attorney,” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ugolord/video/7016060242303683846"&gt;asked his followers&lt;/a&gt; to watch the footage of the accident and decide who was liable. A user named @pushpeksidhu from Toronto &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pushpeksidhu/video/7015995807971216646"&gt;posted an update&lt;/a&gt; on the accident that was watched half a million times, sharing footage from Gilsoul’s account that users hadn’t seen yet, seemingly proving Heller was at fault. A user who goes by @doctor.ryan &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctor.ryan/video/7015897477412932869"&gt;made another video&lt;/a&gt; combining Heller’s account with the new security camera footage for a definitive look at the whole scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVwV21"&gt;Drama-reaction accounts like these are riding a huge wave of popularity right now, thanks to an obsession within the TikTok community with investigating, analyzing, and passing judgment on the content going viral on the platform. The app’s young users pore over random trending videos, constructing elaborate conspiracy theories and even doxxing the people featured in them. Most often, these campaigns to unmask other users are driven by some sense of justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YXza9S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A teenage version of the OSINT community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2OBdG"&gt;In each of these instances, the app’s aggressive recommendation algorithm awakens, pushing the controversies to millions of users, generating hundreds of videos, thousands of comments, and too many views to count. The app has become home to a teenage version of the OSINT (or “open source intelligence”) community, made famous by outlets like the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFR Lab) or investigative site &lt;em&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U2ANw"&gt;The biggest account weighing in on the “Lambo crash” trending topic was @TizzyEnt, an account with 3.8 million followers run by a film director named Michael Mc. During the course of the Lamborghini content cycle, Mc posted several updates, at one point even &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;item_id=7016417722649087238&amp;amp;lang=en#/@tizzyent/video/7016417722649087238"&gt;connecting with Heller&lt;/a&gt; and sharing additional details about what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGwPt"&gt;If you’re on TikTok, you’ve no doubt seen Mc’s videos. On an app defined by permanently teenage Hype House dancers, Mc’s graying beard and low baritone voice definitely stand out, as does his presentation style. He specializes in what right-wingers might call “cancel culture” or what mainstream journalists might call “internet drama.” He’s part of a network of popular TikTok users who have risen to prominence thanks to the TikTok community’s current fixation on crowdsourced investigations into matters both real and conspiratorial or imaginary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37RuA5"&gt;Mc and his collaborators unmask racists, report anti-vax nurses to their respective hospitals, and help “cancel” members of TikTok’s rogues’ gallery of conspiracy theory truthers, fascists, and viral main characters. But with a massive young audience hungry for accountability, or more accurately, viral justice, these TikTokers are finding there is a fine line between citizen journalism and vigilante information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ytL7hz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mc and Paterno spent days locked in a feud, dueting videos with each other&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7gi4ow"&gt;In the case of the Lamborghini saga, TikTok users drew lines and took the side of either Heller or Gilsoul, flooding their accounts with nasty comments. Heller’s TikTok account is no longer active and Gilsoul hasn’t posted since October. But this kind of work can get much more intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbyC9Y"&gt;Shortly before Mc waded into the Lamborghini drama, he &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7011258812845788421?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;led a campaign&lt;/a&gt; against a FedEx delivery driver named Vincent Paterno, who claimed in a TikTok video that he would not deliver packages to any homes without an American flag or with a Biden/Harris sign in the front yard. Mc posted Paterno’s Facebook page on TikTok and said he would be reporting him to FedEx. Then Mc and Paterno spent days locked in a feud, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7011657306534399237?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;dueting&lt;/a&gt; videos with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS3Ddk"&gt;“You’re such a piece of shit,” Mc says in one video. “Do you know your wife messaged me to tell me how she and her children do not agree with you? How she begged you not to post this? And now you’ve posted a second time — and she’s getting threats, by the way.” Then Mc scolds his own audience for sending threats to Paterno and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UomuRL"&gt;The whole episode ended with Paterno &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/27/fedex-driver-fired-after-not-delivering-to-biden-supporters/"&gt;reportedly getting fired&lt;/a&gt; from FedEx. In a final update, Mc &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7012747260199030021?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;jokingly threatens&lt;/a&gt; to brand “@tizzyent” on Paterno’s back. This kind of content is far from anything you’re going to get on a mainstream media outlet — maybe on Substack — but Mc’s audience can’t get enough of it, flooding his comment section with tips for more video investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WB5c8y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I look at the internet like one giant small town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dmeCOI"&gt;Mc told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he’s trying to bring some accountability back to how people behave on the internet. He isn’t actively trying to get people fired — though he does, and isn’t quiet about it on his account when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37bSqx"&gt;“There’s an old expression that ‘bad gas travels fast in a small town.’ If you live in a small town and you do something terrible, everyone knows about it,” he said. “I look at the internet like one giant small town in the sense of: If I put something out there, my objective is not to get someone fired unless their job is directly harming people. So like a nurse refusing to get vaccinated. She could be infecting people. That’s a thing. Or a police officer harming people. That’s the thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlgQEo"&gt;According to Mc, he started out making videos just trying to debunk misinformation and conspiracy theories that came across his For You page, the central feed where TikTok users see content recommended to them. He said earlier this year, as America began its vaccine rollout, the app became inundated with anti-vax content. In August, a user sent him a video of a woman who went by @antivaxmomma, who was bragging about selling fake vaccination cards on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9MBP5"&gt;“[Users] find someone doing that sort of thing, and they don’t know how to deal with it themselves,” he said. “They reach out to people like me, and go, ‘Hey, can you see what this person is doing? Can you help with this kind of thing?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DGrnHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The algorithm kind of promotes tribalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpaGAx"&gt;Mc and the network of other TikTokers he works with sprang into action, identifying the woman as Jasmine Clifford, who &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-c14ce28edda2593b0b3819acec97089e"&gt;was then charged&lt;/a&gt; by law enforcement with conspiracy, and offering and possession of a forged instrument. According to Mc, his regular collaborators include &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/online-sleuth-danesh-thatdaneshguy-tiktok-anti-vaxxers"&gt;@ThatDaneshGuy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/aunt-karen-white-lives-matter-facebook/"&gt;@auntkaren0&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/she-called-out-health-care-misinfo-tiktok-then-trolls-found-n1265011"&gt;@rx0rcist&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom who have made headlines in the last few months for their flashy videos exposing and publicly shaming various villains within the progressive-leaning world of TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGElj9"&gt;There is a feeling, one Mc shares, among many long-time TikTok users that individual accounts have to step up and personally deal with the app’s rampant misinformation, extremism, and conspiracy theories. As Mc sees it, his account wouldn’t need to exist if TikTok actually moderated its platform properly. “The algorithm kind of promotes tribalism,” he said. “You get inside of the bubble when you start believing that your perspective is the only one that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NYy0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something fundamentally changed in this work about 10 years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qXjSvG"&gt;But the videos these users post are a tightrope walk of investigative journalism, punditry, and open source intelligence that could easily fall into the same trap as Reddit’s libelous and disastrous &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22263020"&gt;r/FindTheBostonBomber experiment&lt;/a&gt;. But according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/etbrooking"&gt;Emerson T. Brooking&lt;/a&gt;, a resident senior fellow at the DFR Lab, we are well past the point where journalistic institutions can decide who can and cannot conduct OSINT research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDHm0A"&gt;“I’m not gonna position myself as a legacy gatekeeper; I think something fundamentally changed in this work about 10 years ago,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You need to use communities and enthusiasm to try to accomplish some good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdSYq9"&gt;Brooking clarified, though, that performing this kind of work out in the open — or at least on an app like TikTok, which has a trending topic-focused algorithm that blurs together responsible TikTokers like Mc and more rogue accounts that are doing it for clout — could easily spin out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2CyNG"&gt;“If you look into how &lt;em&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/em&gt; is structured,” Brooking said, “whether their most famous, prominent analysts have this public presence, they’re doing their work on a Slack channel, actually. They’re not doing every bit of it on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsuWOL"&gt;Making things even more confusing is when large media organizations begin to weigh in on these fairly low-level TikTok dramas. Being the subject of a TikTok spat is one thing, but it’s another to elevate it into a news story and turn a local incident into international headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xsd9J3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think I’m gonna have to start saying in every video, ‘Hey, don’t, don’t threaten them’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qseBdn"&gt;Both Mc and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sophiasgaler"&gt;Sophia Smith Galer&lt;/a&gt;, a London-based senior news reporter for &lt;em&gt;VICE &lt;/em&gt;who also runs a personal TikTok account with over 275,000 followers, said traditional media has a habit of turning the volume up on these minor naming-and-shaming campaigns happening on TikTok. Smith Galer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the media often legitimizes the vigilante justice being carried out by random TikTok users when they turn these viral scandals into news stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWc3fv"&gt;“We saw this with the rush to cover TikTok users investigating the disappearance of Gabby Petito, or the reporting around TikTok users erroneously claiming that a furniture company was somehow trafficking children during the US presidential election,” she said. “TikTok users overanalyzing videos going viral on the app is nothing new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYWfFC"&gt;During Mc’s crusade against Paterno, the FedEx driver, the two men traded barbs across their social media platforms and Mc did share Paterno’s Facebook information and reported Paterno to FedEx. But the ensuing media swarm, kicked off by &lt;a href="https://toofab.com/2021/09/24/fedex-fires-driver-who-refused-to-deliver-to-homes-with-biden-or-camel-toe-harris-flags/"&gt;this article from &lt;em&gt;TooFab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, brought the story to a national stage, eventually getting coverage &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/27/fedex-driver-fired-after-not-delivering-to-biden-supporters/"&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Paterno is still on TikTok, by the way, where he’s now &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vincentmrworldwid/video/7029130139740982574?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;posting anti-vax content&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL0WG7"&gt;But according to Smith Galer, when mainstream media outlets cover these stories, the more responsible users like Mc, the genuinely nefarious bad actors spreading disinformation, and just the random shitposters get swirled together into a trend that typically makes the chaos on TikTok worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJHFTT"&gt;Like Brooking, Smith Galer sees the current wave of amateur OSINT happening on TikTok as a net positive, but also a recipe for chaos. There &lt;a href="https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/#:~:text=U.S.%20Audience%20%E2%80%93%20As%20we%20mentioned,between%20the%20ages%2025%2D44."&gt;are currently&lt;/a&gt; around 80 million active users on TikTok in America, but &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/"&gt;Statista estimates&lt;/a&gt; that roughly a quarter of those users are between ages 10-19. That is a lot of children learning how to doxx each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RewUGY"&gt;“What’s fun about all of these is how they are universalizing OSINT skills, but what is not fun about all of these is the lack of media literacy and the innocence in which content creators commit contempt of court, libel, or spread harmful misinformation,” Smith Galer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPVAGt"&gt;And this is the central dynamic Mc said he’s been struggling with recently. He said he was committed to using his TikTok account to exposing various bad actors, but he has noticed that, regardless of how even-keeled his presentation style is, his followers — or users who find his videos in their For You pages — aren’t as interested in making sure things are done the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tvlBc1"&gt;“I think I’m gonna have to start saying in every video, ‘Hey, don’t, don’t threaten them. No death threats, no violence.’ If you want to write to someone’s employer and say you don’t like what that employee did, that’s your prerogative to do that. But no, you calling an oncology department and saying, ‘I’ll kill all of you’ — I don’t believe that my followers did that,” he said. “But I’m still going to put it out there just in case any of my followers get really upset about something or someone who sees one of my videos.”&lt;/p&gt;
