    <title>Facebook content moderators in Ireland demand work-from-home rights </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syJ48e"&gt;Facebook content moderators in Ireland met with Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar today to demand work-from-home rights. They say the company forced them back into the office, even as COVID-19 cases spiked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6475GP"&gt;“We should be working from home just like employees,” said Ibrahim Halawa, a former political prisoner and law student who works as a Facebook content moderator. “We should have the same mental health care they get, the same benefits—but we don’t. Facebook can’t exist without us, and it should stop treating us as second-class citizens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwnNmX"&gt;Since December 30th, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55493290"&gt;Ireland has been in a level five lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, meaning household visits are banned and nonessential retail businesses are closed. &lt;a href="https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/casesinireland/epidemiologyofcovid-19inireland/COVID19%20Daily%20infographic.pdf"&gt;The country currently has 192,645 confirmed COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEBm1p"&gt;In August, Facebook announced employees would be able to work from home until July 2021. Two months later, content moderators working for the subcontracting firm CPL in Dublin were told to return to the office. The company had categorized them as essential workers, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/23/facebook-moderators-forced-to-work-in-dublin-office-despite-high-tier-lockdown"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. High-risk contractors were exempt, but those with vulnerable family members had to comply. Moderators had previously been told the office would close for 72 hours if there was a confirmed COVID-19 case. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/23/facebook-moderators-forced-to-work-in-dublin-office-despite-high-tier-lockdown"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that after three cases, the office remained open&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ0N1U"&gt;During a press conference today, Halawa said Varadkar agreed to send a letter to Facebook and Covalen, a CPL subsidiary, inquiring about the disparate treatment between contractors and employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQMXwK"&gt;“They’ve made it abundantly clear that our health &amp;amp; safety and lives don’t matter to them,” said Paria Moshfeghi, another Facebook content moderator. “They’re forcing us into the office, putting us and our families at risk of COVID-19, even though our colleagues keep getting COVID. Facebook employees working on the similar content as us are safe and allowed to work from home. Why aren’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F7YJK"&gt;Both Halawa and Moshfeghi stressed that other Facebook moderators want to come forward but are scared because of the strict NDAs workers are forced to sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UImD6Q"&gt;Tech companies have faced mounting pressure to moderate content during the coronavirus pandemic. In March, YouTube announced it would be relying more heavily on AI to enforce its content moderation policy. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448916/youtube-automated-moderation-ai-machine-learning-increased-errors-takedowns"&gt;the company said it was bringing back human moderators&lt;/a&gt;, noting AI hadn’t been as effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tp15zm"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wp9Ac"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0hkmH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deaf people face unique challenges as pandemic drags on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A collage with a purple background, showing four black squares with accessibility symbols on them, including the symbols for open captions, hearing loop, ASL interpreting, and closed captions.

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For many, gaps in communication have only worsened&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AS2QIi"&gt;After spending five days at a mental health hospital in October, Quinn West left feeling as though they hadn’t gained much from their stay. They spent most of their time in their room, finding group therapy pointless because, as a Deaf person, they couldn’t fully participate in conversations. They communicated with hospital staff primarily through writing and lipreading. They repeatedly asked for an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter, but in-person interpretation wasn’t an option because of COVID-19 restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnB8GY"&gt;Although West could use Video Remote Interpretation, they found they couldn’t necessarily rely on it. “[It] is tricky when the room has bad audio quality, the interpreter constantly gets disconnected, and the iPad is not always catching everything happening in the room,” says West. Every new call also means a new interpreter, and having to adjust to a different signing style every time only adds to the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkipcd"&gt;West’s hospital experience is not an outlier. Many deaf and hard of hearing people have been alone in hospitals without consistent ways to communicate with doctors and staff, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nad.org/coronavirus/media-kit/"&gt;National Association of the Deaf&lt;/a&gt; (NAD). For deaf people — in hospitals, at work, in their homes — the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gaps in communication access, from a lack of reliable technology to an underutilization of certain tools when people need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CWA9ul"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Isolation is intensified for deaf people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc7ieY"&gt;“I’ve learned to always be wary when I see [mentions of] accessibility, many times it is faulty or access that isn’t good enough,” says West. While social distancing has been hard on just about everyone, the isolation is intensified for deaf people because their access is so often an afterthought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtfI27"&gt;For many people, face masks were one of the first, most obvious causes of trouble. “Before, I would rely on lipreading and residual hearing to communicate with everyone from cashiers to bank tellers to the dentist and more,” says Beatrice Bachleda, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCak38d7-WkBjzLMAAPBhfQg/featured"&gt;Deaf yoga instructor&lt;/a&gt;. “With masks, I sometimes don’t even realize if anyone is talking to me which can lead to some pretty awkward encounters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLidq8"&gt;As masks became the norm, even people who didn’t realize they had hearing loss noticed they were struggling to understand speech. Around the beginning of the pandemic, audiologists noticed an uptick in patients coming in with concerns about their hearing. People who already had hearing aids were having more difficulty understanding speech, says Catherine Palmer, former president of the &lt;a href="https://www.audiology.org/"&gt;American Academy of Audiology&lt;/a&gt;. People with mild hearing loss, who weren’t previously using hearing aids, suddenly found that they couldn’t understand speech without them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NudvJj"&gt;“Masks create two barriers for individuals with any level of hearing loss,” says Palmer. They reduce visual cues — mouth movement, facial expression — that support communication for people with reduced hearing, while also decreasing the transmission of certain frequencies of sound that lend to clarity of speech.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVsSB"&gt;Some have pointed to masks with transparent windows to make communication easier for people who depend on lipreading and facial expressions. But they’re not widely used, and “the weakness is that it’s not something the deaf person can do or wear; the person we are trying to understand must wear them,” says Jenna Beacom, a Deaf writer and editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lKUWTK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Transparent masks are a difficult trade-off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cF6WyJ"&gt;The materials used in transparent masks also dampen sound more than cloth masks, making for a difficult trade-off for people who use both residual hearing and visual cues to understand speech. The dampening effect is also a problem for people who don’t have hearing loss but struggle with auditory processing, like many autistic people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xys2BD"&gt;Transparent masks aren’t the only imperfect solution. Every deaf person’s needs and preferences are unique, and sometimes one accessibility option isn’t enough. “When I had to get a COVID test I had a hard time understanding over video phone, it would have been easier for me to have someone email me or text me,” says West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSx7Lr"&gt;Some people have been left with very few communication options because of the pandemic. Social distancing is particularly hard to navigate &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/they-are-deaf-and-blind-and-social-distancing-has-now-taken-their-ability-to-touch/2020/04/08/de5a9d42-79ae-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html"&gt;for DeafBlind people&lt;/a&gt; who use tactile ASL, which involves touching hands while signing. In many contexts, including hospital visits, tactile ASL is difficult to accommodate for: video calls aren’t feasible, and COVID-19 restrictions may prevent a family member or friend from assisting with communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hFI9Eg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s sometimes more to do with attitudes rather than the technology itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DrnkA0"&gt;While some accessibility problems are difficult to address even with multiple tools available, in many cases, it comes down to a lack of willingness to use existing technology like video captions and interpreting services. “Over time, I see that technology is slowly catching up,” says Bachleda. “I do wish we could progress a bit faster because there are still lots of gaps though, and it’s sometimes more to do with attitudes rather than the technology itself.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb9nWR"&gt;The proliferation of virtual events and remote work has made some things easier for deaf people, but there are still challenges. Thanks to the move to more online training, Bachleda was able to advance her yoga certification after years of being unable to arrange in-person classes with an interpreter. She says that with online resources she can get “some semblance of access,” but that access has often been limited to auto-captions. “Asking anyone to provide an interpreter is almost always a tough battle,” she says, and she’s been told “no” enough times that she rarely asks anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3yYuw"&gt;“So much is video-based, and so little of what’s video-based is accessible,” says Beacom. She’s been disappointed by many virtual events, which either had no captions or used frequently inaccurate auto-captions, in addition to missing out on family Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s6b6HJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The National Association for the Deaf filed a lawsuit against the White House&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1e9l7a"&gt;The battle for ASL interpretation has been fought all the way to the level of national COVID-19 briefings. In August, the NAD &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/asl-interpreter-lawsuit-coronavirus-trump.html"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the White House after months of briefings with no ASL interpreters. Part of the argument in the White House’s original response was that the briefings included closed captioning and that transcripts were available for each one. But even if live captions are accurate, people whose first language is ASL may not completely understand English. “We have received many complaints from deaf and hard of hearing people unable to understand from the briefings what they are supposed to do or avoid to stay safe and healthy,” says the NAD’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPyHUe"&gt;Because interpretation and captioning on live TV are so often unreliable, many deaf people don’t bother watching news stations. “My local news has had interpreters but sometimes, they cut the interpreter off or graphics and captions will be covering their window and it makes it complicated to view,” says Rikki Poynter, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rikkipoynter"&gt;Deaf YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; and activist. “Obviously, the Trump administration never gave interpreters to begin with so that was a struggle to keep up with if captions were also being wonky at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9HpCtu"&gt;Between struggling with masks and being left out of everything from virtual hang-outs to COVID-19 briefings, many deaf people have found the pandemic taking a serious toll on their mental health. “Life has been much more isolating,” says Poynter. She had already struggled to communicate with people who don’t know ASL, “now everyone is having zoom parties and stuff, but deaf folks tend to be uninvited because we’re not as thought about and the lack of accessibility (small cameras, laggy Internet, etc) make it extremely difficult to take part in any of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision episode 4: Ready, A.I.M., theorize </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3t_KbB798F_OJcRLtcJo9HDUt6U=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68740840/MEX2090_104_comp_v007_r709.00099148.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RKEBN2"&gt;Certain names have popped up again and again over the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232745/wandavision-episode-one-two-recap-theory-sword-shield-age-of-ultron-skrulls"&gt;few episodes of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s one organization we haven’t discussed yet: A.I.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcxLC"&gt;Before diving into this week’s theories, however, let’s take a second to acknowledge just where the show is within the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s timeline. Marvel Studios previously confirmed that &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/984305/9358?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;took place just after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but thanks to a sad revelation about Monica Rambeau’s mom, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251874/captain-marvel-review-marvel-mcu-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson"&gt;Maria Rambeau&lt;/a&gt;, that plays at the beginning of the fourth episode, we know it’s about three weeks since the blip. (Remember, the “blip” is how they referred to Thanos’ great snappening, referencing events that took place in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17276030/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel-iron-man"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqzFDM"&gt;Three weeks is a relatively fresh period for people — especially those who returned to Earth after fading into dust. For Wanda, that’s exactly three weeks since she turned into dust, came back to fight Thanos, and apparently moved to New Jersey to start a new life in a fictional town. The last three episodes have focused entirely on her perspective, but episode 4 introduces — or, rather, &lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt;introduces — a couple of key characters who act like our eyes and ears within Westview, trying to figure out what Wanda’s doing and who’s possibly controlling her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgg9Jb"&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Consider this your warning about inevitable &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;episode 4 spoilers. Turn back now or forever hold your tweets about spoilers.] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMw_-Rnz1j025PAzPZCv9YewiPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268285/MEX2350_104_comp_v009_20201209_r709.1045.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4Xbpk4"&gt;We’ve talked quite a bit about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243271/wandavision-episode-3-recap-explainer-mephisto-agatha-harkness-tommy-billy-sword"&gt;Mephisto in these columns&lt;/a&gt;, a demonic devil who has deep ties to Wanda, Vision, and the greater Marvel universe-at-large. There’s another theory we have to discuss today and, while I think it’s less likely, there are too many possibilities to ignore its potential. I’m so excited I get to write these next few words: let’s go back to &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RitAyU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3 &lt;/em&gt;introduced Marvel Cinematic Universe fans to a company called Advanced Idea Mechanics, better known as A.I.M. Headed by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH_Vr7aVHng"&gt;Guy Pearce’s Aldrich Killian&lt;/a&gt; in the film, A.I.M.’s role in the comics is slightly different, and that’s where a few theories lie. In the comics, A.I.M. is a think tank of sorts belonging to several of the world’s smartest scientists who believe in harnessing and using technology to acquire unspeakable power. There are three specific reasons that some fans believe A.I.M. has ties to &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and, more importantly, suggestions about what those could mean for the show’s big villain reveal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t8ldRm"&gt;The first appearance of a bee suit in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s second episode &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ioPTdN"&gt;Strucker watch &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="drDTWK"&gt;Hexagons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbAJtZ8Ijgz3fnjU7vkqWwIAEuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268290/wandavision_bee.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FC03fp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bees? Beads? Bees!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cqWUSv"&gt;A man in a beekeeping suit emerging out of a sewer in the middle of an empty suburb late at night would be unusual in any world, but in Marvel, bee suits are deeply tied to A.I.M. The organization’s seemingly disposable henchmen are referred to as “beekeper guys,” as our &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2021/1/15/22231577/wandavision-episode-2-easter-eggs-beekeeper-strucker-watch-aim"&gt;sister publication &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. A man emerging out of a sewer to see what’s going on with Wanda inside her own fictional reality could refer to a henchman completing a job for A.I.M. Now, the fourth episode explains his appearance — he’s a man named Franklin — as an agent of S.W.O.R.D. entering Wanda’s prism to try to make contact with the mutant. Hence the S.W.O.R.D. logo on the back of his suit — but why does he appear as a beekeeper in Wanda’s universe? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0XuVz"&gt;As actress Kathryn Hahn recently &lt;a href="https://tvline.com/2021/01/28/wandavision-spoilers-agnes-agatha-harkness-kathryn-hahn/"&gt;said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;TVLine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “there are so many layers” to what’s happening on the show. Agent Franklin could just be a S.W.O.R.D. lackey sent in to try to get in touch with Wanda. But Marvel also has a history of organizations being run by shady figures. That’s where &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s newest character comes in — Tyler Hayward, acting director of S.W.O.R.D. Part of it is my own gut feeling of “I don’t trust him” that comes with being a longtime Marvel fan and still getting unnecessarily angry at the name Alexander Pierce. Something about this guy just seems &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. He’s a Marvel Cinematic Universe original, too, so there’s no comics precedence to inform our hypothesizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFezfc"&gt;Could Hayward be a member of A.I.M.? If so, could A.I.M. be using one of their deadliest creations — the Cosmic Cube — to help warp Wanda’s reality? That’s where one of our other connections that could tie A.I.M. to Wanda’s new world comes in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_8wmWNIiBjyseyK4W4C5M--6Tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268297/strucker_watch.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9zABd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.I.M.? Hydra? What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RoWTVI"&gt;In the second episode, we get a commercial for a fictional product called the Strucker watch. The commercial seemed to incorporate Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, a Hydra sleeper agent within S.H.I.E.L.D. who is seen holding custody of Wanda and her twin brother Pietro in a &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; post-credits&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;scene and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;’s opening battle&lt;/a&gt;. In the comics, Baron von Strucker helped start A.I.M., using it as an organization to create top-secret, dangerous weapons for Hydra during World War II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzYszq"&gt;Coincidence? Maybe, but this is Marvel Studios. Nothing is ever a coincidence. It’s also not like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is trying to shrink away from its Hydra connections. The third episode contains a commercial for Hydra Soak, which is a reference to a blue soap created by the evil organization that is used to place false memories in people’s heads, according to Agent Coulson in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejK6jOzuuyc"&gt;season 4 episode of &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;If A.I.M. and Hydra are involved with warping Wanda’s mind to create a false reality, the only reason to do so is to use Wanda until she can become — or produce — a weapon they need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqdTMU"&gt;Keeping Wanda because of her weapon potential is the same reasoning behind the much more circulated fan theory about Mephisto being the figure behind Wanda’s current self-imprisonment. It’s still my preferred theory, especially considering that Marvel Comics put Mephisto in a splashy promo for the “next big thing” just as &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;started rolling, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaYehl/status/1354630810243002368"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;’s Joshua Yehl&lt;/a&gt; pointed out on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6f6dy"&gt;If Mephisto seems like the most likely candidate for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s big villain reveal (or at least, &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/wandavision-nightmare-villain/"&gt;part of the villain reveal&lt;/a&gt;), it may seem strange that people are still talking about A.I.M. That’s where geometry comes in. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanda’s prism, as rendered in the shape of a hexagon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yz9WzX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hexagons for everyone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pg5ewV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;has an affinity for shapes — specifically hexagons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UD0rYE"&gt;Variations of A.I.M.’s logo have been &lt;a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvels-avengers4475/images/3/39/AIM.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200901133802"&gt;designed in a golden hexagon&lt;/a&gt;. Remember the “beekeeper” reference? Honeycomb also takes the shape of a hexagon. Subtly referring to the shape throughout the series could hint at A.I.M.’s work at play. Hexagons could just be a rad shape that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s team is into but, again, this is Marvel Studios. There are rarely coincidences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KxNZ"&gt;Monica Rambeau wears hexagon-shaped earrings in the show’s third episode, for example. Then the fourth episode 3D renders Wanda’s fake town, which is in the shape of a hexagon. Episodes fade out in the shape of hexagons, not circles traditionally associated with older shows coming to an end. Not to mention that Jimmy Woo basically writes down on his giant whiteboard of clues “what’s going on with these hexagons?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN2Xjg"&gt;The hexagon could be a reference to the number of points on the shape — six — which is also the number of Infinity Stones. (Vision is, of course, effectively powered by the Mind Stone.) Or hexagons could be a subtle play on the prefix hex, a Germanic term that means witchcraft. Wanda is a witch, and we’re pretty sure her neighbor Agnes is really the ancient witch, Agatha Harkness. Or hexagons could allude to the correlation between the number six and the devil (666), which may be a subtle nod to Mephisto. There are a lot of possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PLrWqA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if it is A.I.M.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nFjEJS"&gt;I really don’t think A.I.M. is the big bad, so this is just fun speculation I don’t believe will come true — what if everything is leading up to M.O.D.O.K? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVT6jy"&gt;By now you may be thinking, “Why are there so many acronyms in Marvel names?” Reader, I have the same question. M.O.D.O.K. is pretty nifty, though! M.O.D.O.K, which stands for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, was at one time the leader of A.I.M. He’s the type of guy who can bridge the first few phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the upcoming cosmic phase — not to mention M.O.D.O.K. has deep ties to both the Avengers and X-Men universes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOAVtw"&gt;Part of the reason I’m pretty sure it’s not M.O.D.O.K, other than it not really lining up, is the lack of interaction between he and Wanda. Sure, there’s an &lt;em&gt;Avengers vs. X-Men &lt;/em&gt;moment, but we’re not setting up &lt;em&gt;Avengers vs. X-Men&lt;/em&gt;. At least, not yet. Whether any of this happens — or all of it happens in some capacity — is part of the mystery that makes &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;so fun. As weeks go by, we’ll get a clearer answer of just who’s behind this entire ordeal. Who knows? Maybe it was just Wanda all along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eP9bcJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uwpr3A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix testing a timer feature on Android devices that stops streaming after set period</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qc-okPZkxtQnZ01kWKZcBpFV2r4=/0x2:3600x2402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68740484/BRIDGERTON_102_Unit_02026R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDkb88"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/netflix"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; is launching a global test today on Android devices that will allow subscribers to set a timer for their viewing period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOB8Bp"&gt;The new feature lets people choose between four timer settings: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or end of whatever people are watching. After the selected time limit comes to an end, the Netflix app will stop. This should, in theory, help conserve battery life on Android devices while also ensuring that episodes don’t continue to auto-play. (Fall asleep to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;without worrying about where you left off!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX3K7G"&gt;Although the test is limited to select users globally with Android devices right now, Netflix will explore bringing it to other devices, including TV sets and desktops, depending on how widely the product is adapted and if subscribers seem to like it, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQr1k66GgI-A8AJGE9TRwuqiMVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268248/Netflix_Timer__1_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FoO5R0"&gt;To use the feature, follow the below directions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8YaPLZ"&gt;Choose and play your favorite TV show or movie on your mobile device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5h4RkT"&gt;In the upper right corner, subscribers will see a clock icon that is labeled Timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7UX880"&gt;Tap on Timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Vuxa81"&gt;Select 15, 30, 45 minutes, or “Finish Show.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="9ORHkH"&gt;As of right now, the feature is only available on adult profiles. Although it seems like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163863/netflix-family-profile-kids-activity-report-data-movies-tv-shows-individual"&gt;perfect feature for kids&lt;/a&gt;, especially where screen time is concerned, it’s not available right now. The company could potentially make a version of the feature more applicable for account profiles designed for children in the future. That is dependent on how well the test is received. Instead of simply tapping a clock icon and setting the timer, the feature for kids may need to be a little more difficult to access because kids tend to tap on screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcYVH5"&gt;I personally like to think of it as a sleep tool. If you’re someone like me, who falls asleep watching Netflix or Disney Plus or whatever it may be on their phone, having it turn off when an episode ends is a pretty good feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj77Nw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Friday January 29th, 12:24pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional information from Netflix about which Android users can access the feature. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch the Snyder Cut while snacking on a $130 Justice League-themed meal kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fblMsLljXRnXfpg8nayqjyIiuk=/0x2:4096x2733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68740292/EsqigqvXYAE3PQu.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Wldathome/status/1354073688606470144" target="_blank"&gt;Wonderland / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8AES2e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; — known to fans as the mythical “Snyder Cut” — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255990/justice-league-snyder-cut-hbo-max-release-date"&gt;hits HBO Max on March 18th&lt;/a&gt;, and Warner Bros. is celebrating the at-home blockbuster relaunch in a unique way: with customized, themed $130 Snyder Cut meal boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm4UVk"&gt;Described as “a first-of-its-kind, immersive, at-home dining experience” for customers in the US and the UK, Warner Bros. is teaming up with Wonderland Restaurants (a self-described “creative &amp;amp; innovation studio for the food and beverage industry”) to create the kits. Wonderland Restaurants is also currently working on &lt;a href="https://parkrowlondon.co.uk/"&gt;Park Row&lt;/a&gt;, an upcoming high-end DC Comics-themed restaurant in London that was &lt;a href="https://london.eater.com/2019/2/21/18234407/park-row-new-comic-book-restaurant-london-batman-dc-universe-wonderland-fat-duck-alinea"&gt;announced in early 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1uXco"&gt;The meal kits are designed to resemble the film’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin"&gt;MacGuffin&lt;/a&gt;-y Mother Boxes and cost $130 for a kit for two or $260 for four (shipping and taxes not included). Inside will be a variety of Justice League-adjacent food: the “Ocean Trench” appetizer for Aquaman, consisting of “Icelandic cod and chips with trench dressing” and the “Big Belly Burger” for the Flash, alluding to the &lt;a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Belly_Burger"&gt;fictional DC universe burger joint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2xXCa"&gt;Other menu items that have yet to be revealed include the Superman and cornfield-inspired “Resurrection,” the Wonder Woman-themed “Ancient Themysciran Fire,” and the more mundane “Snack and Extras.” Also included are &lt;a href="https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Koul-Brau_Breweries"&gt;Koul-Brau beers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Jitters"&gt;Jitters cold brew&lt;/a&gt;, which both also allude to in-universe DC brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZM4fXK"&gt;Like any meal kit, some of the items in the Mother Box will be preprepared; others, like the hamburger and fish courses, will need to be cooked at home. Vegetarian options are also available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZD4ieb"&gt;Wonderland says that the Snyder Cut box is intended to just be the start of its immersive boxed meal partnership with Warner Bros., with the company promising that “further boxed dining experiences are planned for 2021 featuring more of the most popular and beloved Warner Bros. franchises.” Given the studio’s plans to release all of its theatrical films day-and-date on HBO Max, it’s possible that the Wonderland could be planning future boxes to tie into those titles much like it is for the Snyder Cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAHFVc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tweaking COVID-19 vaccines will keep them effective against new variants  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-HEALTH-VIRUS-SERUM-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YajFUa66W0HzQufitoc4M2B5VbE=/4x0:4659x3103/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739955/1230726557.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i0PG7i"&gt;Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have cautioned that the first batch of vaccines created against the virus might not be the last. Like all viruses, this one &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/16/opinion/coronavirus-mutations-vaccine-covid.html"&gt;would mutate&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually, those mutations could make the virus different enough that a different vaccine would be needed to combat it. Only two months into the vaccination campaign, researchers are preparing for that inevitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57k2pR"&gt;There’s early evidence from South Africa that both the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/novavax-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-90-effective-but-far-less-so-against-one-variant/"&gt;Novavax&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;Johnson and Johnson&lt;/a&gt; vaccine candidates are not as effective against a variant form of the virus first identified in the country, called B.1.351. The shots still offer some defense and still protect against hospitalization and death. Preliminary research indicates that the COVID-19 vaccines already authorized in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech, will also still block this variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94C77m"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/south-carolina-first-cases-of-south-africa-variant/"&gt;first known&lt;/a&gt; cases of infection with this strain were reported in the US this week. And even though its vaccine does appear to be partially effective against the variant, pharmaceutical company Moderna announced this week that it’s starting work on another version of its COVID-19 vaccine. It’ll be more specifically targeted at B.1.351. It’s a good move based on what researchers know so far, says Dylan Morris, who studies viral evolution at the University of California, Los Angeles. “I’d say that it’s prudent, rather than an emergency,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zg382T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many assumed Covid mutations would partially escape vaccines. In vitro evidence already suggested that. What we now see is that the vaccines may still afford measurable, albeit reduced protection. We now need regulatory process to allow efficient updating to reflect new variants.&lt;/p&gt;— Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1355148509037682691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tKMl1n"&gt;Blood drawn from people vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had antibodies that blocked the B.1.351 virus, new research showed. However, it took around &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/25/moderna-vaccine-less-effective-variant/"&gt;six times more&lt;/a&gt; of them to block this strain than the predominant form of the virus that the vaccine was designed against. Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-works-against-mutations-found-in-u-k-south-africa-variants-lab-study-finds-11611802559?mod=e2tw"&gt;also produces antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that block viruses with mutations found on the B.1.351, although it takes slightly more of them as well, preliminary research showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYxG44"&gt;Both the authorized vaccines produce sky-high levels of antibodies to begin with, so there’s some room for a slight drop-off in potency. That high starting point means there’s more of a cushion against changes in the virus, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/dr-fauci-says-covid-vaccines-appear-to-be-less-effective-against-some-new-strains.html"&gt;said in a press briefing&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Khpt"&gt;One of the reasons that Moderna might still want to update their vaccine is to maintain those impressive levels of antibodies, says Stephen Goldstein, who studies evolutionary virology at the University of Utah. An additional shot designed to target the new variant could theoretically boost the body’s antibody response, even against a more formidable foe. “We’re in good shape for at least like the next few months with these new variants, but we would maybe like to get back up to those really, really high levels of neutralizing antibodies that is the standout feature of these vaccines,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FolUk8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;scientists still don’t know what antibody levels someone needs to generate in order to be protected from COVID-19&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u53K9E"&gt;Part of the uncertainty comes because scientists still don’t know what antibody levels someone needs to generate in order to be protected from COVID-19. “We can’t just do an experiment in a lab and say that it’s time to update the vaccine,” Goldstein says. “There’s a little bit of guesswork involved.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1eKgW"&gt;There are a few different ways for researchers to take some of the guesswork out of the equation. &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/84288/WHO_IVB_13.01_eng.pdf"&gt;Scientists could &lt;/a&gt;measure the antibody levels of people who were vaccinated but still got sick with COVID-19, and identify the cutoff where the vaccine wasn’t protective. They &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/84288/WHO_IVB_13.01_eng.pdf"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; also compare the efficacy of a new vaccine that generates a high antibody response with an older version of that vaccine with lower potency. Animal models may work, too. In December, a team looked into the relationship between protection and antibody numbers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-020-03041-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F29%2F22255198%2Fcovid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;, finding that relatively low levels blocked the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A researcher in California checks if a coronavirus sample is one of the concerning variants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v2rkbx"&gt;“People are working to measure this, and try to get a better picture of what the things that are easy for us to measure — like antibodies — tell us about the thing we’re most interested in, which is how well can you be protected against disease,” Morris says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3d0PW"&gt;Scientists already have that information about more well-known viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859764/"&gt;like influenza&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers and regulators know what levels of antibodies the flu vaccine needs to generate in order to provide enough protection against the flu. They don’t need to run a full-blown clinical trial to test how effective a new flu shot is — instead, the Food and Drug Administration will approve new flu vaccines based on the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947948/"&gt;antibody response&lt;/a&gt; they generate in a trial in a small group of people. Once a flu vaccine meets that threshold and is approved, that company &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947948/"&gt;can modify it&lt;/a&gt; against each new seasonal flu strain without having to collect new clinical data. Ideally, researchers will eventually be able to do something similar for COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mCBbZ"&gt;It could be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dvergano/status/1354486593642496000"&gt;a few months&lt;/a&gt; before we have a good grasp on the amount of immune response that corresponds with protection from COVID-19. When they do, the FDA &lt;a href="https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143669/COVID-Mutants-Vaccine-Changes-Likely-To-Need-Immunogenicity-Studies-Not-Big-Efficacy-Trials"&gt;might sign off&lt;/a&gt; on updated or booster vaccines based on data showing that a new version can push the body to generate that level of immune response, rather than ask that companies go through clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcnNHR"&gt;“FDA has already given thought to developing a potential pathway, should changes need to be made to authorized COVID-19 vaccines or other products based on information on emerging variants,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1353857674526543872"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;FDA has already given thought to developing a potential pathway, should changes need to be made to authorized COVID-19 vaccines or other products based on information on emerging variants.  We are committed to having a public and transparent process around our path forward.&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Janet Woodcock (@DrWoodcockFDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1353857674526543872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOV7ro"&gt;The decision to push out any booster shots and adjusted vaccines should also take into account how much of a new form of the virus is circulating in a given area, Goldstein says. Right now, there are only two confirmed cases of people in the United States infected with the B.1.351 virus strain, though there could be others that haven’t been identified. “It’s still quite rare outside of South Africa, so we don’t want to be vaccinating people in the US against the strain that’s not present in the US,” Goldstein says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4XnUy"&gt;Eventually, it might become more widespread, and it might make sense to give people that additional protection. That’s why it’s encouraging that Moderna is preparing the boosters now. “We want to be prepared in case that virus becomes more prevalent,” Goldstein says. Other strains of the coronavirus that are more able to evade existing vaccines could also emerge in the future. “I think that it will be really good to get the technological and regulatory side of things lined up ahead of time, for if and when we need to roll out a vaccine update,” Morris says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. The platform also enables professors to track the websites students visit during their exams, and bar them from functions like copy / pasting and printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KB23V"&gt;Though Proctorio and similar services have been around for years, their use exploded in early 2020 when COVID-19 drove schools around the US to move a bulk of their instruction online. So, too, has scrutiny towards their practices. Students and instructors at universities around the country have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;spoken out&lt;/a&gt; against the widespread use of the software, claiming that it causes unnecessary anxiety, violates privacy, and has the potential to discriminate against marginalized students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWTjeK"&gt;In an email to instructors, ADA coordinator Allison Kushner and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts wrote that professors who continue to use Proctorio through the summer 2021 term are “expected to accommodate students that raise accessibility issues,” and that the campus is “investigating longer-term remote proctoring options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TRO48O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service “was never considered to be a long-term campus proctoring solution.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEdHm"&gt;Proctorio has been controversial on UIUC’s campus since the service was introduced &lt;a href="https://dailyillini.com/news/2020/04/17/proctorio-concerns/"&gt;last spring&lt;/a&gt;, and concerned students only grew more vocal through the fall 2020 semester. (Due to COVID-19, the school now operates with a hybrid of online and in-person instruction.) Over 1,000 people signed a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/uiuc-stop-proctoring-exams-through-proctorio-proctoru?redirect=false"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the university to stop using the service. “Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy,” reads the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWp9y"&gt;UIUC is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;many campuses&lt;/a&gt; where remote proctoring has faced backlash. A &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/miami-university-end-proctorio-use-at-miami-university"&gt;Miami University petition&lt;/a&gt;, which gathered over 500 signatures, declared that “Proctorio’s design invades student rights, is inherently ableist and discriminatory, and is inconsistent with peer reviewed research.” Over 3,500 signatories have called on the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-regina-administration-call-on-the-university-of-regina-to-remove-proctortrack?redirect=false"&gt;University of Regina&lt;/a&gt; to end its use of ProctorTrack, another automated proctoring service. A 1,200-signature petition urges the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-central-florida-ask-ucf-to-stop-using-honor-lock-which-is-a-severe-invasion-of-privacy"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; to dump Honorlock, another similar software, declaring that “students should not be forced to sign away their privacy and rights in order to take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5cVtd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Professors and staff&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the service as well. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Proctorio (alongside four other test-proctoring services), claiming that the services’ collection of personal information amounts to “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” Even US senators have gotten involved; a coalition including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Proctorio and two similar services in December citing a number of concerns about their business practices. “Students have run head on into the shortcomings of these technologies—shortcomings that fall heavily on vulnerable communities and perpetuate discriminatory biases,” wrote the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJ1qj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdsqZ"&gt;The complaints largely revolve around security and privacy — Proctorio’s recordings give instructors and the service access to some of test-takers’ browsing data, and a glimpse of their private homes in some cases. (Proctorio stated in its &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/Proctorio-senate-response-010721.pdf"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the Senators’ letter that “test-taker data is secured and processed through multiple layers of encryption” and that Proctorio retains its recordings “for the minimum amount of time required by either our customer or by applicable law.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP15AB"&gt;Accessibility is another common concern. Students have reported not having access to a webcam at home, or enough bandwidth to accommodate the service; one test-taker told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she had to take her first chemistry test in a Starbucks parking lot last semester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rEzh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;Students have also reported&lt;/a&gt; that services like Proctorio have difficulty identifying test-takers with darker skin tones, and may disproportionately flag students with certain disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215727/examsoft-online-exams-testing-facial-recognition-report"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that even the best facial-recognition algorithms make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do identifying white ones. Proctorio stated in its response that “We believe all of these cases were due to issues relating to lighting, webcam position, or webcam quality, not race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xv21w0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instructors utilizing Proctorio should inform students that they are aware of the challenges that Proctorio presents”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBBJj4"&gt;“We take these concerns seriously,” reads UIUC’s email, citing student complaints related to “accessibility, privacy, data security and equity” as factors in its decision. It recommends that students for whom Proctorio presents a barrier to test-taking “make alternative arrangements” as the program is phased out, and indicates that accessibility will be considered in the selection of the next remote-proctoring solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG4j4n"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, UIUC Associate Chancellor Robin Kaler said “ We had secured a short-duration license for Proctorio usage in March 2020 under an emergency procurement action permitted by the State of Illinois in direct response to COVID. We sent a message notifying instructors that they will not have it as a tool beyond the duration of the short-term procurement. We are investigating remote proctoring tools for longer term usage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A8G9C"&gt;We’ve reached out to Proctorio for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDzTtu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:27AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added UIUC statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘Snyder Cut’ of Justice League is coming to HBO Max on March 18th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24z3zEtRSO9NmEaYZcR1XGah6-I=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739550/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPJvXN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; (aka “The Snyder Cut”) will hit &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeSubscriberGoal012721&amp;amp;source=Verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th, the director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1355152770408476677?s=20"&gt;announced on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4kcQr"&gt;The original theatrical release of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; debuted in November 2017 and, ahead of its release, endured a difficult production. Most notably, director Joss Whedon stepped in to finish the film during post-production after Snyder stepped away from the project for &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455?utm_source=twitter"&gt;personal reasons&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; was released, fans criticized Whedon’s contributions to the film, which included a lighter tone. Fans started an internet campaign for Warner Bros. to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873696/justice-league-zack-snyder-directors-cut-conspiracy-theory"&gt;“Release the Snyder Cut”&lt;/a&gt; in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TEEsIZ"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Reborn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnyderCut?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SnyderCut&lt;/a&gt; Streaming 3.18.21 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UsUnited?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UsUnited&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q5pVjCwYur"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q5pVjCwYur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Snyder (@ZackSnyder) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1355152770408476677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lvhb7N"&gt;Warner Bros. previously announced in May that the long-rumored extended cut was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263044/justice-league-snyder-cut-warnermedia-hbo-max-zack-ben-affleck-henry-cavill-gal-gaot-streaming"&gt;getting an official release&lt;/a&gt; but as an exclusive on WarnerMedia’s new streaming service, HBO Max. With a firm release date for &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League &lt;/em&gt;finally set, the film is launching at a competitive time for superhero media as it will release one day before the debut of Marvel Studios’ newest miniseries, &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/exclusive-first-look-falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-march-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will stream exclusively on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/977661/9358?sharedid=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POMyoa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only new film arriving on HBO Max this year. In December, Warner Bros. announced that every single one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;films in 2021 would release simultaneously&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max the same day they premiered in movie theaters. AT&amp;amp;T now credits the decision for helping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;boost HBO Max subscriber numbers&lt;/a&gt; in its latest earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xMBQC"&gt;A single shot of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine can prevent 85 percent of severe cases of the disease, the company &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, it is 66 percent effective against both moderate and severe cases of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQFwzA"&gt;“We’re 85 perfect effective at preventing severe disease, which we define as disease that makes you feel particularly sick at home, or may go to the hospital, or worse,” Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at Johnson and Johnson, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-results/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;. The company plans to file for emergency authorization next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cT0gi0"&gt;The efficacy is lower than that of the two COVID-19 vaccines already authorized for use in the United States, which prevent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;about 95&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; of symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Those vaccines each require two doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="95YptH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8KDdx"&gt;Johnson and Johnson ran its trial in the United States, Latin America, and South Africa. In the United States, the vaccine was 72 percent effective against moderate and severe COVID-19. But in South Africa, where a variant form of the coronavirus is widely circulating, the vaccine was 57 percent effective. Experts have been concerned that the variant, called B.1.351, is different enough from the original virus that vaccines created against the original might not work as well against it. This week, the pharmaceutical company Novavax also announced that its vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/novavax-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-90-effective-but-far-less-so-against-one-variant/"&gt;less effective&lt;/a&gt; against B.1.351 than against other forms of the virus. The first cases of the variant in the US were identified this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i5IKl"&gt;Still, the data from the Johnson and Johnson trial meets early benchmarks that the Food and Drug Administration set for a COVID-19 vaccine — the agency said last June that it would sign off on vaccines as long as they were at least &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download"&gt;50 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZdeaU"&gt;The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is made by inserting the gene from a snippet of the coronavirus into a harmless, weakened form of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;adenovirus&lt;/a&gt;, which usually causes symptoms like pink eye or diarrhea. Then, the body produces copies of that virus snippet, and develops antibodies against it. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;different strategy&lt;/a&gt; than used by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna, which insert the genetic snippet &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;into an oily bubble instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhVgH"&gt;Even though the vaccine does not appear to work as well as the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, experts say it could still be useful in the fight against COVID-19, particularly while supplies of the more effective vaccines are still limited. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine offers less of a logistical challenge than the other two, which have to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures and require two shots. This vaccine only takes one shot and can be stored in regular refrigerators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wnCk7"&gt;Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-results/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that he would take a Johnson and Johnson vaccine if it was available before he could get access to either the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVAbWV"&gt;The company is also testing a two-shot regime of it’s vaccine, which might bump up its efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t11J6q"&gt;Johnson and Johnson received funding to develop its vaccine from the US as part of &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/05/hhs-dod-collaborate-with-johnson-and-johnson-to-produce-millions-of-covid-19-investigational-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt; and has an agreement to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-100-million-doses-of-investigational-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;100 million doses&lt;/a&gt;. The company could ship about &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/j-j-covid-vaccine-supply-to-start-at-2-million-doses-gao-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;2 million doses&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it secures authorization from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCCZp"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;26 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the US so far. &lt;/p&gt;
