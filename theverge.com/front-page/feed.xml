    <title>Amazon appears to have removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7Aqxw"&gt;One month ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow suddenly and mysteriously disappeared&lt;/a&gt; from the giant online retailer’s storefront, with almost all their electronics vanishing from Amazon’s shelves. Today, popular battery and charger brand RavPower has completely disappeared as well (via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1405202548760334339%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;Nicole Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymIKjk"&gt;All of the company’s product listings have disappeared, leaving blank white spaces in RavPower’s Amazon storefront. Searches for “RavPower” don’t bring up any listings for products made by the company. Existing links to RavPower products either point to Amazon’s “Sorry, we couldn’t find that page” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17577654/amazon-prime-day-website-down-deals-service-disruption"&gt;cute 404 dogs&lt;/a&gt;, or listings that read “Currently unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jOz0exolfEqLyA0V0e5YMvXZKWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662870/ravpower_amaozn_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RavPower’s seller page is still up, but it’s empty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zs6aQB"&gt;By and large, this is exactly what happened to Aukey, Mpow, and other lesser-known electronics retailers last month — except here, whoever did this has been a bit more thorough. You can actually still find a couple of Aukey listings on Amazon, while RavPower seems to have none. Another important difference may be that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F16%2F22536976%2Famazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RavPower has its own separate online shop&lt;/a&gt; that ranks high in Google search, so it may not strictly need to depend on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMXCKX"&gt;Amazon and RavPower didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, but we’re not expecting much: Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;would not tell us last month&lt;/a&gt; if it actually removed Aukey and Mpow, merely giving us a generic statement that suggested it generally suspends sellers that violate “the integrity of our store.” Then, Aukey and Mpow didn’t respond to requests for comment at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyKGyo"&gt;But it’s not hard to imagine what happened here: on Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Nguyen ran a story&lt;/a&gt; about how her new RavPower charger included an offer for a $35 gift card in exchange for a review, something that Amazon confirmed was a violation of company policy. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned incentivized reviews&lt;/a&gt; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cSx9lL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following my fake review story, listings for Amazon-native electronics brand RAVPower are gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company offered $35 gift cards for reviews on a product that was sold directly by Amazon itself. RAVPower acted as a wholesale vendor on that listing.&lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb"&gt;https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/znp9u48YHV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/znp9u48YHV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nicole nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEseZ"&gt;Fake, inflated, paid, and other forms of scammy reviews run rampant on Amazon (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;other online platforms&lt;/a&gt;, to be fair), and I get cards like these in my random Amazon purchases all the time. It’s weird to think that RavPower would need to stoop to this behavior, though: we’ve regularly featured good products that the company makes, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;our favorite wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ctEj"&gt;Amazon is actively trying to clamp down on this kind of fraud, though it’s not always successful. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;In a Wednesday blog post&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of its enforcement efforts, the company says it “stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer” in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaguar Land Rover says it’s developing a hydrogen-powered prototype vehicle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tmnuJH0i5HJ-ymqxpYFDldgEEiA=/0x12:2000x1345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461987/jaguar_land_rover.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Jaguar Land Rover&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uva88C"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover is working on a prototype hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), which it plans to start testing later this year, the company announced. The vehicle is based on its Land Rover Defender, and the company says it will focus its testing on “key attributes” such as fuel consumption and off-road capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFRiVF"&gt;The FCEV is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/reimagine"&gt;company’s strategy&lt;/a&gt; to achieve zero tailpipe emissions by 2036 and net zero carbon emissions across its supply chain and operations by 2039. Fuel cell electric vehicles generate electricity from hydrogen to power their electric motors, and Jaguar Land Rover considers them complementary to battery electric vehicles. “We know hydrogen has a role to play in the future powertrain mix across the whole transport industry, and alongside battery electric vehicles, said Ralph Clague, head of the company’s hydrogen and fuel cells division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YX8rOa"&gt;The tech behind FCEVs makes them “ideal for larger, longer-range vehicles, or those operated in hot or cold environments,” Jaguar Land Rover said in its announcement, as the vehicles “provide high energy density and rapid refuelling, and minimal loss of range in low temperatures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yCXK7"&gt;Other carmakers have announced plans to develop hydrogen-powered vehicles; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;Toyota said in April &lt;/a&gt;that its electric vehicle strategy would include 70 new models by 2025, including hydrogen fuel cell models. And even though Honda discontinued its Clarity EV last year, the company says it plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;continue to make a hydrogen fuel cell version&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251582/gm-hydrogen-truck-navistar-oneh2-range-date"&gt;in January, General Motors announced&lt;/a&gt; a partnership with trucking firm Navistar and hydrogen fuel cell company OneH2 that includes plans for a fleet of zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QWoOk"&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251582/gm-hydrogen-truck-navistar-oneh2-range-date"&gt;doesn’t yet have a robust fueling infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; for hydrogen vehicles, however; while there are 39 hydrogen fueling stations in California and a few in Hawaii, only a handful of stations are open along the East Coast so far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack is rolling out a new scheduled send feature </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMZ6nOpuNCzgjV7zF1h0Va_UAQ4=/0x24:1024x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461856/Scheduled_Send.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="50GDWd"&gt;Slack has announced a &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012915082"&gt;new Scheduled Send feature&lt;/a&gt; that the company is starting to roll out today, which — as the name implies — will let users schedule messages to send at a later time and date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVJcaL"&gt;The scheduled send feature adds a new drop-down arrow to the green “send message” button in Slack’s desktop app. Clicking it will reveal a new menu that allows for scheduling a message to send to a room, direct message, or group thread later on. Mobile users will be able to access a similar menu by long-pressing on the send button in the Slack app on Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tbG0zb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A better way to message co-workers across time zones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rA553A"&gt;Slack will offer both pre-filled options (like “tomorrow morning at 9:00AM”) as well as the ability to set a custom date and time to send a message. Messages can be scheduled up to to 120 days in advance, and users will be able to reschedule, edit, or delete scheduled messages before they’re sent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xgi2vQ"&gt;“Today we launched Scheduled Send to empower users to communicate and collaborate in a way that works best for them,” the company announced in a statement, explaining that “teams shouldn’t be obligated to sync their schedules in order to communicate effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0bHYj"&gt;The ability to schedule messages is a critical one given the various time zones and locations that offices — both remote, in-person, and hybrid — stretch across in today’s work world. And while email services like Gmail have offered the ability to schedule emails for later (so that users aren’t pinging teams at odd hours or getting messages lost overnight), the feature has been notably absent from Slack until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Eiwd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2AaNY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China, Russia aim for first joint astronaut Moon landings in next decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHWjwz-PrvIuFTBqrT8yV9bugxU=/148x0:1729x1054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461853/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_12.12.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fg0ddv"&gt;China and Russia expect to put their first crews of astronauts on the Moon sometime in the next decade, representatives said on Wednesday. Already established plans for their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) include a lineup of robotic lunar missions and coming up with a legal framework for exploring the Moon, an effort similar to the NASA-led Artemis lunar program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8SfvG"&gt;Officials from the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, gave a joint presentation during the Global Space Exploration Conference in Russia on their three-phase plan to build a network of Moon bases and satellites in lunar orbit. The space agencies formally teamed up on the project in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wQAl4j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are still focusing on unmanned lunar exploration in the next ten years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yxL9r6"&gt;The first and most of the second phase of the lunar project “is just preparatory work” involving uncrewed missions, Wu Yanhua, CNSA’s deputy director, said through a translator. “We are still focusing on unmanned lunar exploration in the next ten years,” he said, responding to an audience question on when the first Russian or Chinese astronauts will be on the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqQ22w"&gt;CNSA is currently focused on sending astronauts to its new low-Earth-orbiting space station, whose first module launched in April. The station’s first crew of three astronauts is expected to launch from China sometime this month for a three-month stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nxjpw8"&gt;Russia and China’s plans for a Moon presence set up a race between the countries and the US. Their ILRS is taking shape in parallel to NASA’s Artemis program, a multibillion-dollar effort to put US astronauts on the Moon as soon as 2024 and establish a long-term presence on the surface in the following decade. NASA is working with Japan, Canada, and the European Space Agency on a Lunar Gateway. The Gateway is a planned outpost orbiting the Moon designed to relay crews of astronauts to future base stations on the lunar surface. Russia, NASA’s biggest partner on the International Space Station, had been in talks with the US to participate in the Gateway program before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321114/lunar-moon-space-station-russia-china-agreement-nasa"&gt;turning to China’s ILRS plan instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="17YXIv"&gt;China and Russia have said the ILRS is open to international partners, including NASA. The two countries are also working on a “dedicated legal framework” for exploring the Moon, Roscosmos deputy director-general Sergey Saveliev said at the conference. An initial version of the agreement should be ready by year’s end, Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXMyRb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We also welcome all the parties to participate in it and follow the legal framework”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PEChKY"&gt;That framework currently lags behind NASA’s Artemis Accords, a similar document that aims to set legal norms for the Moon operations under its Artemis program. US officials emphasize the Accords are an interpretation of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that promotes peaceful coordination between countries on the Moon. NASA signed its eleventh partner, Brazil, onto the Artemis Accords on Tuesday, after courting other US allies like South Korea, Ukraine, Australia and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChVtGv"&gt;“We have already established a specialized legal team under the joint working group” for the China-Russia-led legal framework, Wu said during the conference panel. “We also welcome all the parties to participate in it and follow the legal framework.” Saveliev said Roscosmos is talking to the European Space Agency and the French space agency as prospective partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m5Z8H8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ru" dir="ltr"&gt;Видеоконцепция создания Международной научной лунной станции    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;После презентации ознакомиться с Дорожной картой и Руководством по участию в проекте &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%9C%D0%9D%D0%9B%D0%A1?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#МНЛС&lt;/a&gt; можно будет на официальных сайтах Роскосмоса и КНКА &lt;a href="https://t.co/DycyqhhPFZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DycyqhhPFZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— РОСКОСМОС (@roscosmos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1405137294076559364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y2ndyB"&gt;The agenda for ILRS consists of three phases. The first phase, between 2021 and 2025, involves at least six robotic missions launching to the Moon, split evenly between China and Russia, that will scout future lunar landing locations and conduct scientific reconnaissance. The next phase, from 2026 to 2035, focuses heavily on construction, with “massive” cargo deliveries and the complete establishment of facilities in lunar orbit and on the Moon’s surface. The final phase begins in 2036, when routine operations begin. That includes “lunar research and exploration, technology verification, supporting human lunar landing[s] with the completed ILRS. Expanding and maintaining modules if needed,” a presentation slide said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfazFb"&gt;Despite a stretched-out timeline for crewed Moon landings, NASA administrator Bill Nelson has cast China’s growing space capabilities as “aggressive,” pointing to Beijing’s lunar plans and its debut Mars landing last month as a reason for the US to race ahead for a 2024 Moon landing. He’s urged lawmakers to keep an eye on the country’s growing partnership with Russia, a longtime NASA ally in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSxNt7"&gt;“We are prepared to work with the US in space,” Russian president Vladimir Putin said in a NBC news interview on Monday, ahead of his meeting with President Joe Biden. “I think recently the head of NASA said that he could not imagine development of space programs without its partnership with Russia. We welcome this statement.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitch streamers fighting to keep minority languages alive</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mnKH1914-_s685uDcb0VFx2Hbo8=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461643/acastro_210615_4632_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Entertainment meets activism&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jot8Ho"&gt;Minority languages are often associated with aging rural communities, thought to have fallen out of use or confined to textbooks. Defined simply as a language spoken by less than half of the population in a country, they adapt with the times like any living language, often due to the efforts of enterprising young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="tppJjg"&gt;Recently, many of these languages have found new life from an unexpected source: video game streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FwH02"&gt;On Twitch, streamers from around the world are showcasing indigenous languages as a form of entertainment and activism. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fmagazine%2Farticle%2Fvanishing-languages&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F16%2F22533319%2Ftwitch-streamers-minority-languages-basque-gaelic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Estimates&lt;/a&gt; show that we lose one language every two weeks, and half of our 7,000 languages will be extinct by the end of the century, so preserving these tongues and the cultural identities that go with them is crucial. With its easy access, potential for a huge audience, and creators’ ability to combine hobbies and language promotion, it’s easy to see why young minority language speakers have turned to Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f61fy4"&gt;Many minority language streamers lack an official language tag for their streams, and these creators see their content lost in the miscellany of the “Other” tag, making it hard for other speakers to find, connect with, and enjoy gaming in their own language. Good news arrived for some on May 26th when Twitch announced that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448809/transgender-twitch-tags-lgbt-streaming-identity"&gt;add over 350 new stream tags&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing different ethnic groups and underrepresented communities. The platform was frank about how it has been slow to act on adding the tags users want. However, not all streamers received the opportunity for visibility they’d been hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3ApnaH"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mXQUR7"&gt;Two groups who missed out were Basque and Galician streamers. Basque, which is native to the semi-autonomous Basque Country straddling southwestern France and northern Spain, is one of the oldest languages still spoken and unrelated to any other in the world. Further along the Iberian Peninsula, the Galician language is spoken by around 2.4 million people in a tiny corner of Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPnr6z"&gt;Inspired by the success of the #CatalanLoveTwitch campaign, which saw the minority Romance language added as a streaming language tag, a group of Basque streamers launched #3000Twitz last December, a campaign to see their language achieve the same status. Despite a petition, which is by far the most voted in the Twitch User Voice forums and having now surpassed the number of votes the Catalan petition received, Basque streamers are still awaiting a response from the streaming giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDeOEH"&gt;Iruñe, who streams as arkkuso, is one of the founding members of the campaign. For her, the addition of Basque as a streaming language has broader implications for the survival and visibility of the language. “It is very important that Basque has a presence online and therefore on social networks,” she says. “Nowadays, if you’re not on the internet, you don’t exist. The same will happen very soon with languages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KJ3EQO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nowadays, if you’re not on the internet, you don’t exist”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yfXrcY"&gt;Without the help of a tag to identify streamers, Iruñe feels that Twitch has made Basque creators invisible. As a result, the growth of the Basque streaming community has been entirely grassroots, and language activism is part and parcel of her channel. “I believe that at the end of the day, all of us who create content in Basque are [activists],” she says. “For many of us, the relationship we have with our mother tongue is fundamental for us when it comes to enjoying what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vma0b"&gt;Fellow streamer and native Basque speaker Eneko found himself in a similar situation. “At first, I started streaming without knowing anyone on Twitch. And since there was no Basque language tag, I didn’t know if there were more people or if they were just very difficult to find. I hit a roadblock because I wanted to stream in Basque, but it meant not reaching anyone,” he says. The current camaraderie between Basque streamers and the popular support their campaign enjoys would have seemed like a fantasy when he first started out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S819fT"&gt;“When you meet people, it is through raids and not by randomly finding someone streaming the type of content you like. There are campaigns calling for double labeling because today, many of us speak several languages, and choosing only one (especially when one is a minority) greatly reduces your ability to reach people. In these circumstances, either you participate in the digital disappearance of your language or you remain visible only to a very small part of Twitch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgGGkb"&gt;The collective Galician Gamers launched a language tag petition around the same time as their Basque neighbors, with the aim of “promoting the use of Galician, not only as a home life language, but as a language for culture and entertainment as well.” Dubbed “Twitch en Galego” (“Twitch in Galician”), the movement’s social media accounts announce when any Galician-speaking streamer is going live and has exploded from a small group of four or five streamers to having a Discord server with over 200 members with 58 Twitch channels registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3Iyqo"&gt;Given that other less popular language petitions such as Ukrainian have now been added as official streaming languages, Iruñe is understandably frustrated. “We are going to continue creating varied content in Basque, quality content that we want to use to reach more people as we are still a small community. Likewise, we want to create channels of dialogue with Twitch, and for this, we want to work together with the Basque government as well as get Basque streamers who have lots of followers to help us achieve this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByciWx"&gt;Adrián, who goes by Dinav in the Galician Gamers team, is equally undeterred. CRTVG, a regional TV network in Galicia, recently created a Twitch channel and invited the Galician Gamers on to discuss their cause. “Though we’ll still act independently, organising events on certain dates to generate movement on the internet and get more people to sign the request, getting the support of Galician public institutions is a path we are open to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rhzkEy"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dRo5Hy"&gt;On the other side of the world, a community of streamers of te reo Māori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, is thriving. Despite suffering a decline after the Second World War, it has been enjoying a renaissance due to revitalization efforts in recent years, including national Māori Language Week and Māori immersion schools. According to the 2018 census, 4 percent of the population speaks the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWO91h"&gt;Twitch creator Rangiora has lived his whole life through teo reo Māori. Combining his two passions, he streams under the moniker PrideLandz, and it’s only natural that he would do so in his native tongue. “Te reo Māori is what connects me to my culture, my ancestors, my family, my environment, and helps to navigate the world I live in,” he shares. “In the last five years, I noticed I was speaking next to no Māori because I wasn’t surrounded by confident speakers. Streaming in Māori has provided a space where I can practice, share, and learn about the language more often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9P8iQ"&gt;One of the most fascinating aspects of Māori streamers’ content is their incorporation of an ancestral language into modern gaming. As he lays waste to beasts on the screen superimposed behind him, Rangiora explains how game titles are translated into te reo Māori. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is composed using the name of the Māori god of war, translating as something like “a call to arms in the realm of Tūmatauenga.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oufy5S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I feel as if people are learning something every time I stream”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkC8uc"&gt;His streams are open to speakers of all levels and even those just interested in learning more about the culture. “I don’t stream entirely in Māori, but I try to share some knowledge such as having Māori word of the week or Māori phrase or saying as something viewers can redeem with their channel points. Hopefully we can inspire more people to speak [the language] because I’m aware that a lot of Māori [people] aren’t confident due to colonization and the suppression in the past. I feel as if people are learning something every time I stream as we try to normalize Māori in this space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTOvop"&gt;The community of Māori and Pacific Islander streamers on Twitch have been a huge motivator for Rangiora, so much so that he’s launched a campaign to achieve Partner status on the platform. Spurred on by support from Ngati Gaming, a Discord community of Māori streamers, the ultimate goal is to launch a Māori esports organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zjenHi"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rQZaWd"&gt;Multiplayer online gaming has been a lifeline for speakers of regional tongues to stay connected over the course of the pandemic. YnChwarae, meaning “In Play,” is a group of Welsh language streamers. Pre-COVID, they met monthly to livestream games while chatting in Welsh; for the time being, they’ve brought their club online on a weekly basis. “I feel it’s important to be able to express yourself in the language you feel most comfortable. For Welsh as a language to grow quicker, there has to be a space for people to do everything in Welsh and this includes the digital realm,” says Morgan from the group. “Gaming can be an extremely sociable activity and the majority of our streams reflect this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nUDXs"&gt;Despite a gradually increasing amount Welsh speakers over the last decade, there’s still work to be done in maintaining its survival. “A lot of the crew are not able to use Welsh in their everyday jobs, so streaming with YnChwarae gives them the opportunity to use the language meaningfully doing something they love and not forget it,” Morgan explains. “We are allowing other Welsh speakers to access Welsh language content on Twitch and be a part of our streams through communicating with us in the chat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rcFNa"&gt;Lacking in the community size of their Welsh counterparts, streamers of other Celtic languages have pioneered the use of their tongue on Twitch. Gwenn, a streamer from Brittany in the northwest of France, is the only person on Twitch who regularly streams in Breton, the traditional language of the region. As a severely endangered language, Breton faces more challenges than just visibility online. Having lost around 800,000 speakers since 1950, the language is not recognized at a national level by the French state, and so it receives little government support in media or public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gxgefQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important to be able to express yourself in the language you feel most comfortable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qNJflm"&gt;“I think it is important for Breton to be everywhere Breton speakers are,” Gwenn says. “There are a lot of young Breton speakers, and they use what young people use: Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Instagram... I think it’s a good thing to grow minority language communities on those platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukjtw9"&gt;Like YnChwarae, the interactive aspect of Twitch is a huge draw. Although happy to help learners, Gwenn’s target audience is advanced speakers. “When I stream, the beginners can take their time to write out sentences that I will read and correct, and the people who are fluent are happy with just meeting other Breton-speaking people, which could be already rare in the pre-lockdown world and is even rarer now. That is why I usually stream chill games like &lt;em&gt;GeoGuessr&lt;/em&gt; that allow [people] to read the chat and have subjects to talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kK8Nmu"&gt;Twitch’s addition of new tags is bittersweet. “I think it’s good for the communities that will benefit from those new tags. I wasn’t expecting Twitch to add minority languages, so I’m not really disappointed. I will follow what happens for more active language communities like Basque to see if it is something that can be achievable for Breton before trying to spend energy on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZIX1g"&gt;Cluicheamaid, the brainchild of Scottish streamer Robbie, is an award-nominated Scots Gaelic video game streaming series including &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/em&gt; all in the ancient Scottish tongue. Classed as definitely endangered on the UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, Robbie’s channel is an opportunity for speakers to use their Gaelic in a world without English subtitles. “Streaming is such a new form of entertainment, and I like giving Gaelic representation on the cutting edge,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6wcsc"&gt;Existing in a linguistic niche has given him a different perspective of what success on Twitch looks like. “There are fewer folk I can get watching my stream in terms of total numbers, but also I am not in competition with thousands of other video game streamers at the same time. I think when you grow up speaking a minoritised language, you have to adjust your expectations of success. Every stream that I get four or five folk all talking Gaelic in the chat feels like a massive win because that is what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cfNgA4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I like giving Gaelic representation on the cutting edge”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1JixYs"&gt;Included in Twitch’s recent launch of new tags is “Scottish,” referring streamers from Scotland as opposed to those speaking Scots Gaelic. Irish, Welsh, and Māori creators found themselves with a new national identifier for their streams. For minority language speakers who fall into these groups, the reaction in terms of linguistic visibility has been ambivalent. “Language tags would be more useful to me than nationality tags,” Robbie says. “My stream will have more in common with Irish-language streamers than most generic ‘Scottish’ streams. So I am hopeful but not expectant that the addition of the new tags is a step towards more easy identification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yUETkO"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="pZhURH"&gt;Across the sea in Ireland, Úna-Minh — or yunitex as she is known on Twitch — has brought the Irish national language to an audience of over 2,500 followers. Like Gwenn and Robbie, she is the only person regularly creating content in her language, but the main aim of her bilingual channel isn’t activism. “Ultimately, I’m using it [Irish] as I would in my everyday life, and if that inspires people to become more interested, then that’s a welcome bonus,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNtlm1"&gt;She has partnered with language-learning app Duolingo to bring a little more Gaeilge to the world through her streams, be that through livestreaming &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; or painting and sketching. However, she believes that minority language Twitch creators like herself can’t be at the forefront of language revival alone. “Too many times do I see people treating people like me, fluent speakers, like their personal teachers or translators, and it’s not fair. I’m not a teacher, I’m just me. I think it’s important that communities don’t rely on one person ever to be a beacon, they need to work together to keep the language alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icLoQ2"&gt;With or without formal support from Twitch, those who stream in minority languages are doing the important work of ensuring that their mother tongue is used among young people, outside of the classroom, and within a modern context — the key ingredients for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JvBgq"&gt;Aurélie Joubert, assistant professor of Language and Society at the University of Groningen, is all too aware of this. “The problem is that for languages to survive, they need to be considered as equal in their function and their communicative value for their own community. Language planners have realized that if kids nowadays speak more Irish, Breton, or Basque at school, it doesn’t mean that they use it in the playground. The reality is that a language needs to be perceived positively everywhere. This type of modern online interaction attracts the younger generation who needs to see and hear their minority language being used in modern online platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VOBEen"&gt;Across linguistic groups, one thing remains clear: minority language movements on Twitch are grassroots, community-centric, and driven by small gains. Visibility is essential for minority language creators to grow and thrive. “We sometimes see minority languages as not fit for modern technology but if they are not part of it in the first place, they cannot develop the corresponding vocabulary needed for it,” Joubert explains. “Linguists increasingly adopt a holistic approach towards language planning and that includes all modes of interaction, social media, and video gaming. It is a battle to lead on all fronts.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smart displays for every home</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Show family of smart displays.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From Alexa to Google, the best smart displays to buy right now&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IVixP7"&gt;Smart displays, those cousins of voice-controlled smart speakers with full touchscreen displays, are great devices for managing your smart home, displaying useful bits of information throughout the day, or even playing music or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JMn4b"&gt;Like a smart speaker, a smart display is primarily voice-controlled, so you can bark commands at it from across a room. But unlike a smart speaker, a smart display can display information such as upcoming appointments, weather, in-progress timers, the current time, a grocery list, recipes, and more without you having to utter a single command. They can also be used as a modern, cloud-connected digital photo frame, allowing you to see all of those memories you’ve captured over the years that are currently trapped on your smartphone. Some models also come with built-in cameras that can be used for video calling to other smart displays or even phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67gXUF"&gt;The best smart display has all of the capabilities of the best smart speakers, including good-sounding speakers of its own for listening to music or watching video. They are available in a variety of prices and sizes, and depending on where you want to put the display in your home, you might prefer a smaller model over one that has a larger screen and louder speakers. If you’re looking for an all-around smart display to use in your kitchen or living room, you’ll want one with a screen that’s easy to see from across the room and speakers that can fill the space with clear, pleasant sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Qd1R"&gt;There are essentially two types of smart displays available: ones that use Amazon’s Alexa assistant and ones that run on Google Assistant. Which one is better for you really depends on your needs and whether you already have a smart speaker in your home. The two platforms are more similar than they are different, but a simple way to differentiate between them is Google’s smart displays work best with Google services, such as Duo, Photos, other Nest devices, and YouTube, and Amazon’s smart displays work with Amazon services, like Prime Video, Amazon Photos, and Ring products. For most people, the best option is going to be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743409769677447969#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which virtual assistant you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qTt4ks"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PQrAAX"&gt;Best smart displays 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RB1ITB"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FVSF73"&gt;The best Alexa smart display&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="Z0E8T9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609443" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUKydh"&gt;The Echo Show 8 is the middle child in Amazon’s lineup of Alexa-powered smart displays, and it’s the best Alexa smart display. It has a bright 8-inch touchscreen, two powerful speakers that can put out a surprising level of volume, a built-in camera with a privacy shutter, and four microphones to hear voice commands. It doesn’t take up a ton of space on a counter, mantle, or bookshelf, but it can easily be seen or controlled from across a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKoMBv"&gt;The Show 8 has access to all of the same Alexa abilities as Amazon’s Echo speakers, but it includes a number of unique things that take advantage of its built-in display. You can see timers on the screen without having to ask for them, recipes are displayed with step-by-step instructions and video tutorials, grocery lists are shown right on the screen, and the Show will cycle through upcoming calendar appointments, weather reports, and news headlines whenever it’s idle. The screen can also be used to pull up feeds from video doorbells and security cameras or to view the feed from another Echo Show in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GkxBr"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 has a 13-megapixel camera that can be used for video calls through Amazon’s Alexa calling (to phones or other Echo Show displays) or Zoom. It is able to automatically pan and crop to keep you in the frame, and it generally has good image quality. The built-in privacy shutter allows you to block the camera’s view if you don’t want to make video calls or want to use it in a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8Jlno6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 8 (second gen) review: a little faster, a little better camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="x2a4xS"&gt;Since the display is a full touchscreen, you can also interact with the Echo Show 8 without having to use your voice at all, including canceling timers, controlling smart home devices, or scrolling through photos stored in Amazon Photos or Facebook albums. But the Show 8 is not designed to be an iPad-like tablet, and its interactivity is limited to simple functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okSTsA"&gt;Like Echo speakers, the Show 8 can play audio and music from a variety of sources, including Spotify, Audible, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Sirius XM. It can also play video from Amazon’s Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix. But it doesn’t have an easy way to play YouTube video (you have to go through the device’s built-in web browser, a very clumsy process), nor does it have the ability to play HBO Max or Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4wAMPU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YNUQyb"&gt;The best Google Assistant smart display&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="MYAev1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wTRK50"&gt;If you are fully invested in Google’s ecosystem or own a lot of Nest products already, the Google Nest Hub is the best smart display with Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKXHYw"&gt;A 7-inch smart display, the Nest Hub is a little smaller than the Echo Show 8 and fits more comfortably on a nightstand. Its best feature is a screen that automatically adjusts itself for the lighting in your room, so it almost looks like photos are printed on paper instead of being displayed on a screen. Combine that with Google Photos’ excellent automatic backups and smart albums that can automatically update the Nest Hub with new images whenever you take them, and you have perhaps the best digital photo frame experience you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgQI1c"&gt;The latest, second-generation Nest Hub is also able to automatically track your sleep when it’s on a nightstand, making it an ideal smart alarm clock. It also lacks a camera entirely, which every other smart display in this list includes. That means you can’t use it for video calling, but it also means you don’t have to worry about a connected camera being in your most intimate of areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2Apou8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen) review: sleep on it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Obc10t"&gt;The Nest Hub has a single speaker, which is much less powerful and doesn’t sound nearly as good as the Echo Show 8’s dual-speaker system. The 7-inch screen is also noticeably smaller, which makes it harder to see from across a room and less comfortable to watch video on. But if you watch a lot of YouTube or are a YouTube TV customer, the Nest Hub does a much better job of displaying those services than Amazon’s options. Google also supports more video services than Amazon on its smart displays, including Disney Plus and Paramount Plus. You can also easily cast video content from a variety of apps on your phone, such as HBO Max, to the Nest Hub display, which you can’t do with an Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e57UYw"&gt;Like an Echo Show, the Nest Hub can be used to control smart home devices, display upcoming appointments, step-by-step recipes, or voice-controlled timers and alarms. Google Assistant is generally better at answering random fact-based questions than Alexa, but for everyday tasks, they are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NWMx8D"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MxM2OV"&gt;The best Alexa smart display for a bedroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CeMKuA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DbeQY"&gt;The Echo Show 5 is very similar to the Echo Show 8 but smaller. That makes it more ideal for a nightstand and the best Alexa smart display for your bedroom. It’s also the least expensive Echo Show model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh2NrA"&gt;The Show 5 only has a 5.5-inch screen, which isn’t as easy to see from across the room as larger models. It also only has a single speaker, which can get quite loud, but isn’t as good as the speaker systems in the bigger Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Kb9g8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="p2jUVQ"&gt;The Echo Show 5 also doesn’t support as many video streaming services or video calling services, and its 2-megapixel built-in camera is much lower quality than the Echo Show 8 or 10’s cameras. Fortunately, it still includes the physical privacy shutter to block its view when you don’t want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dlrt9"&gt;Where the Echo Show 5 really shines is on a nightstand or desk. If you’re using it as a smart alarm clock, you can tap on the top to snooze the alarm. On a desk, it works well for personal audio such as podcasts or to view feeds from a security camera or video doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gm2lYe"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock with Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mPth1E"&gt;The best Google smart alarm clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="k4KD9l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609486" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxh83d"&gt;If you are looking for a smart alarm clock with Google Assistant, then the best option is the tiny Lenovo Smart Clock. The Smart Clock has a 4-inch screen, no camera, and a small footprint, making it ideal for a nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj9wLb"&gt;The Smart Clock is capable of showing the time, weather, calendar appointments, and Google Photos albums, just like the larger Nest Hub displays. You can interact with the screen with either voice or touch, and there are buttons on top for controlling volume and a switch on the back for muting the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnZYEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lenovo Smart Clock review: a Google alarm clock","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PIGlOj"&gt;Though you can play all the same music services (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.) through the Smart Clock, its small speaker doesn’t sound that great and doesn’t get very loud. It works for hearing Google Assistant voice responses and an alarm, but not for extended listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXqjvT"&gt;In addition, you can tap the top of the Smart Clock to snooze an alarm, and there’s a USB port on the back that you can use to charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qZwK7s"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div id="okDdym"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TUHUo"&gt;Amazon’s biggest and most expensive smart display is the Echo Show 10. It’s the best option if you want an Amazon display for making video calls because it has a motorized base that can actually follow you as you move around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaRZHX"&gt;The 13-megapixel camera on the Echo Show 10 is the same as on the second-generation Echo Show 8. But its automatic crop and pan modes are supercharged by the 10’s motorized base. You can stick it in the corner of your kitchen and easily carry on a video call as you move around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXbws3"&gt;In addition, the motorized base makes it easy to watch video or follow a recipe as you move around since it always attempts to face you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yphYyV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 10 review: Alexa’s next move","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BWDxf0"&gt;The Echo Show 10 also has a louder and better-sounding speaker system than the smaller models, and it can fill a room with music easier. You can also pair smart home devices such as lightbulbs and other sensors directly to it through the built-in Zigbee radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eM7hMP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AmL7sb"&gt;The best Google smart display for video calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="2OgPBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rqdNQ"&gt;The 10-inch Nest Hub Max is a lot like the Nest Hub, but bigger. It also has a camera, though, which can be used for video calling through Google Duo or Zoom, or as a home security camera when you’re away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdyD44"&gt;The Max’s camera can also automatically crop and pan to keep you in frame, though it lacks the fancy motorized base found on the Echo Show 10. The camera also recognizes who is using the Max and automatically provides relevant information, and supports basic play and pause controls through hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qrm2JS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Hub Max review: bigger screen, better sound, and a camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zkm8Xt"&gt;The Max also has a louder, better-sounding speaker system than the smaller Nest Hub, which makes it more suitable for larger rooms. It’s probably too big to really use in a bedroom or on a nightstand — for that, you’ll want to stick with the smaller options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l33CZN"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal (10-inch&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdEmYr"&gt;The best smart display for Facebook users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ymW2g8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10594754" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvr7Fs"&gt;If you want a smart display specifically for making WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger calls, then the 10-inch Facebook Portal is your best option. It has a 13-megapixel camera that supports automatic panning and cropping, and it can be used for video calls on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Zoom, Cisco WebEx, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IuNRX"&gt;The Portal has Alexa as well, making it an Echo Show alternative. But the Alexa integration isn’t quite as good, and it doesn’t support as many features as Amazon’s smart display. You can also use Facebook’s own voice commands for controlling the Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CzOJUz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook Portal review: for Facebook fans","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="F78XAK"&gt;You can listen to music services or watch streaming video on the Portal’s 10-inch display, but the sound quality isn’t quite as good as you get on the Echo Show 8 or 10. If Facebook support is the most important thing to you, however, the Portal is a good choice. Otherwise, stick with an Amazon Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPO1bd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook develops new method to reverse-engineer deepfakes and track their source</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRYsijipK30guPArIn2XZ4QLQ5E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461351/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O57KgG"&gt;Deepfakes aren’t a big problem on Facebook right now, but the company continues to fund research into the technology to guard against future threats. Its latest work is a collaboration with academics from Michigan State University (MSU), with the combined team &lt;a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reverse-engineering-generative-model-from-a-single-deepfake-image/"&gt;creating a method to reverse-engineer deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;: analyzing AI-generated imagery to reveal identifying characteristics of the machine learning model that created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qC5BAJ"&gt;The work is useful as it could help Facebook track down bad actors spreading deepfakes on its various social networks. This content might include misinformation but also non-consensual pornography — a depressingly common application of deepfake technology. Right now, the work is still in the research stage and isn’t ready to be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kxaeCr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The method could help track down those spreading deepfakes online&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D44lJM"&gt;Previous studies in this area have been able to determine which known AI model generated a deepfake, but this work, led by MSU’s Vishal Asnani, goes a step further by identifying the architectural traits of unknown models. These traits, known as hyperparameters, have to be tuned in each machine learning model like parts in an engine. Collectively, they leave a unique fingerprint on the finished image that can then be used to identify its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k3jz6O"&gt;Identifying the traits of unknown models is important, Facebook research lead Tal Hassner tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; because deepfake software is extremely easy to customize. This potentially allows bad actors to cover their tracks if investigators were trying to trace their activity. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUP4x_ka_Sdh0TUVwyggW6-MA9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13762264/fake_ai_faces.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples of deepfakes include these fake faces, generated by a well-known AI model called StyleGAN.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1eUk7"&gt;“Let’s assume a bad actor is generating lots of different deepfakes and uploads them on different platforms to different users,” says Hassner. “If this is a new AI model nobody’s seen before, then there’s very little that we could have said about it in the past. Now, we’re able to say, ‘Look, the picture that was uploaded &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, the picture that was uploaded &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, all of them came from the same model.’ And if we were able to seize the laptop or computer [used to generate the content], we will be able to say, ‘This is the culprit.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3idLT"&gt;Hassner compares the work to forensic techniques used to identify &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-019-08182-z"&gt;which model of camera was used to take a picture&lt;/a&gt; by looking for patterns in the resulting image. “Not everybody can create their own camera, though,” he says. “Whereas anyone with a reasonable amount of experience and standard computer can cook their own model that generates deepfakes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDej1A"&gt;Not only can the resulting algorithm fingerprint the traits of a generative model, but it can also identify which known model created an image and whether an image is a deepfake in the first place. “On standard benchmarks, we get state-of-the-art results,” says Hassner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JXUXCd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Deepfake detection is still an “unsolved problem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VVUXFA"&gt;But it’s important to note that even these state-of-the-art results are far from reliable. When Facebook held a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21289164/facebook-deepfake-detection-challenge-unsolved-problem-ai"&gt;deepfake detection competition&lt;/a&gt; last year, the winning algorithm was only able to detect AI-manipulated videos 65.18 percent of the time. Researchers involved said that spotting deepfakes using algorithms is still very much an “unsolved problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXCSa1"&gt;Part of the reason for this is that the field of generative AI is extremely active. New techniques are published every day, and it’s nearly impossible for any filter to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c95rWk"&gt;Those involved in the field are keenly aware of this dynamic, and when asked if publishing this new fingerprinting algorithm will lead to research that can go undetected by these methods, Hassner agrees. “I would expect so,” he says. “This is a cat and mouse game, and it continues to be a cat and mouse game.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixar’s Luca is the perfect summer movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luca" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMLLnay6Zruvlr_TAQiaRtlWTAw=/388x0:3709x2214/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461377/84d02e02cfed107ee189b01d8ffd43b5_4096x2214_9372bd70.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DWlWiu"&gt;The best way to &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fluca%2F7K1HyQ6Hl16P&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDisneyPlusPixarLuca061621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;watch &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latest feature from Pixar, is when you’re that very particular kind of tired that comes from a long day at the beach. I recommend pulling out a projector so you can watch it outside, preferably as the sun starts to set, and ideally with some gelato to accompany you. What I’m saying is: this is just about the perfect summer movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WUzUR"&gt;Okay, sorry, so what is &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; actually? At its most basic, it’s a coming-of-age story about sea creatures, directed by Enrico Casarosa (who previously directed Pixar’s 2011 short &lt;em&gt;La Luna&lt;/em&gt;). Luca (Jacob Tremblay) is a young monster who lives a sheltered life on a family farm under the sea, largely oblivious to the human world above him. Most of what he knows comes from his parents, who tell him that the “land monsters” are “here to do murders.” Still, despite — or perhaps because of — this sense of danger, he’s fascinated by the human world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPzFwQ"&gt;He collects random objects, like playing cards and alarm clocks, and dreams about what the world outside of the ocean is like. (He’d make fast friends with Ariel.) Then one day, he meets another young monster named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer) who happens to live on the land. Luca’s budding obsession with the human world reaches its zenith when he spots a poster on Alberto’s wall that reads simply: “Vespa is freedom.” The two decide right then and there that they &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to have a Vespa.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Luca" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZkiz6k_UcOxlQNd-aXorbX60M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473688/LUCA_ONLINE_USE_v228_84_pub.pub16_CROP.133_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Pixar Animation Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uYKH4R"&gt;The big twist in &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; is that the sea monsters change into a human form when they’re out of the water. So Luca and Alberto are able to pretend to be human when they visit a nearby Italian seaside village in search of the scooter of their dreams. Eventually, they come up with a plan: with the help of a new human friend named Giulia they enter into a triathlon so that they can use the prize money to buy a Vespa. (In case you forgot the film takes place in Italy, one of the triathlon events is dedicated to eating pasta.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dtTnzK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10609516"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Scw5tW"&gt;The core of the movie is the budding friendship between Alberto and Luca. The two are near polar opposites. Luca, cautious yet imaginative; Alberto, brash and prone to taking risks. They push each other in different ways. Alberto helps Luca out of his shell with daring bike rides and other stunts, while Luca shows Alberto that there’s more to life than just having fun. For the most part, &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;’s story follows the expected beats. The two grow close, eventually clash, and struggle to deal with the influence of Giulia on their relationship. They adapt to the human world as they train for the competition — Luca learns how to ride a bike, while Alberto struggles to operate a fork — and discover new pleasures like gelato. At the same time, there’s a constant sense of danger; any time it rains you worry that the boys will be found out, which is particularly scary given how much the villagers hate sea monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBCvn2"&gt;But the predictable nature of&lt;em&gt; Luca&lt;/em&gt; never bothered me, because it’s just so charming. There’s a real tactile sensation to the animation. The rippling effect when a sea monster transforms into a person is jarring yet almost satisfying, like popping a piece of bubble wrap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rksLfX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYfJxlgR2jw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TWuZ4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; has the vibe of a stop-motion production, with exaggerated characters that look like they’re made of toothpicks and plasticine. It all helps add to the movie’s cozy nature. At the same time, because this is a CG film, there’s a fluidity, particularly when you see the sea creatures swimming like otters. (The water looks incredibly lifelike.) Seeing the pair of friends race through the water, jumping like dolphins, and changing forms constantly in the process, creates an incredible sense of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDTWuO"&gt;Perhaps the most impressive thing about &lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;is that it features two fully realized worlds. The quaint, sun-drenched village looks like a 1950s postcard come to life and just makes you want to laze around in the sun for a few hours. Yet Pixar has an uncanny ability to imagine the details of hidden worlds, whether that’s the lives of toys or the land of the dead — or, in this case, the day-to-day experience of sea monsters. You’ll see Luca shepherding fish on a farm, and his father doting over crabs ahead of a Westminster-like competition. When Luca’s trips to the surface are discovered, his parents threaten to send him to live in the deep sea with his translucent anglerfish uncle. Instead of presenting the sea monsters as strange or terrifying, they’re immediately shown as humanity’s underwater counterparts. Just, you know, with purple gills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyvd6S"&gt;Like many Pixar films, &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly groundbreaking. This is a family-friendly story that’s largely easy to predict. But that doesn’t take anything away from the big emotional beats. When the boys fight, it’s tragic to watch. When they help a lonely Giulia discover friendship, it warms your heart. The story wraps up with a very neat and tidy message about acceptance, and yet I couldn’t help but feel a little weepy at the end. &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; sets a very particular mood, and it’s one that fits right in with a warm summer night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwFEKn"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luca &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres on Disney Plus on June 18th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mGm34V"&gt;Father’s Day is only a few days away, but if you’re starting to panic — don’t. We know that finding a good gift for Father’s Day can be really difficult — especially with all those “traditional” dad gifts out there that are just, well, boring. So this year, we’ve looked around for some special, interesting gifts for dad in a wide range of types and prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iwogd"&gt;We’ve got a bunch of stuff for the do-it-yourselfer: a Leatherman multitool, the ultimate gardening tool, and a whiskey- and rum-making kit. For the tech enthusiast, we’ve got a VR device, a gaming mouse, and a mini electric screwdriver set. And for the lovers of quirk, we offer a New York City brunch, a desk toy that can form a dodecahedron, and a subscription for two vinyl records a month, among a load of other great gift ideas. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="NZJH6Z"&gt;Google’s Chromecast has always been a low-cost method for streaming your favorite apps on your TV. Its new interface makes it easy to find and subscribe to all of your favorite programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BkLDmx"&gt;The Apple TV 4K is a great TV box for sharing photos, watching videos, and playing music for a party. Sure, it’s a bit of an expensive gift, but this is a shiny new version. And even better, it has a new remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cPeHX2"&gt;This powered screwdriver with dozens of bits is an indispensable tool for anyone who likes taking apart gadgets or small electronics. This one also comes with a handy magnetic mat for organizing screws. It’s perfect for when dad wants to upgrade the RAM in his gaming laptop. (If the ABLY is out of stock, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wowstick-Electric-Screwdriver-Portable-Chargeable/dp/B07GCL5ZM2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergefathersday2021-20&amp;amp;linkId=8e34eb2103d43ec9732553e780791a5f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wowstick 1F Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative for the same price.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="64vDXB"&gt;A smartwatch is a great gift. If dad is an Apple person, the Apple Watch SE will help him track his exercise, keep in touch, listen to tunes — and even tell the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEgjgE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1068592/7613?sharedid=VergeFather%27sDayGiftGuide042921&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-watch-se%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$329 at APPLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5bs9Zx"&gt;If dad’s an Android user, the Ticwatch Pro 3 is a good-looking watch that should take care of everything he needs in a smartwatch. According to our reviewer, it takes Wear OS as far as it can go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eSLOjk"&gt;It’s fun to game with others, but sometimes it’s even better to slip off into your own little virtual world. The Oculus Quest 2 is a smart purchase if dad wants to explore virtual environments or get sweaty moving to the music in &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo’s rollable concept phone is pure potential lacking polish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/td2nqlX7F45OVr3-qrdFdSELt60=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69461161/akrales_20210604_4621_07.0.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But no sign of a commercial release&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="JHp5O3"&gt;Two hundred thousand. That’s the magic number of times Oppo wants its rollable X 2021 concept phone to be able to expand and contract before it’ll consider it durable enough to turn into a commercial device. That’s 200,000 times the device will need to be able to transform from a 6.7-inch phone into a 7.4-inch mini tablet, and 200,000 times it’ll need to successfully contract back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v44URM"&gt;But as it stands, Oppo says the Oppo X 2021 is durable enough to manage just half that, at 100,000 cycles. In theory, that’s already enough for around five and a half years of use if you open and close it 50 times a day, but as we’ve seen with early foldable devices, these figures sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411510/samsung-galaxy-fold-broken-screen-debris-dust-hinge-flexible-bulge"&gt;don’t translate into the real world&lt;/a&gt;. The number shows the scale of the work Oppo still has to do on its concept, which it unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;last November&lt;/a&gt; during its second annual “Inno Day” celebration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1DKwlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Oppo wants it to be durable enough to survive 200,000 transformations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vnx2QA"&gt;In durability terms, Oppo thinks it’s halfway toward turning its rollable phone from a concept into reality. But after having spent an afternoon using the company’s prototype device for myself, it’s clear that hitting this arbitrary number is far from the only challenge Oppo is facing in bringing this device to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEbDMH"&gt;At first glance, the Oppo X 2021 looks like a regular 6.7-inch smartphone, designed to do everything you’d expect a regular smartphone to be able to do. But at the tap of a button, the phone starts to whir and unroll its display to 7.4 inches in size, bringing it closer to the form factor of a small tablet. Similar concepts have been announced by competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;ranging from LG&lt;/a&gt; (prior to its announcement that it’s quitting the smartphone industry) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225446/tcl-rollable-phone-extendable-display-concepts-ces2021"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first such functional device we’ve actually been able to try out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ZEGdci"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10609222"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZtRAz"&gt;It’s a cool magic trick, so naturally there’s a series of complicated mechanisms working behind the scenes to make it all possible. That whirring sound is coming from a pair of motors inside the X 2021, which are expanding the phone’s dynamic frame into its full size. Meanwhile, the screen itself is rolling around the left hand side of the phone, curving around a 6.8mm axis that Oppo says allows the screen to unroll with “virtually no trace.” Behind this screen are a series of metal slats, which slot together to support the screen regardless of whether it’s expanded or contracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWth97"&gt;There’s a lot going on inside the phone, which puts the overall device on the heavier, bulkier side. Held next to my own iPhone 12 Pro, the Oppo X 2021 is thicker at 10.7mm compared to 7.4mm, and heavier at 278g (compared to 189g). That’s a substantial difference, but it’s in a similar ballpark to existing plus-sized devices on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RSIILO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A bigger screen for gaming, reading, or watching a film&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h5rzzd"&gt;A transformation from 6.7 inches to 7.4 inches might not sound like too big a change, but it’s much larger when you consider the phone’s aspect ratio is also changing. You start with a roughly 19.85:9 widescreen display (with a resolution of 1175 x 2592) and end with a screen that’s got an aspect ratio closer to 4:3 (or 4.36:3 to be exact, 1785 x 2592). Effectively, it turns into a device that’s just a tad smaller than a 7.9-inch iPad Mini. It might not be enough to turn it into a productivity powerhouse, but it’s enough to make watching films, gaming, reading, or looking up a map a less cramped experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCeXDf"&gt;On the face of it, it’s a similar promise to the one the likes of Samsung and Huawei have made with their foldable phones, wrapped up in an even more unproven form factor. But Oppo’s approach has a number of theoretical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSUqPy"&gt;For starters, Oppo’s rollable design means the telltale crease that has sat along the middle of every foldable released so far is all but absent from the X 2021. Look closely and you’ll spot a slight rumple on the left hand side of the screen, but it’s barely visible, even when the phone is showing a mainly black image. We’ve long held that the creases found on foldable devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt; aren’t nearly as much of a problem once you’re actually using the device, but that’s not much consolation when you’re spending over $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2i7aHz3ogG8lqH-32INWGKhsrBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657752/akrales_20210604_4621_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slight imperfection can be see on the screen while unrolled...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iF_pBRLQul-2u0ZYIghTPIEXmRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657749/akrales_20210604_4621_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... but it’s much less obvious when the screen is turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykq2Q4"&gt;The X 2021’s minimal crease is thanks to the fact the screen doesn’t need to bend anywhere near as sharply as it rolls round the edge of the phone. Oppo says the screen’s bend radius is 6.8mm, a comparatively gentle curve. The Oppo X 2021 currently uses a plastic display, but this radius leaves the door open for the company to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;folding glass in future iterations&lt;/a&gt; (one manufacturer, Schott, says its glass can be bent at a radius of under 5mm). However, Oppo would not reveal any firm plans to use folding glass in future models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ai1oPv"&gt;There’s also the fact that a rollable design gives you access to a lot more potential screen sizes than a folding one. Its maximum and minimum sizes will always be the same, but there’s no reason it couldn’t stop expanding at the 7.2, 7, or 6.8-inch mark. Similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524338/lg-rollable-tv-available-price-on-sale-korea"&gt;LG’s rollable TV&lt;/a&gt;, the phone could theoretically adapt to different aspect ratios, rather than leaving you with unsightly black bars while you’re playing a game or watching a film at a specific aspect ratio. But none of this functionality was available on the prototype I used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cneoi"&gt;That’s not to say that a rollable design doesn’t come with its own tradeoffs. The most obvious of these is that unlike a foldable, which lets you open up its display as quickly as a book, Oppo’s device takes the better part of two or three seconds to fully extend. It felt slow enough that you might not bother if you were in a hurry to check map directions. The company admits its electric motors also introduce another potential point of failure, which would need to be solved ahead of a commercial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/biwz-hmrvJTdjjOkjRQYnOA7EZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657750/akrales_20210604_4621_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s USB-C charging port saw a lot of use during the demonstration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DccVXm8Fvahd6qR1LSi56Gvs23E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657753/akrales_20210604_4621_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oppo X 2021 (right) vs an iPhone 12 Pro (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d55Leo"&gt;There’s also the question of what effect having these motors inside a phone will have on its battery life. During my demonstration (which, granted, involved repeatedly expanding and contracting the phone in a way you’d never do in normal usage), the X 2021 needed to be recharged more than once. It was a prototype, which wouldn’t have any of the battery optimizations of a consumer product, but it’s still unclear what effect these motors could have on the eventual device’s battery life in more normal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20Yccv"&gt;Beyond simple practical concerns like these, there are also questions about whether Android is equipped to deal with devices with changing display sizes. When we reviewed Samsung’s latest foldable, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, last September, we found that the company effectively had to build a completely new layer of software on top of Android to make its foldable device work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrLitJ"&gt;Oppo has ambitious plans for the X 2021’s software. The prototype runs Oppo’s ColorOS fork of Android and is able to run dual apps side by side, or display two windows of the same app to make use of the extra screen real estate. But so far, most of these features are limited to Oppo’s own built-in apps, and it’s still working with third-party developers to get them to enable support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0od3HV9ydpZHToWtxSEB4rsODcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657751/akrales_20210604_4621_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone gives few hints about the device’s flagship feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DujENx"&gt;Oppo is making no attempt to hide the fact that its X 2021 concept is a work in progress. The device I used lacked many of the basic features you’d expect out of a modern smartphone. There was no biometric security, no selfie camera, and adjusting the device’s volume involved awkwardly tapping the side of the display in the absence of physical volume buttons. Even its flagship feature, the rolling, was a bit clumsy and unpredictable — you’re supposed to be able to expand and contract the phone with a simple swipe, but I could only reliably get it to work with a double tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJBLh4"&gt;But even as an in-development device, Oppo’s X 2021 represents one of the most advanced rollables we’ve seen. TCL may have announced a similar device, but at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;last hands-on event&lt;/a&gt; its prototype was nonfunctional. Oppo’s prototype might be light on both hardware and software features, with an unproven level of durability, and a finicky transforming process. Ultimately, though, it fundamentally does the thing Oppo promised it’d do, and the company is happy to let press handle the device in a way that its competitors have yet to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TgePAY"&gt;In an industry that’s dominated by increasingly anonymous black rectangles, it’s hard not to root for new form factors like the one Oppo is showing off with the X 2021. Now it needs to actually make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anMWyF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
