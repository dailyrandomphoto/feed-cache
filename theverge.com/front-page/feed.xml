    <title>Android 13’s dessert codename might be Tiramisu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Voraciously Essentials Tiramisu" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AUfZyEr7n2IcGE8un-OhlxZ1yMc=/0x35:6048x4067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69637354/1228334198.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="roF0an"&gt;Tiramisu is a deliciously simple Italian dessert made from coffee-infused ladyfingers and whipped mascarpone and/or cream, but it could also be the internal codename for the next version of Android. That’s if a new commit &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-android-13-t-tiramisu-dessert-name/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed. “Rename T to Tiramisu,” &lt;a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/+/1778625"&gt;the note reads&lt;/a&gt;, in what &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;notes is the first public mention of a dessert-based codename for Android 13, expected to release next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkFURg"&gt;Up until Android 10, each version of Google’s mobile OS had both a version number and a dessert-based name, which progressed alphabetically with each new release. Android 4 was Ice Cream Sandwich, 4.1 was Jelly Bean, 4.4 was KitKat, and so on. But Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827231/android-10-q-google-name-officially-announced-new-logo-wordmark-desserts"&gt;dropped the dessert names with Android 10&lt;/a&gt;, when it was in the unenviable position of having to come up with a dessert starting with the letter “Q.” Since then, the public names of each Android release have only been numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZZ5UtI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Following Red Velvet Cake and Snow Cone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bZtwAx"&gt;Internally, however, Google has continued to use dessert names for each new Android version. Android 10 was internally &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/08/28/android-10-team-interview/#:~:text=Canada.-,Android%2010%20is%20known,Just,-because"&gt;known as “Quince Tart,”&lt;/a&gt; Android 11 was “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/7/23/21336209/android-11-r-red-velvet-cake-internal-code-name-dessert-google"&gt;Red Velvet Cake&lt;/a&gt;,” and Android 12, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;currently in beta&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its release this fall, is apparently “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284545/android-12-dessert-name-snow-cone-start-with-s"&gt;Snow Cone.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvL5Eh"&gt;I’m not a massive fan of tiramisu the dessert, but Tiramisu the Android name? That’s something I can get behind. “Turkish Delight” is a little too long for a name, and “Twix” would just feel like a rebrand of KitKat. That said, I would have also accepted “Toffee,” “Treacle Tart,” “Trifle,” “Truffles,” or… wow, is anyone else getting uncomfortably hungry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y61sm9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oyc58Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2Ma3J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme is the first to bring magnetic wireless charging to Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RmlaYRbiayre2gsOyyEK7hVgxs=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69637282/rmf.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A leaked image of the upcoming Realme Flash and its MagDart magnetic charger | GSMArena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tC2r8M"&gt;Realme has teased a new device called the Realme Flash, which it claims will be the first Android phone to use magnetic wireless charging. While it looks to be the company’s take on Apple’s MagSafe system for the iPhone 12 range, Realme is taking a somewhat different approach with the initial hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxGVx9"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/exclusive_realme_flash_is_the_first_android_phone_with_magnetic_wireless_charging-news-50232.php"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Realme will release a magnetic wireless charger called MagDart that’s far bulkier than Apple’s MagSafe puck. Charging speeds are said to exceed the 15W that MagSafe reaches, making it the fastest magnetic charger in the world, but the tradeoff is that the device is much thicker and requires an active cooling fan. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zLPolC1NORcTTKMk2ztuZWolzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742663/202107212204175.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An alleged Realme MagDart charger.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0MYogC"&gt;Realme is also working on a slimmer MagDart charger that looks much more like Apple’s MagSafe puck, &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/07/21/exclusive-first-look-realme-magdart-chargers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p78cNv"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;, the Realme Flash will be a flagship phone with a Snapdragon 888 processor. A leaked render of the phone shows that at least one model will have 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. Sources with knowledge of Realme’s plans tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s likely to be announced next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKz04y"&gt;Realme has never included wireless charging in any of its phones before, though it does sell Qi wireless chargers that work with accessories like earbuds. It took many years for sister brand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21218741/oppo-ace-2-wireless-charging-airvooc-announced-china-price"&gt;Oppo to use the technology,&lt;/a&gt; after focusing on the proprietary VOOC wired fast-charge system that was also adopted as Dash Charge in several OnePlus phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify adds What’s New feed for all the music and podcasts you follow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l0aQO4qIUXji8382m-IVlSxdHxI=/1x0:1089x725/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69637230/msedge_HCpikuephw.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A blue icon will indicate when new content has released.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6AWwlq"&gt;What’s New is a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-26/spotifys-whats-new-feed-means-youll-never-miss-the-latest-releases-from-the-shows-and-artists-you-follow/"&gt;new section in the Spotify app&lt;/a&gt; that collects together new music and content from musicians and podcasts you follow on the platform. The feed, which is rolling out globally over the coming weeks on iOS and Android, will be accessible via a new bell icon on the top right of the app’s home screen. A blue dot will show when there’s new content in the feed, and artists and podcasts can be added by tapping the “Follow” button on their respective pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMU7vJ"&gt;“What’s New makes it easier than ever to catch all the latest songs and episodes from the creators you follow,” Spotify’s announcement says. “Plus, it’s even updated in real time, so you know you’ll get to listen to new content just as it’s released.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKRw2F-xxM0BzaU4T3pCMw71Awk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22742664/spotify_new_feed.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s What’s New section of the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1OlCa"&gt;Although the new feature works with music releases, the feed is likely to be most helpful for keeping up to date with podcasts. Despite Spotify’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18243729/spotify-podcast-strategy-gimlet-media-anchor-purchase"&gt;big push into podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, its history as a music-focused service has meant that its apps aren’t particularly well suited for listening to episodic content. Dedicated podcasting apps, meanwhile, are designed around chronological feeds, making it easy to see when new episodes are available. Hopefully, What’s New will bring some of these benefits to Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Odyssey Neo G9 is a high-end TV disguised as a 49-inch curved gaming monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_AWJWsXe1Qu_q9a8LG65IeBRRKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636565/cfaulkner_210720_4672_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s the same size as last year, but with plenty of changes behind the panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKllEr"&gt;Samsung’s follow-up to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;excellent Odyssey G9 curved gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt; is nearly here: the 49-inch Odyssey Neo G9 will cost a staggering $2,499.99 when it goes on preorder starting Thursday, July 29th. That’s nearly $1,000 more than the original, but this isn’t just a simple bump. The new Neo G9 now has a Mini LED backlit panel that can hit 2,000 nits of brightness, with full-array local dimming for the kind of deeper blacks and convincing HDR that the original didn’t quite manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="25VBbi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;intense brightness, deep color, enveloping curve&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msA0dP"&gt;I recently had the enviable opportunity to test out the Odyssey Neo G9 with &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and the thing that stood out to me the most — aside from practically being enveloped in its 1000R curve — was the intense brightness of the display. Whether I was looking at the hazy skyline in Night City or staring at the hellish color palette as I ripped through demons, I was impressed by a lot of things at once: how clean the contrast appeared even as I whipped the mouse around, and how rich some of the deeper colors appeared. The desktop connected to the monitor didn’t come close to taking advantage of its 240Hz refresh rate (you’ll need a very capable machine to get the most out of this monitor), but it was still an enjoyable, immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YfMWG"&gt;Like last year’s Odyssey G9, the Odyssey Neo G9 is a 49-inch curved monitor with a 5120 x 1440 resolution (it’s like two QHD displays smashed together), but several key specs have been improved, and Samsung is aligning this high-end gaming monitor with its Neo series of high-end TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl8fZv"&gt;Mini LED is definitely the highlight: it helps the Odyssey Neo G9 display light scenes more accurately and give deeper blacks less bloom than traditional LED backlighting. In addition to that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/12/16767160/vesa-displayhdr-specification-screen-monitor-hdr10-400-600-1000-standard"&gt;peak luminance of 2000 nits, or 2000 cd/m²&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung says it boosted the amount of local dimming zones to 2,048 compared to just 10 in last year’s model. It also supports HDR 10 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrsCWDhylOBpEhO7GmOdl1VsnvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729201/cfaulkner_210720_4672_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m1EVc6"&gt;Another new trick that’s more subtle, but still welcome, is the CoreSync feature that can sync the monitor’s rear-facing light with what’s happening in-game for deeper immersion. It can apparently do this without having to install an app, though Samsung notes that you probably won’t notice the effect unless you’re in a dark room and the monitor is right up against the wall. (Note: the blue light behind the monitor in these images isn’t being emitted from the Odyssey Neo G9’s rear light. It’s a light that Samsung installed at the press briefing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aH61c7"&gt;The Odyssey Neo G9 is Nvidia G-Sync compatible and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and variable refresh rate (VRR). It retains the same 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time of last year’s model — no quibbles there. But Samsung also upgraded the two HDMI ports in the Odyssey Neo G9 to the newer 2.1 standard that offers enough bandwidth to allow your PC to take full advantage of its fast refresh rate and resolution over HDMI. That’s good, considering that last year’s monitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;had to pull some Display Stream Compression tricks to make 240Hz work over DisplayPort&lt;/a&gt;, which didn’t play nice with the newest AMD and Nvidia graphics cards at their debut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeQMPS"&gt;Having HDMI 2.1 with VRR also means that this monitor will support faster refresh rates from consoles down the line, should those updates happen. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/2/16597100/xbox-one-x-1440p-support-confirmed"&gt;Xbox Series X supports 1440p at 120Hz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/display-sound/4k-gaming-at-120hz"&gt;up to 4K&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383288/sony-ps5-update-hdr-options-120hz-pc-monitor-support-features"&gt;PS5 currently supports 1080p at a 120Hz refresh rate&lt;/a&gt;. The Odyssey Neo G9 also features one DisplayPort 1.4 port with adaptive sync, along with a headphone jack and two USB 3.0 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G9" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U1tbXGRAmFpJELgbEZErjOaLuX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740574/odysseyneog9ports.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the port layout on the Odyssey Neo G9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O32Gwi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;Like my colleague Sean Hollister noted in his review of last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, games can still look warped around the edges in this 32:9 aspect ratio screen. I noticed this in both titles that I tried out, but hopefully more games will get proper super-ultrawide monitor support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan"&gt;like the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’d really love to see that game running on the Neo G9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yC3E3K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Odyssey G9 review: the most immersive monitor you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YXmjAo"&gt;That $2,499.99 price, though. It’s clear this monitor is for enthusiast gamers who value the curved design over other advantages that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;some of the best OLED TVs and other high-end models bring these days&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s impossible to ignore that at this point, you can get a bigger OLED screen with similar features and specs, plus 4K resolution, for a similar price — or lower. The sticker shock may not be lost on Samsung, either, as it’s including a free &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207459/jbl-quantum-one-headset-vr-binaural-audio-pc"&gt;JBL Quantum One head-tracking gaming headset&lt;/a&gt; with preorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3qhSI"&gt;The Odyssey Neo G9 will ship globally August 9th, and we’ll be taking a closer look at this monitor then. For now, here are a few more photos that I was able to snap at Samsung’s event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucasfilm hires the YouTube deepfaker who put its Luke, Leia and Tarkin cameos to shame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FZnTI1GXA_sXSQTo_QhyInx9WA=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636485/wrHXA2cSpNU_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AUoS5e"&gt;I recently re-watched &lt;em&gt;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. &lt;/em&gt;It mostly held up — except for Lucasfilm’s attempt to bring Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin back to the big screen using CGI. That’s something that only bugged me the tiniest bit the first time I watched it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g43C1t"&gt;But Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light and Magic may now have the ability to make those movies a tad more futureproof, because it’s hired a YouTuber who specializes in deepfaking Star Wars and other big-budget movies, showing up their CGI de-aging techniques. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Shamook/videos"&gt;Shamook&lt;/a&gt; is the one who “fixed” Luke Skywalker’s cameo in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrHXA2cSpNU"&gt;to the tune of 1.9 million videos&lt;/a&gt;, and the improvements to &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;’s Tarkin are phenomenal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YZ6RMx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_CXMb_MO3aw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xWqkbq"&gt;Peter Cushing was certainly thin in the role, but he no longer looks quite so emaciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUBpVI"&gt;Instead of ordering YouTube to yank the content or sending cease-and-desists, &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/lucasfilm-hires-deepfake-youtuber-mandalorian-skywalker-vfx-1234653720/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IndieWire&lt;/em&gt; now reports&lt;/a&gt; Lucasfilm decided to hire Shamook instead to do what they apparently love. “[Industrial Light and Magic is] always on the lookout for talented artists and have in fact hired the artist that goes by the online persona ‘Shamook,’” a Lucasfilm representative told &lt;em&gt;IndieWire (&lt;/em&gt;via&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/lucasfilm-hires-deepfake-youtuber-who-fixed-the-mandalorian/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; “Over the past several years ILM has been investing in both machine learning and A.I. as a means to produce compelling visual effects work and it’s been terrific to see momentum building in this space as the technology advances.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnZSta"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmuYz0aZGgU&amp;amp;lc=UgwIZs7NpWc0EdjFK_x4AaABAg.9PVaOaYLW4Q9PVxN9E78kp"&gt;In the YouTube comments&lt;/a&gt; on a recent video, Shamook says their new title is “Senior Facial Capture Artist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbWkQX"&gt;I’m not sure Shamook’s results are always better than the originals; many still have that uncanny, mask-like quality that’s still common to a lot of deepfakes today, and they don’t have the benefit of all the additional CG lighting work that clearly went into Disney’s modern films and shows. But perhaps by combining ideas, they can reach new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyQZDt"&gt;Shamook also has a penchant for swapping stars, famously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC3uH4Xw4Xo"&gt;inserting Harrison Ford into &lt;em&gt;Solo: A Star Wars Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYXVvz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dml9Ev"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmQNeQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 14.7.1 to fix Apple Watch unlocking and a zero-day exploit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfFs8B_cRUHExgR7l5FZtQuuAbs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636290/DSC02729_dbohn_verge.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="60Z4kK"&gt;Last week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583871/apple-ios-14-7-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-ipad-timers-apple-card"&gt;iOS 14.7&lt;/a&gt; appeared, adding features including support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;magnetic battery pack&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212615"&gt;the update also interrupted&lt;/a&gt; the “Unlock with iPhone” feature that Apple Watch wearers used for easy access to their wristwear. Now, another update is going out to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hANNgW"&gt;However, even if you don’t have an Apple Watch, you should still install iOS 14.7.1 (and for Mac owners, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212622"&gt;macOS 11.5.1&lt;/a&gt;) as soon as you can, because &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212623"&gt;security notes&lt;/a&gt; from Apple reveal that the two updates it pushed today fix flaws that are already being exploited in the wild. The memory corruption issues in Apple’s desktop and mobile operating systems have been assigned the same vulnerability ID and attributed to an anonymous researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="umn7rg"&gt;IOMobileFrameBuffer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBbHJd"&gt;Available for: iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaZwfg"&gt;Available for: macOS Big Sur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARVC7L"&gt;Impact: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6cSVB"&gt;Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved memory handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RahuVG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30807"&gt;CVE-2021-30807&lt;/a&gt;: an anonymous researcher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wiMhgM"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/apple-patches-actively-exploited-mac-ios-security-flaw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is the 13th zero-day vulnerability Apple has fixed this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parking lots and airports don’t count for rural broadband funding, FCC tells SpaceX</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Mobile World Congress 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6tZZG3_ft2KXzAY7ACCgR49m9uk=/0x0:1552x1035/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636145/1233721222.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OlT3fd"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission told SpaceX and other companies on Monday that the billions in rural broadband subsidies it doled out last year can’t be used in already connected areas like “parking lots and well-served urban areas,” citing complaints. The commission, in an effort to “clean up” its subsidy auction program, offered the companies a chance to rescind their funding requests from areas that already have service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJ8GN0"&gt;The companies that got the subsidies must do the work to determine they qualify for the money, wrote Michael Janson, director of the FCC’s Rural Broadband Task Force, in a letter addressed to SpaceX’s finance director David Finlay. Similar letters, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/spacex-challenged-by-u-s-fcc-on-bid-for-rural-broadband-subsidy?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;first reported by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, were sent to other recipients of the commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, a $9.2 billion auction to expand broadband into rural areas that lack or have no service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pivzga"&gt;SpaceX’s satellite internet network Starlink won $886 million last December as part of the RDOF program, with 196 other companies also getting a chunk of the $9.2 billion. After the awards, reports from organizations like Competitive Carriers Association, an advocacy group, highlighted widespread flaws and waste with the FCC’s approach. “Pervasive errors in broadband data will soon send hundreds of millions of dollars of Federal broadband subsidies to areas of the country least in need of support,” &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1050650786049/FINAL%20CCA%20Ex%20Parte%20%26%20White%20Paper%20-%2005.06.2021%20(clean).pdf"&gt;a May CCA report said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgTd29"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/insights-opinions/space-x-broadband-coming-empty-traffic-island-near-you"&gt;Another report from Free Press&lt;/a&gt;, a media policy organization, found that over $700 million of RDOF funds were being spent to deploy broadband to areas that already have it, calling the rural internet program “riddled with errors, waste and insufficient oversight.” $111 million of SpaceX’s $886 million share, the report found, was going to well-served urban areas and random patches of land with no infrastructure, from thin highway medians and empty patches of grass to New York City parking lots and big-box stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NptXSt"&gt;The RDOF subsidies were announced under former FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican who left office when President Biden became president. Free Press had criticized the RDOF program under Pai’s leadership and lauded Rosenworcel’s oversight after the letters were distributed to RDOF companies on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s XR20 is a rugged 5G phone with three years of OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EWk9zLOuML5RGakjFRGFx3rkU9Q=/0x70:1646x1167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636026/Nokia_XR20_Workshop__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 includes a 6.67-inch screen and dual rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD Global&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMNx1D"&gt;HMD Global’s newest Nokia device is the XR20, a rugged phone with 5G connectivity that goes on sale in late August for $549. In addition to robust physical protection, the XR20 is well supported on the software side — a big focus for Nokia’s latest devices — as it ships with Android 11 and comes with three years of OS upgrades alongside four years of monthly security updates. Even considering that the first of those updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, is due for release very soon, it’s a policy that’s far stronger than that of most midrange Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUPJRp"&gt;The XR20 has a long list of rugged specs. It’s IP68 rated and can withstand submersion in 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) of water for up to an hour. It also meets other criteria of the MIL-STD 810H standard, like the ability to withstand temperatures from 131° F (55° C) down to -7.6° F (-22° C) and protection against drops from up to 5.9 feet (1.8 meters). Its screen uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Gorilla Glass Victus&lt;/a&gt;, which Nokia boasts is the “toughest screen yet” on one of its smartphones. You can also take comfort in the fact that the phone comes with a two-year extended warranty in the US (three years in the UK). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_F_Ou9mvWc9EIhWZI49TtryylQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22737064/Nokia_XR20_Hero_Image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XR20 meets rugged specifications for water submersion, drops, and extreme temperatures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7Mdl4"&gt;Beyond its rugged credentials, the Nokia XR20 bears many similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;the non-rugged X20&lt;/a&gt;, starting with its 6.67-inch 1080p screen. It skips the X20’s macro and depth sensors, offering just two rear-facing cameras: a 48-megapixel f/1.79 main and a 13-megapixel f/2.4 ultrawide. Internally, it’s equipped with a Snapdragon 480 processor along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, a combination we found to be adequate with some occasional hiccups in the X20. There’s a 4,630mAh battery and Qi wireless charging is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vZ3ag"&gt;In terms of raw hardware specs, it’s not positioned to challenge the very best midrange phones like the Samsung A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G (making way for the 5A soon), which tracks with Nokia’s recent emphasis on value-driven devices. The X20’s camera didn’t impress us, and the Snapdragon 480 chipset likely won’t provide best-in-class performance, but the XR20 could potentially fill a gap in the market for an affordable, mainstream rugged device with healthy software support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxnldw"&gt;The 6GB RAM / 128GB storage variant will be the only one sold in the US, with availability starting August 24th. That version will sell for £449 in the UK, where a 4GB RAM / 64GB storage option will also be available for £399. Both will be available in the UK from July 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIZ8HznVWT8VZaeJIACzXGi8NCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741417/Nokia_C30___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia C30 includes a huge 6,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dt6AkU"&gt;Nokia C30, Nokia 6310 feature phone, and Clarity Earbuds Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="x6p5hg"&gt;HMD is also announcing a couple of other devices for global release: the Nokia C30 and Nokia 6310. The C30 is a big-screen, big-battery affair, with a huge 6.82-inch panel — Nokia’s largest to date — and a 6,000mAh battery. A version with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage will go on sale in the UK in September for £99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3tLxLATVgQFcA_SNbugAPyHjBNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741432/TWS_841W_BKGY_A01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ruxRR1"&gt;The Clarity Earbuds Pro include active noise cancellation, are IPX5 sweat and water-resistant, and offer up to nine hours of use on a single charge (seven with ANC enabled). The included case supplies an additional 36 hours of use without ANC or 28 hours with it enabled. They’ll go on sale in the UK in September for £99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rosKMgq11gQKIA412LQLXCgxv_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741425/Nokia_6310___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD Global&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia 6310 features basic 2G connectivity and emphasizes accessibility. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a2pzKM"&gt;Finally, the Nokia 6310 is a 2G-only phone designed with accessibility in mind, including larger buttons and fonts, and users can have texts read aloud. It goes on sale in the UK in August for £49.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung confirms Z Fold 3 S Pen support as Note line is in limbo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Unpacked invitation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mD9JkOpc9idzrzfST51xY0Zj__o=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69636009/unpacked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung Unpacked invitation | Samsunng&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcbyYm"&gt;Samsung isn’t looking to have many surprises at its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;August 11th Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;. Leaks have already revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;Galaxy smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;new Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Samsung mobile president TM Roh is continuing a recent tradition of &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/unfold-next-era-of-smartphone-innovation/"&gt;publishing a pre-event blog post&lt;/a&gt; that confirms some news, sets expectations, and hints at some additional details. Roh promises improved durability for folding screens, stylus support, and that Samsung will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; release a new Note phone this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rqEbz"&gt;Although the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Unpacked invitation pictured above&lt;/a&gt; didn’t leave much to the imagination, Roh simply comes out and says there will be new foldables this year: “Our third generation of foldable devices will open up amazing new multitasking capabilities and enhanced durability,” he writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPq2rq"&gt;The key phrase to pay attention to there is “enhanced durability,” a theme Roh hits on again when he touches on the Z Flip 3, writing that it will have “an even more refined style, armed with more durable, stronger materials.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rwygvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung promises “more durable, stronger materials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6HrLzz"&gt;Each successive iteration of Samsung’s folding phones has improved screen durability — starting from the total debacle of the first canceled product on through a refined plastic screen and finally “Ultra Thin Glass.” It’s as yet unclear what exactly Samsung will do to improve durability further, but there’s absolutely still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s&amp;amp;t=621s"&gt;room to improve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSh29p"&gt;A recent leak shows that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case"&gt;two folding phones may have IPX8 water resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which could be part of this durability story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rMl0V"&gt;Durability is a vital spec for folding phones, but it will be doubly important for the upcoming Z Fold 3, which Roh confirms will have stylus support. It may not work with the existing S Pens that are designed for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, however, as Roh indicates that Samsung will announce “the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2GJ3V"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-s-pen-case-renders-exclusive/"&gt;recent leak at &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that there will be a case for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 that will have a place to store the new S Pen, slotted directly in the middle behind the hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Df-Rb3lQUoCWfx8LGvHu7TVAxSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22741284/Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold3_Samsung_S_Pen_case_render_03.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaked Galaxy Z Fold 3 case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gXEKFS"&gt;Roh is also setting another expectation: there won’t be a Galaxy Note announced this year, writing: “instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTCuzn"&gt;Samsung hinted that it might skip making a Note this year in March, when, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335502/galaxy-note-2021-delay-canceled-samsung"&gt;an earnings call, it said&lt;/a&gt; that “it could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in a year.” That’s likely a reference to the ongoing chip shortage, but there are other question marks around the Note line in general. Now that the regular Samsung Galaxy S21 line has stylus support, it seems the main benefit of getting a Note is having a place to store the stylus. It’s an open question whether Samsung actually intends to continue making Galaxy Note devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oGCSV"&gt;Finally, Roh’s post makes some vague references to “collaborations with trusted industry leaders like Google and Microsoft,” with a hint that it could mean better support for multitasking on the Z Fold 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3jsoD"&gt;Hopefully, it also means that Samsung, Google, and Microsoft are working together to normalize how multitasking works on Android. Ever since folding phones started appearing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21417432/foldable-phones-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-flip-5g-microsoft-duo"&gt;specter of fragmentation has haunted them&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung and Microsoft each offer different experiences for how to organize and manage different windows on their screens. Although Google has regularly added support for folding features to Android, it hasn’t taken a strong hand in ensuring phones from different manufacturers work in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="txFEyr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fold, Flip, or Duo: why fold a phone?|95266" data-volume-uuid="df76ea051" data-volume-id="95266" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-131" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGhPOe"&gt;Finally, Roh gestures to Samsung’s collaboration with Google on the new Wear OS 3 smartwatch platform. He confirms that Samsung will continue to integrate its watches with its Galaxy software ecosystem, pointing out that both Samsung health and SmartThings will continue to be on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DDAnd"&gt;Samsung’s fall 2020 Unpacked event will be online only on August 11th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. You can expect full coverage that day — and likely more leaks before then. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla rewrote its own software to survive the chip shortage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NGybaU"&gt;Tesla is weathering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; by rewriting its vehicle software to support alternative chips, CEO Elon Musk said during an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin"&gt;earnings call Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The shortage has upended the auto industry at a time of historic demand for new cars, leading to factory shutdowns, longer wait times, and higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFsSFf"&gt;“We were able to substitute alternative chips, and then write the firmware in a matter of weeks,” Musk said. “It’s not just a matter of swapping out a chip; you also have to rewrite the software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spEdyW"&gt;This approach has helped Tesla maintain high levels of production, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk"&gt;delivering over 200,000 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to customers over the course of the last three months, the company said. Tesla generated $11.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, including $1.1 billion in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMYjlL"&gt;Tesla isn’t alone in feeling the effects of the global shortage. With demand for cars at an all-time high, automakers around the world are feeling the constraints of production with chips in short supply. This week, Daimler and BMW said the lack of chips has forced it to shutdown some of their assembly lines, which will cut the companies’ output by tens of thousands of vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NQHILw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IplDvm"&gt;Musk said that Tesla’s future growth will depend on a swift resolution to the global semiconductor shortage. “The global chip shortage situation remains quite serious,” he said. “For the rest of this year, our growth rate will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain,” which includes the wide range of chips used in Tesla’s vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouor7i"&gt;Tesla relies on chips to power everything from its airbags to the modules that control the vehicles’ seatbelts — which now means Tesla is missing components that are essential for the vehicle’s safety features. “A big struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and seatbelts,” Musk said. “And obviously you cannot ship a car without those.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvTMBo"&gt;Musk sounded an uncertain note about the future. “It does seem like it’s getting better,” he said, “but it’s hard to predict.”&lt;/p&gt;
