    <title>Twitch disables Trump’s account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q_g5mn1Kk8GZ6c6ScN0Z6EY_lFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633916/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3TK7om"&gt;Twitch has disabled President Donald Trump’s account indefinitely following his encouragement of a pro-Trump mob’s attack of the US Capitol on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id6pbc"&gt;“In light of yesterday’s shocking attack on the Capitol, we have disabled President Trump’s Twitch channel,” a Twitch spokesperson said in a statement. “Given the current extraordinary circumstances and the President’s incendiary rhetoric, we believe this is a necessary step to protect our community and prevent Twitch from being used to incite further violence.” The company says it will reassess Trump’s account after he leaves office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EnupVl"&gt;Trump’s account remains live, so archived videos and his profile are still available. But while the account is disabled, he won’t be able to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR3JKx"&gt;In June, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307145/twitch-donald-trump-ban-campaign-account"&gt;temporarily banned Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt; for “hateful conduct” that was aired on his stream. The ban was lifted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21310514/twitch-trump-unbanned-hateful-conduct-suspended"&gt;after two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday evening, Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218088/twitch-bans-pogchamp-poggers-capitol-trump-violence-gootecks"&gt;deleted the well-known PogChamp emote&lt;/a&gt; because the person on whose face it was based made statements “encouraging further violence after what took place in the Capitol today,” according to Twitch. The streaming platform plans to work with the community to design a new emote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiZtoq"&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;placed an indefinite ban&lt;/a&gt; on Trump’s account and said the ban would not be lifted before Inauguration Day. Twitter locked Trump’s account &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt; and said that further violations of its policies will result in a “permanent suspension” of his account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pWxB1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th, 2:34PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Trump’s account is still live, so the account has not been entirely banned. We have updated the headline to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal sees surge in new signups after boost from Elon Musk and WhatsApp controversy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Messenger apps on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERlWDP9B9EUgH9dB9zDdzOHIc_U=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633906/1229931679.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Christoph Dernbach / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ttWatW"&gt;Encrypted messaging app Signal says it’s seeing a swell of new users signing up for the platform, so much so that the company is seeing delays in phone number verifications of new accounts across multiple cell providers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pM3kHW"&gt;As for what or who is responsible for so many new users interested in trying the platform, which is operated by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, there are two likely culprits: Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Signal competitor WhatsApp.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eAVSUh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Verification codes are currently delayed across several providers because so many new people are trying to join Signal right now (we can barely register our excitement). We are working with carriers to resolve this as quickly as possible. Hang in there.&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1347240006444675072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bLpilt"&gt;Musk, who is now the world’s richest person &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;after surpassing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in net worth&lt;/a&gt;, tweeted a meme last night criticizing Facebook for its role in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;helping members of the mob that stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; organize online. The tweet, an image of a series of ever-larger dominos, juxtaposed the start of Facebook as a hot-or-not women-rating website on the campus of Harvard University all the way into a platform that in one way or another helped facilitate the attack on Congress on Wednesday while it attempted to certify Joe Biden as the president-elect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Aa37Q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is called the domino effect &lt;a href="https://t.co/qpbEW54RvM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qpbEW54RvM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347031803987599360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbZ1Ls"&gt;Musk, who has been more vocal in his criticism of Facebook in recent years, followed up the meme with a suggestion to his 41.5 million followers: download Signal, presumably instead of using a Facebook product (although Musk didn’t call out Facebook or WhatsApp specifically by name in either of his posts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Ab0st"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Use Signal&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDolUr"&gt;As for the WhatsApp controversy, that’s a bit more complicated. While it’s not immediately clear whether Musk was referencing or is even aware of the current WhatsApp privacy dustup, there is a growing backlash against the Facebook-owned messaging app resulting from the company’s plans to implement a new privacy policy on February 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9kFoy"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/"&gt;great explainer from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that WhatsApp has outlined a new privacy policy going into effect next month that no longer includes language indicating it will allow users to opt out of data sharing with parent company Facebook. Instead, the new policy expressly outlines how WhatsApp will share data (stuff like your phone number, profile name, and address book info) with Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62cVrl"&gt;“As part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies,” the &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy"&gt;new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; says. “We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OtVAcJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook says its new privacy policy changes nothing about consumer data sharing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZsXFw"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;reports, the opt out hasn’t actually existed in the app for some time — it was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/26/12655518/how-to-stop-whatsapp-sharing-phone-number-facebook"&gt;one-time option introduced back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and WhatsApp’s privacy policy has kept language referencing it since. A Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the changes going into effect next month are designed to address data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp with regard to messaging with businesses, and that nothing is effectively changing with regard to consumer chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7xm7V"&gt;Facebook says it disclosed these changes back in October with the announcement of &lt;a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp"&gt;new WhatsApp customer service and shopping features&lt;/a&gt;, some of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163106/whatsapp-carts-feature-shopping-in-app-ecommerce"&gt;went live last month&lt;/a&gt;. It also says it will honor any WhatsApp user’s opt-out preference, even though the option to opt out hasn’t been available for new users for years, according to &lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt;. And if you live in Europe, WhatsApp won’t share data with Facebook for ad-targeting purposes under any circumstances, as clarified by Niamh Sweeney, WhatsApp’s director of policy for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa market, in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347183889995935744"&gt;Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o9WDi7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2/5 It has been incorrectly reported that WhatsApp's latest Terms of Service and Privacy Policy update requires users in the European Region to agree to the sharing of data with Facebook for ads purposes in order to continue using the service. This is false.&lt;/p&gt;— Niamh Sweeney (@NiamhSweeneyNYC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NiamhSweeneyNYC/status/1347184836323237889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ALsdXk"&gt;But what’s happening now appears to be a bit of context collapse on social media, as WhatsApp users think they’re now being forced to share data with Facebook even though that’s been happening all along if they didn’t opt out back in 2016. None of this is helped by Facebook and WhatsApp’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165152/whatsapp-privacy-apple-first-third-party-app-store-nutrition-labels"&gt;recent attacks on Apple&lt;/a&gt; for the iPhone maker’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;mandate new self-reported labels on iOS apps&lt;/a&gt; and its future plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;force app makers to request permission&lt;/a&gt; to track Apple device owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b54dxr"&gt;The new privacy policy notice doesn’t help Facebook’s cause, either, considering it tells users displeased with the changes — which, again, are about how businesses manage their chats on WhatsApp using Facebook’s backend — to “delete their account,” with no other remedies provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obnfMl"&gt;All of this has created a perfect storm on social media in which WhatsApp users appear to be fleeing the platform in large numbers to join Signal, a nonprofit-run encrypted messaging app not owned by the largest social network on the planet. It’s worth mentioning too Signal Messenger, LLC, the software organization that manages product development from Signal, was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/"&gt;co-founded and funded by Brian Acton&lt;/a&gt;, the disillusioned WhatsApp co-founder who has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17145200/brian-acton-delete-facebook-whatsapp"&gt;publicly slammed his former employer’s privacy practices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPHPbY"&gt;Facebook has declined to comment on the record or publish any public blog post or statement regarding its planned WhatsApp privacy policy outside the Europe-specific comments from Sweeney, which is only adding to the confusion at this point. But the silver lining for Signal is that this combination of events is generating a whole lot of interest for its platform as both a viable mobile messaging app and alternative to the Facebook ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from. With so many Echo devices currently available, there is a device for every occasion. Maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKAXTh"&gt;Currently, the 3rd-gen Echo Dot gets frequent price drops, and right now, you can get it for $25 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot/dp/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1760a049c05833dc1017f6d4057815bf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725321348360875873" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-54148143&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. That deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Dot-4th-Gen/dp/B08LX6M79Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2437a501e22872097e2f2ce286c01eb0&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598862588130784" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the fourth-gen Echo Dot at Amazon, you get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Right now, you can get this device for $40 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LY7VXZM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=3799c464c93a5518a928cb97bc4e8bd6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you purchase it on Amazon, you can also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo also includes a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;If you are looking for just one Amazon Echo, it is down to its lowest price ever of $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085HK4KL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2dfe20818827f68bbc17c1bb24f2a7a8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724598980020491868" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770247%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo from Amazon, you also get six months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HtqAa"&gt;If you are looking for two Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $140&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $60 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90, but right now, you can buy the device at its best-ever price of $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d1731cf9b61b13aa734867a184283f9a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy an Echo Show 5 on Amazon right now, you will receive a one-year subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884074/amazon-discovery-food-network-kitchen-guy-fieri"&gt;Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;Normally, this device costs $130, but it has seen some good price reductions in the past. We have seen the device go down as low as $65. But if you are looking to buy the device now, you can get it for just $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9dd29d118d711aac9ce70db04cc48e45&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="TQX4oe"&gt;In 2019, Amazon released its first pair of true wireless earbuds: the Echo Buds. The Echo Buds offer superb sound quality, a comfy fit, and Bose’s noise reduction features. And, of course, they also include Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product you may want to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chinese search giant Baidu to make electric cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Largest Data Center in Asia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FKPZBZSjKkFNrQw5Y3oQwOlD9jg=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633551/1211912915.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read Costfoto/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjjwFJ"&gt;Chinese search giant Baidu plans to make electric vehicles with help from Geely, the country’s largest private automaker, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baidu-geely-electric-exclusive-idUKKBN29C21N?taid=5ff72c7ec9e53c00013d5ff3&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest Chinese conglomerate to venture into the flourishing electric vehicle market, following shopping giant Alibaba and ride-hailing behemoth Didi Chuxing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r06zTO"&gt;Making electric vehicles would also represent a broadening of Baidu’s ambition to branch into transportation. Baidu has already spent years working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923966/baidu-apollo-self-driving-car-platform-ford-intel-nvidia"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15352462/baidu-project-apollo-self-driving-cars-autonomous"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; and is the leading Chinese company in the autonomous vehicle space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWHB7n"&gt;Baidu will likely form a new joint venture with Geely for the EV effort, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports, and will develop software for the vehicle while Geely focuses on the hardware. Specifically, Baidu and Geely are in talks to use the latter’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-geely-electric/geely-launches-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-platform-idUKKCN26E1ZN"&gt;scalable electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt; that it announced late last year. But Baidu will own a majority stake in the new company and will therefore control its direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRAJwn"&gt;The Chinese government has spent years focusing its biggest companies on developing green technology in an attempt to beat other world powers to the punch. Beijing has insinuated that a gas car ban was on the horizon since 2017 (before &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/10/27/china-plans-2035-gas-car-ban-that-doesnt-actually-ban-gas-cars/"&gt;ultimately putting a policy in place late last year&lt;/a&gt;) and announced generous subsidy policy for clean vehicles, leading to an incredible boom in electric vehicle startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32TtcT"&gt;The country’s biggest tech companies have spent that time eyeing the best way into the market. At first, they simply placed bets. Alibaba funded XPeng, an electric vehicle startup that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18277168/xpeng-china-tesla-apple-trade-secret-theft-electric"&gt;first made headlines by copying Tesla’s designs&lt;/a&gt;. Tencent backed Nio, one of the first (and now biggest) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;EV startups in China&lt;/a&gt;. But recently they’ve made more concrete moves. Alibaba formed an electric vehicle joint venture with SAIC, which is China’s largest carmaker. Didi Chuxing is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570016/didi-chuxing-byd-electric-car-ride-hailing-china"&gt;working with Chinese automotive giant BYD to make electric ride-hailing vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Baidu’s partnership with Geely is the latest example of this concentrated effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQbtT5"&gt;Geely has big ambitions itself. The company already owns Volvo and &lt;a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Daimler-AG-Geely-Holding-Group-and-its-subsidiary-brands-to-join-forces-on-a-highly-efficient-powertrain-system-specified-for-hybrid-applications.xhtml?oid=48210748"&gt;has a partnership with Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler&lt;/a&gt;. But it also has its hand in everything from passenger drones, to a high-speed rail, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21162244/geely-satellite-network-autonomous-connected-cars-starlink"&gt;a newly proposed satellite network&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matt Gaetz’s antifa-detecting facial recognition story is complete nonsense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electoral College Vote" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0DFussJJwkgfxmKUfySvin70TwY=/0x0:4525x3017/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633373/1230458769.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XaBtbp"&gt;Yesterday, a mob of Trump supporters overran the US Capitol, causing widespread chaos in an attempt to nullify the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the wake of the attacks, several Republican politicians have claimed the attackers were anti-fascist activists, in spite of the widespread Trump paraphernalia and triumphant social media posts by Trump supporters. But there’s no evidence antifa played a notable role in the riot, and one of the most widely cited examples has already fallen apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9vPdz"&gt;In a widely heard House speech on Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (one of 147 Republican Congress members who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218285/twitter-facebook-trump-coup"&gt;voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results&lt;/a&gt;) claimed that the mob had been infiltrated by antifa. But Gaetz cited confusing, unverifiable facial recognition evidence from a company that now calls the original article defamatory — and says it identified neo-Nazis, not antifa supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwA433"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jQ0ok4iJ25s?t=7859"&gt;In a speech&lt;/a&gt; during the process of certifying President-elect Joe Biden, Gaetz claimed there was “some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company” that some Capitol rioters were actually “members of the violent terrorist group antifa.” (Antifa is not a single defined group, does not have an official membership, and has not been designated a terrorist organization, although President Donald Trump has described it as one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l45AWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The story cites an unidentified “retired military officer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJFh8u"&gt;Gaetz attributed this claim to a short &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; article published yesterday. That article, in turn, cited a “retired military officer.” The officer asserted that a company called XRVision “used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia antifa members to two men inside the Senate.” The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;said it had been given a copy of the photo match, but it didn’t publish the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5K6dX"&gt;There is no evidence to support the &lt;em&gt;Times’&lt;/em&gt; article, however. An XRVision spokesperson linked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://apelbaum.wordpress.com/2021/01/07/statement-about-the-washington-times-false-claim-that-xrvision-detected-antifa-in-the-capital-building-riots/"&gt;a blog post by CTO Yaacov Apelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, denying its claims and calling the story “outright false, misleading, and defamatory.” (Speech delivered during congressional debate, such as Gaetz’s, is &lt;a href="https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1952042500"&gt;protected from defamation claims&lt;/a&gt;.) The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article was apparently deleted a few hours after Apelbaum’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DxJgxCqU76eWUjMZgC2zasm8LB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219799/the_pois_from_the_capital_building_1_7_2021_thumb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: XRVision&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;XRVision image purportedly analyzing photograph from the riots on Capitol Hill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R5aBmG"&gt;“XRVision didn’t generate any composites or detections for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; or for any ‘retired military officer,’ nor did it authorize them to make any such claims or representations,” Apelbaum wrote. According to his post, XRVision did analyze video footage of the riots, and the company identified “several individuals” in a composite it shared with a “handful” of outsiders. However, they were not linked with antifa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Wfdasd"&gt;We concluded that two of the individuals (Jason Tankersley and Matthew Heimbach) were affiliated with the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movements. These two are known Nazi organizations; they are not Antifa. The third individual identified (Jake Angeli) is an actor with some QAnon promotion history. Again, no Antifa identification was made for him either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HzBrMT"&gt;Angeli, who frequently appears at protests in a horned helmet and face paint, is known as the “Q Shaman” and is affiliated with the conspiracy movement QAnon. Angeli previously participated in a documentary called “The Patriots,” in which he espoused an extreme pro-Trump ideology rather than anything aligned with antifa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i16thv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You've likely seen photos of shirtless, horned/fur hat Jake Angeli, aka QAnon Shaman, storming the U.S. capitol. Some say he's antifa. He's not. He was part of doc "The Patriots" from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruelaswritings?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ruelaswritings&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; me. Embedded a clip from the doc. Link to see entire &lt;a href="https://t.co/52GovxYPnS"&gt;https://t.co/52GovxYPnS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Qj2GNJirAs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Qj2GNJirAs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Wallace (@DavidWallce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWallce/status/1347224024644927490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="21aQT7"&gt;These names tally with earlier evidence posted by critics of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; piece. The Twitter account Respectable Lawyer, for instance, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RespectableLaw/status/1347055072530853890"&gt;posted a long thread&lt;/a&gt; debunking the claims of antifa involvement. That account noted that Tankersley and Heimbach’s photos &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; appear on a Philadelphia antifa site, but only because the site was identifying them as neo-Nazis. However, while that thread identified Tankersley by his tattoos, it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RespectableLaw/status/1347081503025614851"&gt;did not definitively place Heimbach&lt;/a&gt; at the riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDXQri"&gt;Even after Apelbaum’s update, it’s not actually clear if XRVision’s technology works or how statistics like the “match rate” on the composite were calculated. &lt;a href="http://www.xrvision.com/"&gt;XRVision’s website&lt;/a&gt; offers little information about its software.

Apelbaum posted his statement after activists and journalists had already identified Angeli and Tankersley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ahY9TY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even the best facial recognition software can misidentify suspects&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VDR0y"&gt;At best, facial recognition remains a flawed technology that can easily misidentify targets. Amazon’s Rekognition system, which was used by US law enforcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;until 2020&lt;/a&gt;, erroneously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition"&gt;matched 28 members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; with criminal mugshots. Last month, a New Jersey man sued after being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html"&gt;falsely identified and arrested&lt;/a&gt; based on an incorrect facial recognition match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6PmRW"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article was apparently deleted without a correction after Gaetz already widely spread its thinly sourced myth about antifa-identifying facial recognition tech. And it’s part of a much broader false theory that “antifa infiltrators” caused the widespread chaos during yesterday’s riot. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1346954747996205062"&gt;quoted a tweet&lt;/a&gt; speciously claiming a “bus load” of “antifa thugs” had infiltrated the demonstrations, stating that “these are not Trump supporters.” In reality, “antifa buses” are a well-known hoax that led one group of Washington townspeople to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281581/antifa-bus-hoax-trump-misinformation-protests-police"&gt;terrorize a family on a camping trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmOJ2K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur#antifa-capitol-mob"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, there is no evidence that antifa or other left-wing figures had a substantial presence at the riot. &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; author Rowan Scarborough did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of Rep. Gaetz.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s latest gaming monitors include its first with HDMI 2.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro XV28" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqvloJ59jS-fXEeGf-ZgUD1qeDw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633315/nitroxv28.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nitro XV28 is Acer’s first monitor with HDMI 2.1&lt;/em&gt; | Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpmSWx"&gt;As the first part of Acer’s CES 2021 announcements, the company shared that it has three new gaming monitors releasing in May. In terms of specs, the standout product is the new Nitro XV28, a 28-inch 4K monitor with an IPS display and a 144Hz refresh rate with FreeSync Premium. It’s Acer’s first gaming monitor to use HDMI 2.1 ports, giving it the spec (assuming you’re using an HDMI 2.1-compliant cable) to support up to 4K gaming at 120 frames per second with variable refresh rate (VRR). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7Gg3I"&gt;So, not only is this a solid option for PC gamers hoping to squeeze the most out of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an option about which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; owners can be equally excited. In terms of port selection, this one has two HDMI ports (both are 2.1), one DisplayPort, one USB-C port capable of 65W PD charging, four USB Type-A 3.0 ports, and a USB Type-B port to power those USB ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlRu3w"&gt;Acer will sell the XV28 for $899, which certainly isn’t cheap, though not out of the ordinary for a 4K screen with fast refresh rates. If you want one that actually fits on your desk, it could be worth it. Though it’s hard not to think that, for around the same price during a sale, you could get a 55-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504781/vizio-oled-smartcast-4k-hdr-tv-now-available"&gt;Vizio 4K OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; that also supports HDMI 2.1 — though &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/oled-2020"&gt;there are reports&lt;/a&gt; that its advertised VRR doesn’t yet work. Meanwhile, Acer claims the XV28 will have “hassle-free support” for the latest consoles at 4K 120Hz with VRR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator XB27" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skkDn7Hx7n7DYdhbyfnJ8HlWL14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219667/xb27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Predator XB27 with a 1440P display and G-Sync.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xs28DJ"&gt;Acer’s other two monitor announcements aren’t any more affordable, but they do have some high-end features missing from the Nitro XV28. The Predator XB27 costs $1,099 and features a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with HDR400 capability, the lowest rung on the DisplayHDR standard that can reach 400 cd/m2 peak brightness — effectively 400 nits, dim enough that it shouldn’t be your choice if you’re actually buying for HDR. It can run at a native 240Hz refresh rate with overclocking up to 275Hz, and it has a 0.5ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm5qHb"&gt;It comes with an Nvidia G-Sync module built in. In addition to the various benefits that it yields for keeping your Nvidia GPU-powered gameplay looking smooth, in this case it allows for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418080/nvidia-g-sync-reflex-360hz-refresh-rate-gaming-monitors-alienware-msi-asus-acer"&gt;Nvidia’s Reflex tech&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes and optimizes latency across all of your connected accessories. This monitor has two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, a trio of USB Type-A 3.0 ports, a single USB Type-A 2.0 port, and a USB Type-B port for powering the USB ports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator XB32" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNiqoz1T46gafjuofIKvJ592Rdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219668/xb32.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite appearing the same size as the monitor mentioned above, the Predator XB32 is 31.5 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m4ZliX"&gt;Finally, the Predator XB32 is a 31.5-inch 4K IPS display that’s G-Sync compatible (an update from GeForce Experience will make it play better with modern Nvidia GPUs). It has a native 144Hz refresh rate and also HDR400, if you want that slightly more vibrant image in apps that support it. This model will sell for $1,199. It features two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, a single USB-C port with 65W PD charging, and four USB Type-A 3.0 ports with a USB Type-B port for powering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdnmK0"&gt;These each seem like solid, albeit pricey picks if you’re really into gaming and want features that can boost the visual fidelity in different ways. The Nitro XB23 and Predator XB27 are the most appealing from a technical level, each with a few great features that set them apart from what’s currently out there. We don’t have the full spec sheets yet, though, and given that they will each release in May, there may be some competitive models on the market by then.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer unveils its AMD-powered Chromebook Spin 514</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three business workers have a meeting, one of which is using the Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 514." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LfKosut1_FhfNMlYajNarsXsRM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633328/Chromebook_Enterprise_Spin_514_High_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t64IOQ"&gt;CES is just days away, but plenty of laptop companies are already unveiling their 2021 lineups. One of Acer’s first new releases is the Chromebook Spin 514, powered by AMD’s Ryzen 3000 mobile processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDQZKK"&gt;You can spec the Spin 514 up to 16GB of DDR4 DRAM and 256GB of storage. Acer claims you’ll get up to 10 hours of battery life. The 14-inch FHD touch display has a 78 percent screen-to-body ratio, and all models have two USB-C ports, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, and a microSD card reader. Some configurations include an HDMI port as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lYp5p"&gt;It’s not the lightest Chromebook around, at 3.42 pounds (1.55 kg) and 0.68 inches (17.35 mm) thick. But Acer says it delivers “military-grade durability” and can withstand up to 132 pounds of downward force. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 at a slight angle from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDB3TXYKWcMcYPdSt1nrjE4ZMrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219850/Acer_Chromebook_Spin_514_CP514_1H_left_facing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yp1fbu"&gt;There’s also a business version, the Chromebook Enterprise Spin 514, which runs the enterprise version of Chrome OS. These models can come with up to 16GB of DDR4 DRAM and 256GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svFnLp"&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 will be available in North America in February, starting at $479.99. The Enterprise Spin 514 is coming in March, and starts at $749.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kuJuI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s 2021 TV lineup runs Google TV and fully embraces HDMI 2.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvJClMMi-UYl_dx4PJUBssN1bLU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633318/X95J_65_CCW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I2rDnP"&gt;Last year’s TV lineup from Sony &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/3/21348598/ps5-sony-tv-playstation-5-ready-4k-8k"&gt;took a bit of criticism&lt;/a&gt; since several sets were unable to take advantage of next-gen gaming features on the PlayStation 5 that shipped in November. &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00246472"&gt;Even if you look right now&lt;/a&gt;, the spread of HDMI 2.1 features is pretty sad. Sony never really acknowledged this as a mistake, believing that customers purchase its TVs for different reasons and not everyone needs every box checked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6fhiO"&gt;What a difference a year makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQeVZ"&gt;In 2021, Sony is correcting course: all of its premium “Bravia XR” 4K (and yes, 8K) TVs support 4K at 120Hz, VRR (variable refresh rate), ALLM (auto low latency mode), and eARC. No asterisks or gotchas or promises to add stuff later with firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rt0y69"&gt;Beyond getting on board with 4K120, Sony is making a big deal over what it calls “cognitive intelligence” in these TVs. Powered by a new Cognitive Processor XR chip, Sony says its new system goes beyond traditional signal processing — which Sony’s TVs already excelled at — and beyond the artificial intelligence analysis in most TVs. “While conventional artificial intelligence (AI) can only detect and analyze picture elements like color, contrast and detail individually, the new processor can cross-analyze an array of elements at once, just as our brains do,” Sony’s press release on the TVs says. “By doing so, each element is adjusted to its best final outcome, in conjunction with each other, so everything is synchronized and lifelike — something that conventional AI cannot achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMmQd7dOi3F1zKymXquSzGqhtEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219990/insitu_65X90J_TVOutsideHighStand_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QkBaqm"&gt;Sony is also talking up what the XR processor can do for sound. A “Sound-from-Picture Reality” feature is claimed to “align the position of the sound with the images on the screen to offer a uniquely lifelike experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Samsung has promised similar results&lt;/a&gt; for its own 2021 Neo QLED TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuN9tl"&gt;The two Master Series TVs (8K LCD and 4K OLED) have a new sensor for detecting the color temperature of the ambient light in your room, and this lets them automatically adjust the TV’s white balance to match. (This setting can be turned off for you purists, of course.) More important is that the A90J Master Series OLED also has brighter output than Sony’s past OLEDs thanks to a new aluminum heat shield attached to the panel. Making OLEDs brighter is a big deal since that’s a key area where LCD sets still tend to win out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aer8nP"&gt;As one of the earliest TV makers that got on board with Android TV, it seems appropriate that Sony will be among the first to transition to Google TV. All of these TVs will offer a software experience that’s incredibly similar to the latest Chromecast: Sony still has its own customizations in the settings menu (and for quick shortcuts like your HDMI inputs), but everything else — the personalized For You page, content recommendations, etc. — is basically unchanged from Google’s latest streaming device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhWFJu"&gt;Sony has also focused on small touches, like adjustable legs that can be configured to allow enough space for a soundbar in front of the TV without obstructing the picture. Going down the lineup, you lose certain niceties (like an antireflective coating exclusive to the 8K set), but all of the TVs support Dolby Vision HDR. And again, you’ve got all the HDMI 2.1 standards accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYOAKX"&gt;Rather than move to new display technology like Mini LED, Sony seems to be evolving its current strategy of full-array local dimming and iterating upon its excellent OLED sets. The company doesn’t share how many dimming zones its TVs have or really talk about peak brightness, believing that competitors get too hung up on those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQPnNI"&gt;Pricing and specific availability info will be announced this spring. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Keep up with all the developments here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8zuTUk"&gt;Online platforms have taken action against President Donald Trump in response to his encouragement of a pro-Trump mob that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th. That day, Facebook and Twitter removed some of Trump’s social media posts, a video, and instituted short-term bans on Trump’s accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngqRae"&gt;But on January 7th, platforms began taking more drastic action, with Facebook deciding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;ban Trump&lt;/a&gt; “indefinitely,” and Shopify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;taking down Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt; (which sold Make America Great Again hats). More actions may follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z56WHr"&gt;We’ll be following the situation closely, and you can keep up with all of the developments right here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfS9fz"&gt;YouTube will temporarily restrict channels that post videos containing widespread misinformation about 2020 election results — including the channel of President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66dVUc"&gt;Instead of simply removing videos that spread misinformation, any channel that post videos with false claims about the election will now receive a strike, temporarily preventing them from uploading videos. This includes Trump’s channel. A YouTube spokesperson did not say how long the suspension would last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXcjyh"&gt;In December, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan"&gt;issued a new policy&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting any content designed to spread misinformation about the outcome of the 2020 election by promoting false theories about fraudulent votes or other unverified claims. Since then, the company has removed thousands of videos, according to a company spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpGZkN"&gt;Prior to yesterday’s events, a grace period was in place allowing YouTube to remove videos without applying strikes to channels. This often happens when YouTube institutes new policies, and it’s designed as an effort to be fair to creators while they adjust to the new rules. The grace period was set to expire on January 21st, following Inauguration Day, according to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ln7kLF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prior to yesterday, YouTube was removing videos without applying strikes to channels as a temporary measure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MknGIJ"&gt;YouTube’s teams made the decision following “the extraordinary events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have been certified&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;according to a YouTube spokesperson. The company removed one of Trump’s videos that addressed a mob attack on the Capitol and also contained widespread misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;about the election results&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, any channel that receives three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated in accordance with YouTube policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3XW1v"&gt;This means that channels spreading misinformation about the election results will see strikes applied to their channels if they continue. For example, channels like OANN, a right-wing news organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;that has perpetuated statements&lt;/a&gt; made by the president that he won the election, could receive a strike on top of having videos deleted if it were to continue uploading similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5bogF"&gt;Over the last 24 hours, several companies have taken stricter stances against the president’s content. Twitter suspended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Trump’s account for 12 hours&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to ban the president outright if he posted another tweet violating the company’s policies or inciting violence. Facebook initially prevented Trump from posting to Facebook and Instagram for 24 hours, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced even stricter measures&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning that include indefinitely suspending his account for at least the next couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
