    <title>Vaccine rollout won’t be equitable unless health care reckons with racism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ki8dEm"&gt;The pandemic has been anything but “the great equalizer” that some people called it when it started more than a year ago. Here in the US, COVID-19 has sickened and killed a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html"&gt;disproportionate&lt;/a&gt; number of Black, Native American, and Latinx people. Vaccine rollout is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/health/white-people-covid-vaccines-minorities.html"&gt;proving to be inequitable&lt;/a&gt;, too. Black and Latinx elders in Los Angeles, for example, have been &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-08/l-a-latinos-black-seniors-fall-behind-in-covid-19-vaccine-access-compared-to-whites"&gt;vaccinated at a lower rate&lt;/a&gt; than their white and Asian American counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBz4bn"&gt;Distrust in vaccines has been a challenge across the board. But Black Americans were less inclined than other racial and ethnic groups to want to get vaccinated, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey from December. To fix a system that isn’t fully serving Black Americans and other people of color, “There really needs to be some healing,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/melva-thompson-robinson"&gt;Melva Thompson-Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Center for Health Disparities Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGPGdj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Thompson-Robinson about the roots of that distrust and how to heal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqMr9l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoC5e6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does distrust for vaccines in communities of color differ from white celebrities or conspiracy theorists who are anti-vaxxers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKtm9e"&gt;It’s not just a simple matter of, “Oh, I don’t believe that something works because this is what I heard.” This is about that deep-rooted, historical trauma that has been carried down through generations. That distrust comes out of the racism that they experience. When you’re talking about African Americans, in particular, you’re talking about a group of people who are descendants of slaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="F7EuPE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPw1uH"&gt;And so it’s a different kind of thing. It’s not “I believe that these vaccines aren’t effective because I heard that’s what somebody said.” This is “I’m not trusting because of the experience that my family has had under slavery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeZ3Bb"&gt;A big thing now is people are looking at who’s in charge. Who’s running the vaccine trials? Who’s participating in the trials? They say, “Well, I don’t see people who look like me.” Or “I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see people who look like me.” And all of that is huge. We need to see people who look like us who are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcOU8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of those historical traumas that have led to distrust of vaccines among some people of color?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORkLlS"&gt;When you start to talk particularly about slaves, one of the men who is credited as being the founder of gynecology actually did &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513764158/remembering-anarcha-lucy-and-betsey-the-mothers-of-modern-gynecology"&gt;surgery on Black women&lt;/a&gt; because they were considered property. He was doing gynecological surgery with no anesthesia because part of the thought was “Well, they don’t experience pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyA1iy"&gt;That’s not true. All people experience pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEK7oI"&gt;You can jump the &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/history/40-years-human-experimentation-america-tuskegee-study"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;. You could also even look at the story of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nih-family-of-henrietta-lacks-reach-deal-on-access-to-dna-code/2013/08/07/68f3da04-ff8b-11e2-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html"&gt;Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt;, who had cervical cancer. And they harvested her cells at Johns Hopkins and still to this day still use her cells for research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dvVTH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s not true. All people experience pain.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoYyp3"&gt;So people are saying, “Well, you need to trust the health care system.” But health care systems, health care facilities, and health care providers need to act in a trustful manner. You can’t just expect people to say, “Oh yeah, I’ll now trust you” after centuries of mistrust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPBCB4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we see inequities playing out today when it comes to vaccine rollout in the US? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RizTg"&gt;The challenge has been with some of the vaccines that you have to have very specialized storage capabilities, which then has limited where some of these can be distributed. Communities of color don’t always have access to those storage facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux9e95"&gt;For people working in grocery stores or other retail and food outlets, it’s not as simple for them to take time off to go to an appointment. If they don’t have sick leave or they have a limited amount of leave, they can’t go and stand in line for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2zqOeQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t just expect people to say, ‘Oh yeah, I’ll now trust you’ after centuries of mistrust.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYckqS"&gt;Another challenge is the messaging that’s going out to people. You already know that you have populations that are concerned about getting the vaccine. So the messaging for that population needs to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMpzF9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no “one size fits all” prescription for how to reach out to different communities of color. But what should solutions or outreach strategies look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSxusx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-establishes-new-equity-initiative-as-working-class-communities-hit-hard-by-covid-19-slow-to-receive-vaccine"&gt;Here in Clark County&lt;/a&gt; where Las Vegas is located, the governor just came out last week with an equity initiative. Because if you look at the data, where the cases are versus where people are who are getting the vaccine — it’s two different places within the same city. It’s not the same group of people. We’re seeing this inequitable distribution of resources. We’re in this perfect storm, and in order to survive it, I think there has to be some relinquishing of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQYB9b"&gt;There really needs to be some healing and some stepping back. Not rushing, but stepping back and saying: “You know what, we hear what you’re saying. We understand where we’ve done wrong, and we want to do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xKddLD"&gt;
&lt;p id="6DSJrG"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week. &lt;/p&gt;

This is not the case. A study found that those other coronaviruses didn’t produce antibodies that were effective against the new coronavirus.

    <title>Minneapolis prohibits use of facial recognition software by its police department</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sC42K8mphTgM4URpVh5EdfjtNJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814291/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njnJsy"&gt;The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously on Friday to approve an ordinance banning the use of facial recognition software by its police department and other city agencies, the &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-passes-restrictive-ban-on-facial-recognition-use-by-police-others/600022551/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The ban adds Minneapolis to the list of US cities moving to limit or end the use of such technology by its law enforcement officers and city employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qw7dC6"&gt;But Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said in a statement that the ban was created without feedback from him, and that he believes it’s possible for facial recognition technology to be “utilized in accordance with data privacy and other citizen legal protections,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. Facial recognition software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;has been found&lt;/a&gt; to have age, race, and ethnic biases, and privacy advocates have raised concerns about its use by law enforcement. Minneapolis’ ordinance created an appeals process allowing city agencies to request exemptions under some circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5XVQH"&gt;Minneapolis was the site of huge public protests last summer after one of its &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officers-involved-deadly-arrest-black-man-minneapolis-have-been-fired-n1215046"&gt;police officers killed George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; during an arrest in May. The city council &lt;a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/06/26/minneapolis-city-council-takes-another-step-toward-dismantling-police-department/"&gt;voted to disband its police department&lt;/a&gt; last June, but ended up &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/us/minneapolis-police-funding.html"&gt;reducing the department’s 2021 budget&lt;/a&gt; by less than 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WQF8a"&gt;Software made by Clearview AI —the controversial firm that has a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;database of some 3 billion images&lt;/a&gt; scraped from social media and other websites— would be included under Minneapolis’ facial recognition ban. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year that Minneapolis was one of the police departments that had access to Clearview’s software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;Clearview also has contracts&lt;/a&gt; with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0w4qUu"&gt;Other cities have also implemented bans on facial recognition software, with Portland blocking both public and private use of the technology. &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/23/boston-facial-recognition-ban"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-bans-use-of-facial-recognition-14101253.php"&gt;and Oakland&lt;/a&gt; have also passed laws prohibiting public institutions from using facial recognition, but Portland was the first to prohibit private use. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few of the best deals for the holiday weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgHOMvPC4l4HqCezWv46RgbNwc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814046/akrales_190716_3546_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s The Verge’s Chris Welch wearing Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uz30AX"&gt;You wouldn’t know it from looking at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s deals coverage this week, but we’ve been getting &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many pitches for deals that are on because of Valentine’s Day on Sunday, February 14th, and Presidents’ Day, which is happening the following day in the US. We haven’t featured any of them because, truthfully, better deals have popped up. But below, you’ll find a mix of the holiday-themed deals you actually need to know about, along with some favorite discounts of the week that are still happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8ng4jF"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6oiPeLI9h3CU5VY0iEucQh5AOKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18314842/akrales_190716_3546_0185.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J2V0HV"&gt;Bose’s refurbished headphones are $150 off until today at 10:55AM ET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsO9y5"&gt;At eBay, you can save 20 percent on refurbished tech by using the code &lt;strong&gt;PREZDAY20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. I invite you to try it out on anything that strikes your fancy, but I think one of the best ways to utilize the one-time-use coupon is on Bose’s refurbished Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, its latest (and greatest) set of over-ear noise-canceling cans. These usually cost $379 new, but they’re $224 before tax with the offer code applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXgHL"&gt;Seeing “refurbished” might spook some people, and I get it. But you shouldn’t worry as much with these. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%2F153863412679&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F13%2F22278064%2Fpresidents-day-headphones-tech-sale-bose-beats-flex-earbuds-oneplus-8#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On the page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that each set of headphones is in “pristine, like-new condition” and that it’ll be “in new packaging with original and new accessories.” Also, if you live in the US, eBay automatically tacks on a two-year warranty through Allstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nv5yaU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xsg9Vm"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Apple’s new Beats Flex earbuds, pictured in yellow." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xTmRbKZGtzUUNb7kIN3CIlmRsnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21971885/BF904AC7_A371_4D8E_B0A9_0CA38299CBD9.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KOuw1O"&gt;Beats Flex neckbuds with USB-C charging start at just $40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p7JCmx"&gt;If those Bose headphones are a little too pricey, the Beats Flex wireless neckbuds are $40 at Amazon in either the black or neon green colorway. They’re normally $50, so it’s not a huge price cut, though it amounts to a 20-percent discount. These are the first Beats that are just as easy to recommend for people using Android phones as they are for iPhone users. That’s because they charge via USB-C, and they also have a companion app on Android. On iPhone, they can easily and quickly pair with their Apple W1 wireless chip, letting them also switch between compatible Apple devices that have previously been paired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="F9WegQ"&gt;Get the OnePlus 8, then save 50 percent on a second phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D0MT1l"&gt;OnePlus is hosting a Presidents’ Day deal that lets you save when you buy two OnePlus 8 phones, which is helpful if you’re buying for a family. The glacial green-colored phone costs $599, and if you add a second one to your cart, you’ll automatically get 50 percent off it, totaling $898 for both. This deal will go on until Wednesday, February 17th, or until supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You shouldn’t have to publicly humiliate AT&amp;T to get usable internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeEMhyv_WMG2_-j9LCMo_8vvg9k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68813093/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEybzN"&gt;Earlier this month, Aaron Epstein spent $10,000 to buy an ad in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; to tell AT&amp;amp;T’s CEO he wasn’t happy with his internet service — service that was limited to a paltry 3Mbps (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/?comments=1"&gt;v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/"&gt;ia &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Now, AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/90-year-old-gets-att-300mbps-fiber-a-week-after-complaining-in-wsj-print-ad"&gt;has him hooked up with a fiber connection&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s getting over 300 Mbps up and down. All it took was getting interviewed by &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721"&gt;the ad going viral on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6eDIFJvW0gQ?list=PLiZxWe0ejyv92RSYPiA1AcKYiOZtRVABO&amp;amp;t=141"&gt;a Stephen Colbert mention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YxIuY"&gt;In his ad, the North Hollywood, CA resident says he’s been an AT&amp;amp;T customer for 60 years (and backs it up with a @pacbell.net email address), and says he’s disappointed that the company isn’t keeping up with competitors when it comes to his area’s internet. Less than two weeks later, AT&amp;amp;T techs had him hooked up, though the company says it was part of a planned rollout. That’s a statement that may belong in the “dubious” category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wjx43c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I mean how upset one must be, over slow home internet speeds, to pay for a personal quarter-page national ad in print &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WSJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zk9umKD0t1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zk9umKD0t1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Raju Narisetti (@raju) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGdDlo"&gt;It’s certainly good for Epstein that his ad worked, especially given how much it cost. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21117306/iowa-caucus-rural-broadband-access-election-campaign-sanders-warren"&gt;it’s  been estimated that there are millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who don’t have access to any access to home internet at all, let alone broadband (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which itself is arguably not fast enough&lt;/a&gt;), and they can’t all afford ads in the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. Besides, that certainly seems like a trick that would only work once, especially given that it may only work for one household at a time — &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/90-year-old-gets-att-300mbps-fiber-a-week-after-complaining-in-wsj-print-ad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t able to get a straight answer&lt;/a&gt; about whether Epstein’s neighbors would be getting faster service anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfjw9o"&gt;Yes, this is a success story: Epstein was able to get AT&amp;amp;T, a goliath telecom company, to install fiber to his house. He even got a call from AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey himself. But even those of us who do have decent internet are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;struggling with data caps&lt;/a&gt;, ISPs that don’t really compete, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;don’t even seem to have a clear picture of what their own networks are capable of&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXaLYn"&gt;If anything, this story highlights how little power the public has when it comes to their internet access — if you need to have $10,000 to publicly humiliate your ISP, we’re doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: eBay might not let you sell items without a bank account starting Valentine’s Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eBay new logo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5rPr94Ej4MgjhutHv1R1aVz-ws=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68813065/ebay-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNgOlx"&gt;In 2002, eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion, turning it into &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;way you’d buy and get paid for items you sell on the ginormous auction site. But the once-happy couple has been breaking up for years — and on Valentine’s Day, some sellers may no longer be able to sell items on eBay &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; without connecting an old-school bank account instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAAj0E"&gt;This morning, I received a final warning that I would need to add a bank account by February 14th or else “your ability to revise or relist existing listings, or create new listings will be disabled.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LmHATrQVjQjsvexgK27_hhFOQQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301302/ebay_warning.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MwsVpP"&gt;eBay tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this isn’t the deadline for every seller — it’s rolling out in phases, and a quick scan of the web shows it’s been going on for at least a couple years. This isn’t the final phase either, as eBay tells us the rollout won’t be complete until 2022. But I suspect it’s moving fast: I got this message despite rarely ever selling items on eBay, and company tells me the “majority of sellers” will have eBay-managed payments by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHaWCF"&gt;Digging up a bank account and plugging it into your profile may not be the only annoyance here, by the way. You could be waiting a lot longer for your money, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Fmanaged-payments-on-ebay.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22281056%2Febay-bank-account-required-not-paypal-february-14th#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as eBay’s managed payments site&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_bpRgbRiihf5EQP-CkfZ653buk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301328/managed_payments.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIB6ZI"&gt;Three to six business days is a long time to theoretically wait for money that could have instantly popped into your PayPal. (That said, my last eBay sale didn’t immediately release my funds to PayPal, either. Shrug emoji.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwvVpg"&gt;On the plus side, eBay says most sellers should actually pay lower fees than before, and provides a variety of case studies &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Fsimpler-fees.html%23m22_tb_a1__1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22281056%2Febay-bank-account-required-not-paypal-february-14th#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at this page&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s not like eBay’s really passing along the savings. Previously, eBay would typically take a 10 percent cut and PayPal would take a 2.9 percent cut for a total of 12.9 percent of your take; now, eBay will take a 12.35 percent cut in the same situations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROg8wya_rxaTISrKK9vnGWk9bnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301344/ebay_fees_change.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="48VYny"&gt;While eBay’s graphic (above) might look like you’re saving a big chunk of money when you axe the middleman, you can see (if you look carefully) that the sizes of these bars are misleading. The new middleman is eBay. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Edge extensions store hosted illicit copies of Sonic and Mario Kart 64</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JhNmDBq_Dq26uty49fszJODkG_0=/0x4:527x355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812989/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_4.54.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the Mario Kart 64 listing on the Edge extensions store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vc7tZ"&gt;Microsoft’s Edge extensions store was hosting likely illegal copies of a number of iconic games, including &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mario-kart-64-n64-simul/abfdnoiheolhpbdcehdnhecgclaaekie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/super-mario-bros-game/nmkdnipcejjcbliglpibnffkgpjjpjld"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sonic-the-hedgehog-game/dibhlaandmahmcgndlebpobpcchcjilp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/original-pacman-game/mahclhjcbhohmmkcobhoglipcajcnfcp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tetris-game/iefpnmfngbceeldlcfmkancbginibhno"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cut-the-rope/bcnmodafbghancmdkbbbijkkdoejjfno"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut The Rope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and even Microsoft’s own smash hit &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/minecraft-game-online/cdeankbhhhghfpmlhbebphangglimeog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The developers listed on the titles aren’t Microsoft, Nintendo, or any other recognizable game developer, meaning that they almost certainly aren’t official copies of the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdYSYR"&gt;In the hours since we published this story, every one we initially linked has been pulled down, but others still exist for now, like &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sonic/nflchbbjkneglfanbofhlbdekbhndoko"&gt;this Sonic game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/super-mario-bros-game/akoiiggjcphhkjaogelehljleeofpnjp"&gt;this Mario game&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of Pac-Man games, and a variety of copies of &lt;em&gt;2048, Flappy Bird, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run &lt;/em&gt;and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v13RhF"&gt;Initially, we saw 35 listings across 10 different “developers” with names like “GamePro Inc,” “Gamelands,” “StayReal” and “Kday,” including a number of duplicate games. Many listings, even from different developers, had very similar descriptions, indicating that they could be coming from the same source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYBf7G"&gt;Here are screenshots of just a few of the games we found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qn5xfB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10340835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AcuZn8"&gt;Oddly, Microsoft&lt;em&gt; itself&lt;/em&gt; appeared to promote the browser extensions in what looks to be a now-deleted tweet from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/msedgedev"&gt;@MSEdgeDev account&lt;/a&gt;, which we saw &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-promotes-that-you-can-pirate-games-through-their-browser-for-some-reason.377748/"&gt;via ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-LZ4a2KfrNhJS1fp6k1VwAm8uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301271/nm5i6DK.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-promotes-that-you-can-pirate-games-through-their-browser-for-some-reason.377748/#post-58490358" target="_blank"&gt;KoolAid on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="07oFte"&gt;We didn’t see this purported tweet ourselves, and it isn’t currently on the @MSEdgeDev account right now. But one brave soul on Twitter, Jordan Chase, said he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208"&gt;installed the &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64&lt;/em&gt; extension&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter — and he said that in a reply to a now-deleted tweet from @MSEdgeDev. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJxmK8"&gt;In his tweet, Chase said the Mario Kart 64 extension downloads a ROM of the game. While emulators are generally legal, and some sites (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17138752/internet-archive-handheld-history-collection-game-emulator-mame"&gt;like Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;) host abandonware you can play in a browser, it’s extremely unlikely that Nintendo, which is well-known for cracking down on sites hosting ROMs and pirated content, would let people download copies of its most-loved games over free browser extensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZEr8T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Mario Kart 64 extension downloads a ROM of the N64 game.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/BY9VDMqp3B"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BY9VDMqp3B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jordan Chase (@olynative) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7KxQOx"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; extension also appears to be a clone of the famous puzzle game, though it didn’t download a ROM, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208"&gt;according to Chase&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360345226733182976"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; he installed the &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; extension, and it “seems like it’s using direct assets from the original game.” I didn’t install the games myself in case they were doing something nefarious, and I’d recommend against putting them on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0OpWS"&gt;Some of the games we found have reviews dating back to October, indicating they have been sitting unnoticed in Microsoft’s catalog for quite some time. It’s unclear why they have been available for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6sKOW"&gt;Many listings attempt to skirt trouble with dubious disclaimers acknowledging the listings aren’t affiliated with the original games. Here’s one for the listing for &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64, &lt;/em&gt;for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hi6Qwz"&gt;IMPORTANT: This emulator is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Nintendo. All graphics, games, and other multimedia are copyrighted to their respective owners and authors. This game is for ALL Mario fans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tuyAcP"&gt;Microsoft and Nintendo tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they are looking into the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSN5C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 13th, 1:39AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that some of the games have now been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gjr7pR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 13th, 2:52AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that most of the biggest names have been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gngwcs"&gt;Amazon’s Ring has so many different video doorbells in the market it’s getting hard to keep track, but one of them is apparently about to get a big bump with some brand-new features: The Ring Wi-Fi Video Doorbell Pro 2 has just leaked &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_ynSlpvK_2EJ:https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ring-wi-fi-video-doorbell-pro-2-satin-nickel/15299144+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;in a listing at Best Buy Canada&lt;/a&gt;, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-02/ring-pro-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZatzNotFunny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUvoQa"&gt;It appears to be a direct successor to the high-end Ring Video Doorbell Pro at the same CA$325 (roughly $250 US dollars), but also the first Ring to stream video resolution at higher than 1080p, with a 1536p “expanded Head to Toe view” that “allows you to clearly see who is at your door.” That means Amazon’s catching up to the field-of-view and resolution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/17/20918750/arlo-video-doorbell-price-date"&gt;that Arlo’s Video Doorbell introduced in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wF1YwI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10340730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEQuWU"&gt;As a Ring Video Doorbell Pro owner myself, that would have been a desirable feature: I had to angle my doorbell down with two different add-on brackets so I could actually see packages being delivered to my front porch. But I’m more intrigued by the mention of “3D motion detection,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227528/arlo-touchless-video-doorbell"&gt;sounds like something a touchless doorbell&lt;/a&gt; could use to tell when someone’s standing right in front of it — and maybe cut down on false positives buzzing my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhk7z"&gt;Here’s the rest of Best Buy’s product description:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtTHCs7PjLveAeIgw6MQUXg4hqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301142/ring_video_doorbell_pro_2_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jodl99"&gt;You’ll also notice it comes with Alexa greetings — something Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22279020/alexa-ring-doorbell-greeting-quick-replies"&gt;brought to the original Video Doorbell Pro just the other day&lt;/a&gt;. Note that unlike most other Ring doorbells, the Pro models typically don’t have swappable batteries as an option; you have to wire them up to a powerful doorbell transformer, which you may or may not already have in your home. In January, Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252181/ring-video-doorbell-new-wired-size-features-price"&gt;also added a $60 wired model&lt;/a&gt;, its least expensive yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz39U3"&gt;The Best Buy page suggests it might be available March 31st, though you should always take release dates on early product pages with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWvNgD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If Whoopi Goldberg tells you to wear a mask on the subway, you wear it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-COMMUTERS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnk3v9yKEf_E2LcGeNus7SRMcjM=/54x0:3969x2610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812486/1229473130.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Slim / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cpk9YC"&gt;You might not have to ride public transit to work right now, but if you’re one of the many workers who still commutes in New York City (or if you’re someone like me who fantasizes about their old commute), you’ll now have some new celebrity voice talent to keep you company on your bus or subway ride, &lt;a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-teams-newyorknico-bring-iconic-new-york-voices-subway-and-bus"&gt;the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W59Z7w"&gt;Normal transit announcements can easily fade in the back of riders’ minds. They’re either too garbled to be understood or you’ve heard them so many times that they don’t even register. But that might be different if, say, Whoopi Goldberg was the one reminding you to wear a mask on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aXHyhJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqH3ck4gDlw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v9kQUl"&gt;At least that’s a theoretical benefit of the MTA’s new announcements rolling out today, created in partnership with director and Instagram star Nicolas Heller (&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/newyorknico/?hl=en"&gt;@newyorknico&lt;/a&gt;). There are 25 “iconic New Yorkers” set to speak over the intercom on New York City transit, so if Whoopi isn’t your speed, Jerry Seinfeld is reading some announcements, too, as are Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson from &lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt;, Edie Falco from &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos, &lt;/em&gt;rappers Cam’ron and Jadakiss, and someone who’s been having a bit of a moment lately, Fran Lebowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEyhKW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, you will be hearing over 25 new voices representing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MTA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mta&lt;/a&gt; on subway platforms and buses all over NYC. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UfxuBkkpXL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UfxuBkkpXL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicolas Heller (@NuevaYorkNico) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NuevaYorkNico/status/1360272219641946118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qz78dg"&gt;Getting celebrities to read reminders to wear masks and social distance may not be the best use of the MTA’s resources or time, but according to what &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/09/jerry-seinfeld-and-more-celebs-to-voice-nyc-subway-psas/"&gt;Heller told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“there was no budget for this.” So whether it’s a charming commute distraction or yet another reason to put in your headphones, at least Awkwafina reminding you to wear a mask didn’t cost taxpayers anything. In fact, the project produced some real gems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="A4GV9L"&gt;Ey yo check it out it’s Harlem’s own Killa Cam. Look—I don’t care if you from uptown, downtown, Harlem, Switzerland, wherever. I don’t care if you a chicken or a duck. And you know what? Covid don’t care either. Are you wearin’ a mask? Ya, well is it covering your mouth and nose? Then good, you’re doing great. Remember not only wearin’ a mask is the law—it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="agig1c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZACeaC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irCrNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rJ9EV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bAi3R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fucpnj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Komodo dragon has been crowned Twitch’s permanent PogChamp replacement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOu9AYUbcN1UpWOIPn3V_gm6lkE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812478/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_1.50.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WHQUNR"&gt;On January 6th, the day a riot of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218088/twitch-bans-pogchamp-poggers-capitol-trump-violence-gootecks"&gt;Twitch removed&lt;/a&gt; the iconic PogChamp emote because the person it depicted made statements calling for further violence. Two days later, the company committed to rotating in a new version of PogChamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220874/twitch-pogchamp-face-change-ryan-gootecks-gutierrez"&gt;every 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, meaning many streamers briefly became the new face of the emote — but they were sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;subjected to harassment&lt;/a&gt; following their new site-wide prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh0i50"&gt;On Friday, the Twitch community voted to crown a new face for PogChamp — and the winner isn’t the face of a streamer. It’s a Komodo dragon. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1360340937302552582"&gt;Here’s what the emote looks like&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TceMd6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The community has spoken! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's fire up the PogChamp Machine and activate the new face of Pog. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idQ2cNtMiH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idQ2cNtMiH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1360340937302552582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sy23at"&gt;If you’ve hung out in Twitch chats, you may actually recognize this emote: it’s the beloved &lt;a href="https://twitchemotes.com/emotes/81273"&gt;KomodoHype&lt;/a&gt;. And I can see why it won the community vote. While the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pogchamp"&gt;original PogChamp&lt;/a&gt; was Twitch’s hype emote, I think this Komodo dragon’s face is &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; at expressing hype, especially with its shockingly huge maw that somehow seems to be smiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkz43D"&gt;KomodoHype was selected over another excellent PogChamp done by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/uminokaiju"&gt;streamer UmiNoKaiju&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to watch the full stream about the vote, you can &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/911396128?t=00h15m54s"&gt;check it out on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jCK7xl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v911396128&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2021 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2021. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L8pJhA"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by MonicaChin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ewzfR6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10340665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 15 is one of the best laptops for video editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telaZa"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE proves that you don’t need to break the bank for a great gaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xLW8VK"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
