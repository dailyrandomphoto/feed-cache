    <title>Apple shares memorial to Steve Jobs on 10th anniversary of his death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ure96Cy3FMUwLBlRAbXTxZs4Eo=/0x32:3650x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955046/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_9.13.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUpJQu"&gt;Apple is commemorating its co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ death with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;a new short film and a personal statement&lt;/a&gt; from the visionary tech executive’s family. Jobs passed away 10 years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/6/2473035/apple-steve-jobs-has-died"&gt;on October 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;, after a difficult battle with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9cigZ"&gt;The short film — which has currently taken over Apple’s landing page —  commemorates Jobs’ life in photos, videos, and some of his most iconic quotes, from “the computer is a bicycle for the mind” to the introductions of the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCdSaA"&gt;Apple also published a statement from Jobs’ family, shared below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="leaHWN"&gt;For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together. Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8fKy5"&gt;Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation, but we have come together in a beautiful place of love for Steve, and for what he taught us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTR5Gx"&gt;For all of Steve’s gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured. He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqm0xa"&gt;There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living, and it has served us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzh3pQ"&gt;One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yoI2b"&gt;Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJz1L"&gt;Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/the-steve-jobs-deal-with-dell-that-could-have-changed-apple-and-tech-history/?utm_source=reddit.com"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his work with Jobs. “You can’t be following the rules and making amazing things happen. Steve was certainly exceptional in that regard,” Dell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFyfe"&gt;Jony Ive, Jobs’ close friend, collaborator, and Apple’s former chief design officer offered his memories of Jobs yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-steve-jobs-memories-10th-anniversary-11633354769?mod=e2tw"&gt;in an editorial for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;My understanding of him refuses to remain cozy or still,” Ive writes. “He truly believed that by making something useful, empowering and beautiful, we express our love for humanity ... I miss Steve desperately and I will always miss not talking with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jqdt2"&gt;Apple’s memorial video is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;available to view on its site&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on Jobs and Apple’s outsized impact on the world at large, you should listen to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast"&gt;the current (fifth) season of &lt;em&gt;Land of the Giants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All Facebook Gaming creators can co-stream now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2MZIoh4YqcHEDW-pQlqwqoPBeQ=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954916/acastro_210722_1777_facebookgaming_720.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1MPeHv"&gt;Facebook is adding co-streaming to Facebook Gaming, a useful feature the Twitch competitor has lacked &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/facebook-launches-fb-gg-gaming-video-hub-to-compete-with-twitch/"&gt;since it launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, while Twitch’s version of a co-streaming feature — &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-squad-stream?language=en_US"&gt;“Squad Stream”&lt;/a&gt; — requires you to be a Twitch Partner, Facebook is making co-streaming available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwoK8d"&gt;“With co-streaming, we aim to increase discoverability for creators, encourage collaboration between creators and elevate the overall viewing experience,” Facebook explains. In short, streaming the same game alongside someone else is mutually beneficial. Actually starting a stream involves tagging up to three other creators during stream setup or after you’re live. If the other creators tag you back, then your audience is launched into a “co-streaming viewer experience,” according to Facebook. Besides being a method to introduce creators to each other and their audiences, co-streams also allow viewers to see the same game from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image: Facebook" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKrBID8WLY5Vgi3BF0s_UszwrMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902492/Co_play_UI_ScreenOnly_100421.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what co-streams will look like on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="taVWZa"&gt;Both Twitch and Facebook Gaming viewership &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331623/twitch-facebook-gaming-pandemic-hours-watched"&gt;blossomed during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with Facebook Gaming up 82 percent year over year in terms of hours of watch time. Adding co-streaming and not requiring streamers to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a partner — Facebook’s process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323148/facebook-gaming-partnership-twitch-affiliate-level-up"&gt;is known to be somewhat grueling&lt;/a&gt; — could help make Facebook’s platform grow even more appealing. Hopefully, co-streaming makes the prospect of building an audience that much easier, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taylor Swift fans are getting caught up in the Virginia gubernatorial race</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="55th Academy Of Country Music Awards - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4bTd_NJBiAzW2Y_5C1q73ZTlew=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954930/1272912319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ACMA2020/Getty Images for ACM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7x2Ley"&gt;Weeks before Virginia’s gubernatorial election, the campaign for Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe is reaching out to an unexpected constituency: Taylor Swift fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvCMJA"&gt;On Tuesday, the McAulliffe campaign launched a series of Facebook, Instagram, and Google search ads highlighting his opponent Glenn Youngkin’s role in the controversial purchase of Taylor Swift’s master recordings in 2019. The buyout of Swift’s masters has been a point of bitter contention for the singer and her fans and could be an unexpected liability in the upcoming race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwSsLY"&gt;Last year, Youngkin — the Republican nominee for Virginia governor — retired as co-CEO of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group before launching his 2021 gubernatorial bid. At Carlyle, Youngkin worked with the media executive Scooter Braun to acquire Big Machine Label Group, taking control of all of Swift’s master recordings and, for a time, refusing to sell them back to the singer. Several months later, Swift called on Carlyle to intervene in the deal, saying that the acquisition made it more difficult for her to perform her own music and produce her Netflix documentary named after her record &lt;em&gt;Reputation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQw4x6y2nfGlw1YHvUL7JmpjK0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902614/unnamed_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Terry for Virginia&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeEcud"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/business/taylor-swift-carlyle-scooter-braun.html"&gt;In a Tumblr post at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Swift wrote that the purchase of her masters put Braun in the position of “controlling a woman who didn’t want to be associated with them. In perpetuity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PT3Gvm"&gt;The McAuliffe five-figure ad buy will target voters who like Swift and engage with her content across Facebook and Instagram, according to the campaign. They will also place ads in Google search results for Virginians that search for her name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKvW1z"&gt;The ads include images of Swift and Youngkin interlaid with the hashtag #WeStandWithTaylor, a popular tag used by fans and Swifties to show support throughout the artist’s battle with Braun. Last November, Braun sold the rights back to Swift in a deal believed to be worth more than $300 million, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/scooter-braun-sells-taylor-swift-big-machine-masters-1234832080/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUU8OD"&gt;As of October, the Virginia gubernatorial race is in a dead heat. &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;most recent poll analysis, McAuliffe is projected to win 47 percent of the vote, whereas Youngkin is projected to win 44 percent, putting either candidate in striking distance of a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Tl6Jt"&gt;Enthusiastic fan bases have proven to be essential tools for political candidates over the last few years. Sen. Ed Markey’s (D-MA) young supporters helped him turn the tides of last year’s Democratic Senate primary against then Rep. Joe Kennedy III. At least one volunteer for the campaign identified themselves as a former Swifty. Last August, there were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408407/ed-markey-stans-fandom-politics-massachusetts-primary-joe-kennedy"&gt;at least 100 Twitter stan accounts&lt;/a&gt; backing the senator, including accounts like @harries4markey and @barbz4ed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJMANB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgMejv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I want to taste an AI-designed flavor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPZcxDW-SPlve7Vx_HdnJF9d8FM=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954792/HK_05_5S2A0948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Scentronix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehZjvN"&gt;When I cook, I typically just Google a recipe or try one out on the fly. But in the future, it’s possible artificial intelligence might help me concoct a meal or assist a chef as they write their next cookbook or design a menu. In today’s&lt;em&gt; Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; AI episode, we explore the world of AI product design — how far could AI go in helping humans design smells and tastes? For that discussion, we chat with Frederik Duerinck, the founder of ScentTronix, which is part software, part hardware and attempts to make customizable perfumes based on individual people. We also talk to Michael Spranger, COO at Sony AI, about how Sony is helping chefs design recipes and maximize flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KIave"&gt;Finally, we take it a step further and ask whether it’s even possible for a computer to eventually smell and taste. We all get to learn about e-noses together! Saket Navlakha, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, guides us through the world of algorithms, AI, and scent. (Thank fruit flies for his work.) Check out the episode below, and stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;every week for all the tech talk you need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google just announced its Pixel 6 event on October 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1viXulFX7xk2ZqDKhU7vWRABs4=/371x0:3596x2150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954788/FA8qbJ0VQAsbGif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qW1dRE"&gt;Google traditionally holds an October hardware event to reveal its new Pixel phones. This year, it already announced them — here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. But the company clearly hasn’t said &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; it wants to say publicly quite yet, because &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;it just announced a virtual event for October 19th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBce9g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OWYrKO"&gt;On October 19, we’re officially introducing you to Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro—the completely reimagined Google phones. Powered by Tensor, Google’s first custom mobile chip, they’re fast, smart and secure. And they adapt to you. #Pixel6Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;And though Google got out ahead of some of the leaks this year with its early Pixel announcements, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. We’re intrigued by what we’ve heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;about the Pixel 6’s Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;, which undoubtedly deserves some sort of deep dive, and we’re still waiting to hear if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Google’s first folding-screen Pixel&lt;/a&gt; will see its rumored 2021 reveal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrt8U6"&gt;Plus, of course, we’re still waiting for Google to formally announce when it’ll release Android 12. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;already reviewed the update&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but Google was only willing to say that a push to Pixel devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;will begin in the “next few weeks.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UL7spL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"},{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"},{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"Google Pixel 6 teaser gives first real-world look at the upcoming phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0Xz6JM"&gt;We’re having quite a run of big gadget events this fall, having just finished &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s September iPhone 13 and iPad event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 and Laptop Studio event&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements"&gt;Amazon fall hardware event last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uhr6I"&gt;We’ll have coverage of the Google event (according to the invite, we can expect a “pre-recorded livestream”) this October as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iTmXG"&gt;Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, has signed a deal to continue streaming exclusively on the Amazon-owned streaming platform. The deal locks down one of Twitch’s most important creators for the foreseeable future, and it comes at a particularly important time, since Twitch lost two major streamers to YouTube Gaming in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8moJg"&gt;Just to give you an idea of just how big Kolcheff is, the &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers"&gt;unofficial metrics site TwitchTracker&lt;/a&gt; says he has more than 28,000 subscribers, making him one of the most-subscribed streamers on the platform. If he had been convinced to stream on another site, it would have been a big blow for Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;THE SHOW GOES ON! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SE93iSIFe0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SE93iSIFe0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Nickmercs (@NICKMERCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS/status/1445426865565483011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhx0fx"&gt;The streaming talent wars kicked off in August 2019, when Tyler “Ninja” Blevins defected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;from Twitch&lt;/a&gt; to the Microsoft-owned streaming platform Mixer. That led to an intense period of streamer shuffling as some of the biggest players signed exclusive deals with Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932354/shroud-twitch-mixer-channel-search-hide"&gt;Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, and other platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977702/disguisedtoast-twitch-facebook-gaming-hearthstone-teamfight-tactics-jeremy-wang"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Db7bo"&gt;While the deal-making has cooled as of late (in part because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;Microsoft shut down Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, removing an entire streaming platform from the market) in recent weeks, the ecosystem has shown signs of shifting again. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;Ben “DrLupo” Lupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar&lt;/a&gt; announced exclusive streaming deals with YouTube Gaming within days of each other — and nearly two years after they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;signed deals&lt;/a&gt; with Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfP7zv"&gt;In response to an emailed question about whether or not he considered switching from Twitch, Kolcheff said “yes and no,” and highlighted how he produces content on other platforms every day. “That said, there is currently nothing like streaming on Twitch,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7V7zo"&gt;Terms weren’t disclosed for Kolcheff’s new Twitch deal. But I’d guess that Twitch may have dug deep into its coffers to entice him to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is getting rid of IGTV, sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikGjvnlzHqgKzQt23gnO4PYzVso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954505/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKSX8b"&gt;Instagram is finally acknowledging that IGTV, its first big push into video, didn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58ivKh"&gt;Today, the company is rebranding IGTV as “Instagram TV,” and it’s getting rid of the exclusive IGTV video format. Videos posted to the main Instagram feed can now run up to 60 minutes long — a length previously reserved for IGTV videos — and you’ll no longer have to leave the main app to view them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUy9lK"&gt;A spokesperson for Instagram says the IGTV app, now called the Instagram TV app, will remain as a “destination for people to visit with the intent of watching video.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgHQaud6HLT7XcEvWAhYou5fSlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902533/244367723_884783532474523_6124902347763306887_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Feed videos and IGTV videos will be consolidated into Instagram TV, which will get a single tab on profile pages. Reels will remain discrete.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQcpkI"&gt;IGTV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484436/instagram-igtv-video-app-launch"&gt;introduced in June 2018&lt;/a&gt; and was essentially meant to become a mobile equivalent to YouTube, creating a space to discover and watch longer videos. But the longer format never caught on. And just two months later, an app called TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-douyin"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcap6T"&gt;Instagram has since refocused its video efforts on rivaling TikTok with its short video format Reels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels launched in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and Instagram has aggressively pushed forward with them, giving them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;a central spot in the app’s navigation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537297/instagram-reels-ads-launch-globally"&gt;starting to sell ads&lt;/a&gt;, and cross-posting them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;into Facebook’s News Feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvXr66"&gt;Reels still has one major shortcoming, though: it doesn’t offer a consistent way for creators to get paid out, as YouTube and TikTok do. Facebook plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2022. Some of that money has gone to Reels creators, but it’s not a dedicated system for videomakers to get paid — always a good way to encourage people to make things on your app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rCRZyVU_HTDIuU5P5hl6VNkYGxE=/142x0:1299x771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954097/Screen_Shot_2018_06_05_at_2.36.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dx59nZ"&gt;The final new fighter coming to &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;was revealed as Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the event, hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, culminated in some arguably bigger news. The three mainline &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; games are coming to the Nintendo Switch. This includes &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMQ7H2"&gt;Notably, all three titles will be delivered via cloud streaming instead of native ports, so they won’t be stored locally on your Switch. Nintendo showed the games running on PlayStation 4 during the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s96Y2Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-q6Gz_4Yqc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3839&amp;amp;start=3839" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1mg2J"&gt;Prices and release dates for each of the games weren’t detailed during the stream, but Sakurai stated that the release date will be announced later. It’s hard to say how &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; will look and feel while streamed over the internet instead of played locally. Other games, like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, also have cloud versions on the Switch, and the experience wasn’t as bad as I feared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzUrVa"&gt;If this &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; release gets similar treatment, Nintendo will likely offer a free trial period for the games to make sure that your internet connection can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox web store integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming and wish lists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXNGIOSclbKBRQEBeWlQ3jSrHWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954095/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2q3rFZ"&gt;Microsoft is starting to roll out a new Xbox web store that integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud), wish lists, and more. The new Xbox web store includes buttons to add games to wish lists, quick access to redeem codes, and full Xbox Cloud Gaming integration. If you’re an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you can simply click play on a supported game, and it will instantly stream from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KLNpl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tamelucas/status/1445184671864741890"&gt;Twitter user tamelucas&lt;/a&gt; first spotted the new Xbox web store yesterday, and it only appears to be live in Canada. It’s very different from the usual Microsoft Store listing and has a design that’s similar to the rest of the Xbox UI. You can also use the web store to quickly install games to an Xbox console you own or buy the game as a gift for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5PQ7tXUUE22t8OKKZb1pD4PMxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902451/UFX1HGF.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox web store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBLbek"&gt;If you’re interested in trying the new Xbox web store, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fgames%2Fstore%2FHalo-Wars%3A-Definitive-Edition%2FBPRPQSKXTD1L%2F0001%2F9V55MMP1XDBZ&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710708%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out this listing for &lt;em&gt;Halo Wars: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft hasn’t officially announced this new Xbox web store, but given it’s already appearing in Canada, we’d expect to see it roll out generally to other regions very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destiny 2 arrives on Xbox Game Pass for PC on October 12th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D_ZPOWB_qgY71UlVqmKuF4M3yLI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953872/bungie_net_metadata_beyondlight_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gsclnz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is finally arriving on Xbox Game Pass for PC later this month. While the looter shooter has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335483/destiny-2-xbox-game-pass-release-date-microsoft-bungie"&gt;available on the Xbox console side of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year, PC players have been patiently waiting for it to be included on Xbox Game Pass for PC. Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/05/xbox-game-pass-update-october-2021/"&gt;now bundling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; on Xbox Game Pass for PC on October 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2OtR0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; developer Bungie made some clear optimizations for the console version of the game on Xbox Series X last year, with support for 4K resolution at 60fps on both the Xbox Series X and PS5. The PC version launching on Xbox Game Pass for PC won’t be any different from what’s already available on Steam, but it will mean cross-play players will see a new Windows logo next to Xbox Game Pass for PC players, instead of the familiar Steam one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q38goH"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; will include the &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; DLC with its stasis-freezing abilities, Bungie has already made it clear that &lt;em&gt;Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s next big expansion, won’t be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639582/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-expansion-release-date-gjallarhorn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will continue the story of the sci-fi space series and see players finally face off against Savathûn, the Witch Queen. &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen &lt;/em&gt;launches on February 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
