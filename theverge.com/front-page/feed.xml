    <title>TCL’s wearable display glasses will go on sale in July starting in Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3b46YwLlJplTwcmzi0FDXB8izM=/0x364:2456x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498420/Product_with_Model_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucvKEu"&gt;TCL says its wearable display will go on sale in July starting in Australia for $899 AUD (about $680 US), with more markets to follow. The company has been teasing the concept for a couple of years now and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;showed it off earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; at virtual CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7SGtt"&gt;TCL calls it NxtWear G and emphasizes that it’s not a VR or AR device in its current configuration. Instead, it acts as an external display for your mobile device or laptop, with two 1080p Micro OLED panels that give the effect of looking at a 140-inch screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sTusS"&gt;The wearable display works with phones, tablets, and laptops that offer USB-C DisplayPort functionality, including recent MacBooks, iPad Pros, and Samsung S21 series phones. The glasses plug directly into your device, displaying content on a 16:9 screen in front of your eyes. The whole thing, cable included, weighs 130g (4.6oz), and stereo speakers are built into the frames, though TCL recommends using wireless earbuds or a headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2OGnU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10619182"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXcHwq"&gt;Among other global announcements timed for Mobile World Congress, TCL is announcing a new screen-sharing function for its smartphones called Multi-Screen Collaboration. At launch, it will work only with the TCL 20 Pro 5G and will allow owners of the phone to wirelessly share files, photos, clipboard content, and messages with a compatible Windows 10 laptop or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbHahI"&gt;Photos and videos can also be shared from the phone to a TCL TV. In this mode, the phone acts as a trackpad so you can move a cursor around the TV screen to select images or clips to play. TCL says the feature will come to the 20 Pro 5G via a software update in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movetime Family Watch 2 is designed for school-aged kids who aren’t quite ready for a smartphone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z8sFnG"&gt;TCL is also previewing another new wearable — one for the kids. Movetime Family Watch 2 is a kid-oriented version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419659/tcl-10-tab-max-mid-move-audio-s200-family-watch-announced"&gt;4G-enabled smartwatch designed for seniors&lt;/a&gt;. It features a 1.54-inch screen along with voice and video calling. There’s real-time location tracking and a geofencing feature, an IP65 rated housing, and up to seven days of standby time on its battery. It will be sold in Europe starting mid-August for €149.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google delays blocking third-party cookies in Chrome until 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAMeLh1lg41Lh1MMSZ_TYcAWPP0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498180/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8BlVuz"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones"&gt;announcing today that it is delaying its plans&lt;/a&gt; to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year or so later than originally planned. Other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already implemented some blocking against third-party tracking cookies, but Chrome is the most-used desktop browser, and so its shift will be more consequential for the ad industry. That’s why the term “cookiepocalypse” has taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBvFjC"&gt;In the blog post announcing the delay, Google says that decision to phase out cookies over a “three month period” in mid-2023 is “subject to our engagement with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).” In other words, it is pinning part of the delay on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532862/google-uk-regulator-competition-and-markets-authority-privacy-sandbox-floc"&gt;its need to work more closely with regulators&lt;/a&gt; to come up with new technologies to replace third-party cookies for use in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u6ROg"&gt;Few will shed tears for Google, but it has found itself in a very difficult place as the sole company that dominates multiple industries: search, ads, and browsers. The more Google cuts off third-party tracking, the more it harms other advertising companies and potentially increases its own dominance in the ad space. The less Google cuts off tracking, the more likely it is to come under fire for not protecting user privacy. And no matter what it does, it will come under heavy fire from regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, publishers, and anybody else with any kind of stake in the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGqILa"&gt;Finding a way to balance those conflicting incentives has proven difficult to say the least. One reason is that, as a steward of the open web, Google is attempting to develop its new privacy technologies out in the open via the usual process of creating web standards. It has bundled several efforts under the rubric of a “&lt;a href="https://privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;,” a catch-all term for a bunch of different new proposals for Chrome and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDZobr"&gt;The most contentious of those proposals has been the “Federated Learning of Cohorts” technology, or FLoC. It is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;very complicated attempt&lt;/a&gt; to create groups of demographically similar users in a semi-anonymous decentralized system that advertisers could use to target ads. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387492/google-floc-ad-tech-privacy-browsers-brave-vivaldi-edge-mozilla-chrome-safari"&gt;not a single other browser vendor has signaled that it is on board with using FLoC&lt;/a&gt;, and several have explicitly said they would block it. The best response Google has really gotten is this &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-analysis-of-floc/"&gt;analysis from Mozilla that identifies some problems&lt;/a&gt; in a way that doesn’t completely slam the door on future Firefox adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRFIQF"&gt;Google is pointing to a “rigorous, multi-phased public development process, including extensive discussion and testing periods” for FLoC and other proposals, a fairly obvious signal that it will end up changing or replacing FLoC. “We plan to conclude this origin trial in the coming weeks and incorporate input, before advancing to further ecosystem testing,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdJDuw"&gt;The company is promising a “more detailed schedule” will be posted on its &lt;a href="https://privacysandbox.com/"&gt;Privacy Sandbox website&lt;/a&gt;. But in the meantime, here’s its current schedule — complete with a note that this revised timeline will need to be approved by regulators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="sXtUKT"&gt;After this public development process, and subject to our engagement with the CMA, our plan for Chrome is to phase out support for third party cookies in two stages:&lt;br&gt;Stage 1 (Starting late-2022): Once testing is complete and APIs are launched in Chrome, we will announce the start of stage 1. During stage 1, publishers and the advertising industry will have time to migrate their services. We expect this stage to last for nine months, and we will monitor adoption and feedback carefully before moving to stage 2.&lt;br&gt;Stage 2 (Starting mid-2023): Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies over a three month period finishing in late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rN0NkT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Series S is available for $10 off at Costco right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vml56v0zVZF08amtD6pVcBxeLf8=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69498128/twarren_200909_4177_0032.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Xbox Series S offers many of the same features as the Series X, but a fraction of the cost. | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xUsQKQ"&gt;Amazon Prime Day is officially behind us, and while many of the event’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/6/23/22546806/prime-day-leftover-deals-apple-headphones-video-games-sale"&gt;best deals still linger&lt;/a&gt;, some retailers are already moving on to bigger—or at least different—things. Take Costco, for example, which is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-series-s-all-digital-console.product.100784872.html"&gt;members-only deal on the Xbox Series S&lt;/a&gt; online, dropping the price from $300 to $290. The next-gen console shares many of the same characteristics as the Series X, yet, it has a slimmer build, less storage, and no disc drive. It also has less processing power, though, it’s still compatible with all the same games, as well as most Xbox One titles. It’s a small discount, but the Series S is hard to come by at any price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hu6tV9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ZEBqjL"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KpYFKo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bYplOw"&gt;By all accounts, it’s been a rough six months for the team behind &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. Despite the disastrous launch, however, developer CD Projekt Red has continued to patch the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397638/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-biggest-game-ever-sales"&gt;highly successful&lt;/a&gt; follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3, &lt;/em&gt;squashing bugs and addressing fixes that made it impossible to play on last-gen systems. If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543298/cyberpunk-2077-playstation-store-ps4-warning"&gt;Sony’s recent warnings&lt;/a&gt; are any indication, it’s still not there, but PS5 and Xbox Series X owners should have far less trouble playing the ambitious RPG, especially with a free next-gen upgrade coming in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLmsoT"&gt;If you’re a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S owner, you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744281188663338099#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Warner-Bros-Xbox-One%2F973645137%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227292927973%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D354677390340%26wl4%3Dpla-762963988014%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D973645137%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9T4u5oYdkeHoCx1-6u4gn6kY5X-ds0qAtUltKqPT6lAqstlzqqIZSxoCcQwQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now for $20, the biggest discount we’ve on the title to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="8KZHfg"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Zj3P5b"&gt;Best Buy has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744334239823225284#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished models of Apple’s AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; for $169.99, a discount of $80 off their new list price and about $30 less than they typically sell for. The AirPods Pro are the best true wireless headphones if you are fully embedded in Apple’s ecosystem, as they pair seamlessly with Apple devices and switch between them easily. They also include active noise cancelation, something you won’t find on the standard AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BAT0fI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10621896"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hLez8x"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="StZlio"&gt;A few remaining Prime Day deals of note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GRUA4g"&gt;Again, Prime Day is over, but we’d be remiss not to point out at least some of the remaining highlights below, just in case you were unable to take advantage of the two-day affair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo won’t charge extra for its upcoming electric vehicles with lidar sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fqr0pN"&gt;Volvo plans on offering the lidar — and artificial intelligence-powered safety features — of its upcoming electric vehicle as standard, but the Swedish automaker plans on charging extra for its semi-autonomous systems, like the hands-free Highway Pilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxe5uF"&gt;Volvo’s fully electric successor to the XC90 SUV, to be revealed in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;will have two new components that have never appeared on a Volvo vehicle before&lt;/a&gt;: a lidar sensor produced by Luminar and an onboard “autonomous driving computer” powered by video game hardware manufacturer Nvidia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZC7WlU"&gt;Those two pieces of hardware will help enhance Volvo’s traditional safety features, like automatic emergency braking and blindspot detection, before the company is ready to start rolling out more autonomous features to customers, said Volvo chief technology officer Henrik Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiMHxu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a new level of safety in all the vehicles”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh1d4g"&gt;“Standardizing the lidar technology and the compute platform will provide our consumers with a new level of safety in all the vehicles that are affected,” Green told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0XY5a"&gt;Offering this new equipment as standard also gives Volvo a leg up on data collection, which will help with the inevitable push toward autonomous vehicles, Green said. “With this system installed on the thousands of vehicles that we will provide to our customers, we can harvest data and accelerate the development of the autonomous drive system,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjQV3j"&gt;At that point, the more highly automated features, like hands free driving on the highway, will come at a cost to customers who wish to update their vehicles. “We see a business opportunity, of course, to have that on subscription or as an upfront payment,” Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup61v"&gt;Volvo has said that it will roll out Highway Pilot as part of its next big platform update, the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA2), which will arrive with the next-generation XC90 SUV in 2022. SPA2 will also underpin the automaker’s upcoming electric vehicles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21455850/polestar-precept-electric-car-concept-android-production"&gt;the Polestar 3 SUV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917697/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-ev-photos-hands-on"&gt;the XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Luminar lidar embedded in the company’s test vehicle. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4scPXi"&gt;Thanks to Luminar’s lidar and Nvidia’s Orin system-on-a-chip, these forthcoming vehicles will have the ability to “see” its surrounding environment and “think” about its next moves with such accuracy that it can “override” the human driver in situations where a collision might have otherwise been inevitable, Green said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLnbz1"&gt;“We know that the probability that we are right is higher than the probability of the human, which means that we can override the human in certain situations where we could see what otherwise [might] lead to a collision or an impact,” he said. Volvo’s current collision avoidance system, Green added, does not have that predictive capability and must exclusively rely on the vehicle owner to drive to the best of their ability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ueeFfm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Luminar is using lidar to help build the ‘uncrashable car’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533711/luminar-lidar-autonomous-vehicle-hands-on-demo-austin-russell"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pD9mwx"&gt;Volvo is one of the few automakers to include lidar in its future production vehicles. The laser sensor used to be very expensive, with one company selling units for $75,000 each, but that price has come down over the years. Luminar, the Florida-based company that is supplying Volvo’s lidar, has said it hopes to price its sensors at $1,000 per unit, with the goal of getting that number down to $500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L1XRj"&gt;Austin Russell, CEO of Luminar, said that Volvo’s decision to sell its vehicles with his company’s sensors as standard speaks to the importance of safety to the Swedish automaker. “When it comes to fundamental safety, the question is should it really be optional?” Russell said. “There’s no airbag upgrade package or seatbelt upgrade package.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IztVzP"&gt;Russell said Volvo’s decision to include lidar in passenger vehicles will give it an advantage as the auto industry continues its slow progression to automated driving. “A lot of the other automakers really went all in on the robotaxi side of the game, almost ignoring the core passenger vehicle business,” Russell said. “That’s actually a real opportunity to see this happen and see this through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctnOk2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 is surprisingly solid on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68MyXpJJOBajG5B8zvPN7zZJHfU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497997/THPS_Switch_9_THawk.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Ry0Kl"&gt;We’re more than four years into the life of the Nintendo Switch, and yet in some ways the handheld device remains an enigma. Namely: when there’s a port of a big game, you never quite know what to expect. Sometimes you get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22169262/doom-eternal-switch-review"&gt;a welcome surprise like &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, other times a mess like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Which why I was only cautiously excited about &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4"&gt;an excellent-yet-awkwardly named remaster of the first two games in the series&lt;/a&gt; — making its way to the Switch. This is a game where movement and flow is paramount; if frame rate hitches get in the way of a good run, it’s not really worth playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meXhgc"&gt;Thankfully, from what I’ve played, &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; is a surprisingly solid port. It’s not the ideal way to play, but it definitely works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMoSoi"&gt;First, the obvious: the game doesn’t look great. This is especially true if you’re coming off of the recent next-gen updates for the game, which made an already excellent-looking skating title look even better. On the Switch, meanwhile, the game has a flat, simple look, particularly when it comes to the textures, which can be blurry or muddled. On next-gen consoles the skaters look incredibly close to their real-world counterparts; on the Switch they’re more like PS3 characters. It doesn’t look bad, necessarily, but definitely dated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="5tVygP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9355637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1WKI4"&gt;This is actually good news. If the developers had focused on the visuals, the performance would almost certainly suffer. It’s a tradeoff that has to be made with these ports, and the team at developer Vicarious Visions has made the right choice. I’d much rather a bland-looking &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; game that plays well than the opposite. And that’s exactly what the Switch version is. During the few hours I spent with it, I didn’t experience any significant slowdown or frame rate drops. Obviously it’s not a technical showcase — it runs at a solid 30fps — but I was shocked at just how well the game ran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DstSF5qvMQkngeylTuuK5XOCvVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677660/THPS_Switch_7_TJones.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fgqyp3"&gt;As always, whether that tradeoff is worth it really depends on your personal preference. Technical showpieces are great, but so is being able to play something as slick as &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; wherever you want. (The franchise actually has a checkered history on portable devices, with a handful of excellent isometric &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; titles on the Game Boy Advance that are now lost to time.) Combine the Switch’s portability with the brilliant &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack and a good pair of headphones, and you have a very zen experience. Which is exactly what you need to hit some of those high scores. Really, the only thing that interrupted my flow was drifting Joy-Con controllers, which I can’t blame on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWpAxx"&gt;It’s safe to put &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; in the “good” column of Switch ports. Visually it’s a noticeable downgrade, but that’s to be expected. If you want the most technically capable version of this remaster, you certainly won’t find it here. But that’s fine: the whole point is being able to play a slick, modern version of these games on the go. And in that, at least, the Switch version of &lt;em&gt;THPS&lt;/em&gt; delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmKVzn"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches on the Switch on June 25th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Microsoft’s Windows 11 event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wbc7b8rA19wjKXtXlEG_i11B8U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497805/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCm3vF"&gt;Microsoft is hosting a special Windows event later today where we’re expecting the company to unveil Windows 11. Microsoft has been teasing a “next generation” of Windows for months, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;leaked copy of Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; suggests we’re going to see a number of changes during Microsoft’s event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDu2FZ"&gt;Microsoft is expected to focus on new UI improvements to Windows, including a new Start menu, rounded corners, and more simplifications to using Windows 11. We’re also expecting to hear more about a new Windows store that will offer better access to apps, and some multitasking and gaming improvements to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gOLRnC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 11 event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22543253/microsoft-windows-11-event-date-time-what-to-expect-rumors"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Mk2DaD"&gt;The event should run for around 45 minutes, which gives Microsoft enough time to talk through the important aspects of Windows 11 ahead of a deep dive for developers later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lu9iPJ"&gt;WHEN DOES THE WINDOWS 11 EVENT START?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;It starts at 11AM ET / 8AM PT / 4PM BST. Following the event, a special developer session will also be available to watch online at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE WINDOWS 11 EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j0z316"&gt;We’ll embed the event livestream up top once it’s available. Otherwise, head to these links below for more:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beeple and the founder of Pitchfork are launching an NFT site where you can buy moments in time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A box containing a digital display, which shows an image of Andy Murray kissing a trophy after winning Wimbledon in 2013." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xNMonweQnR03-w_3DlUiXBbTTA=/0x114:2732x1935/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497818/WENEW_Physical_Artifact_On_Display_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some sales include a digital display showcasing the moment being purchased.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wenew&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z8dBgH"&gt;After selling an NFT &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; in March, Beeple is making his next big move in the digital art space: he’s launching an NFT platform that’ll sell “iconic” moments in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqWeV"&gt;The platform, called &lt;a href="https://we.new/"&gt;Wenew&lt;/a&gt;, is co-founded by Beeple and some longtime collaborators. They’re also bringing on Ryan Schreiber, the founder of &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;, as Wenew’s editor-in-chief. Schreiber will help curate the moments sold on the platform, which will include highlights from the careers of athletes and artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gJyxP"&gt;“We’re definitely looking at this as sort of immortalizing these moments of human achievement for collectors,” Schreiber told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The same display and box as above but presented on a shelf." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_IUcPoGKPG0rr29dX1ocJTVjSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22676612/WENEW_Physical_Artifact_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wenew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wenew calls the digital displays “physical artifacts.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ufzu1T"&gt;Wenew’s first NFT series catalogs Andy Murray’s journey to winning Wimbledon in 2013. You’ll be able to buy his emotional runner-up speech from 2012, some of Murray’s best shots from 2013, and his eventual victory speech, among others. Or to be more specific, you’ll be able to buy a limited-edition digital file &lt;em&gt;representing &lt;/em&gt;those moments since that’s all an NFT really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHimeQ"&gt;The NFTs will be priced from $49 to $4,999 each, and some of the more expensive ones will come with actual memorabilia — a signed poster, tickets to Wimbledon 2022, a replica trophy, or a digital display. At the very high end, Wenew will be auctioning off an NFT commemorating Murray’s game-winning point, and the buyer will also get 30 minutes to play tennis with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcS1yi"&gt;“A lot of things in the NFT world feel like a cash grab right now, and we wanted to put storytelling first,” Michael Figge, a Wenew co-founder, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ivhe5t"&gt;NFTs face a few perpetual questions — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;starting with, simply, “why?”&lt;/a&gt; — but Wenew at least tries to answer the question of “what are you actually buying?” The initial buyers get something real out of the purchase, in addition to the nominal bragging rights that typically accompany an NFT purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oRn58"&gt;The format is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA’s Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; platform, which turns game highlights into virtual trading cards (albeit without any IRL extras). They’ve been a huge success for the NBA so far, with more than $500 million in sales in just its first six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="KG1OwQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The potential to actually be able to make what they deserve to make”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPebZu"&gt;Wenew wants to expand on that idea by reaching back in time and across different disciplines. The company plans to move into the music space, too, which is part of why Schreiber is on board. His job is to find major athletes and artists and build story arcs around them, identifying where NFTs can be sold along the way. The NFT sales will be accompanied by feature-length stories from journalists meant to explore why these events mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UUYdS"&gt;There’s also the outstanding question of how many musicians Wenew can get on board. NFTs have been controversial in music spaces — “I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse,” Zola Jesus &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/11-indie-musicians-on-how-theyre-navigating-the-nft-wave/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month — and broadly criticized by artists for their energy use and climate impact. Schreiber sees them as a way to “redefine” the relationship between artists and their benefactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VEbi4O"&gt;“It offers them the potential to actually be able to make what they deserve to make, frankly, off of their work,” Schreiber said. Figge said the platform will include a carbon offset fee that “more than offsets that NFT’s transaction costs to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL0U6U"&gt;Wenew’s website launches today, and its first NFT sales begin on July 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ransom notes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gI0yiEPC9ldpKFsIJ4b9qDKM-w=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497861/acastro_210616_4635_0001.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro and Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ransomware funds more ransomware, so how do we stop it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4ZCXnv"&gt;Pretend, for a moment, that you are the president. This ransomware thing is escalating. Like, hackers screwed with the gas supply on the East Coast — nightmare! You’re going to have to make some policy decisions to make these attacks end because that’s the scale of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDfoIB"&gt;Let’s begin with the obvious, uncontested fact: the number of ransomware attacks is going up because companies are paying the ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="viDYBB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The number of ransomware attacks is going up because companies are paying the ransoms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l47fo9"&gt;The Colonial Pipeline hack is a case in point. The company spent $4.3 million to unlock its computers. Ransomware is just extortion, after all. As the DarkSide collective put it in their &lt;a href="https://www.databreaches.net/we-are-apolitical-darkside-threat-actors/"&gt;weirdly corporate apology&lt;/a&gt; for shutting down Colonial Pipeline, “Our goal is to make money.” Major &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/"&gt;cybercrime gang Evil Corp&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8835987/mr-robot-usa-pilot-rami-malek-christian-slater"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;branding btw — &lt;a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/12/12/the-fsb-s-personal-hackers"&gt;reportedly likes sick Lambos&lt;/a&gt;. Stopping ransomware is simple in that way: all you have to do is cut off the cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZ5StG"&gt;The question is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, and none of the choices are very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWCfWC"&gt;You could require the immediate disclosure of ransoms. You could ban paying ransoms outright. You could ban cryptocurrency, which is how most ransoms are paid. You could increase regulation around cryptocurrency and perhaps ban certain kinds of exchanges or transactions. You could try being better friends with Vladimir Putin, in the hopes that he might sacrifice some threat actors. Your Department of Defense has also probably come up with some separate terrible ideas, which I am frightened even to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCGxon"&gt;Every choice here hurts, at least in the short term. But let’s go through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5bzMM5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate disclosure of ransom payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tVp51T"&gt;Legislators have been trying to get ransom disclosures done already, without much success. That’s probably because the public disclosure of a hack damages a company’s reputation. So right now, we actually don’t know the true extent of the ransomware problem because a lot of companies keep hacks quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dv1tNv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“And there goes my hopes for the leverage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PQGGhb"&gt;Immediate disclosure would at least give us a better sense of what’s going on, but there would be a cost: hackers would get more leverage. Like, hackers create leverage &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; by making a hack’s existence public, which creates pressure on the company to get things back to normal — by paying up. Cybercriminals create leverage in uglier ways, too: emailing and calling employees or clients of the victim company to tell them about the hack, says Ali Arateh, managing director of Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU8fT9"&gt;In early June, security researcher Kevin Beaumont tweeted that he’d send out a thread of the biggest ransomware and extortion victims — then he decided against it since some of the hacks weren’t public. “And there goes my hopes for the leverage,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GottMannus/status/1400234844777484289"&gt;tweeted back Mannus Gott&lt;/a&gt;, one of the ransomware groups in question, which had evidently been hoping for a public disclosure of their hack in order to better pressure the victim. “Yours was one I was looking at, at the time,” Beaumont replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="E35XLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban ransom payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="K0HKbp"&gt;Right now, it is legal to pay ransom: it’s even tax-deductible, and the money often comes from a company’s cyber insurer. Banning ransoms in the US would cut off the cash supply for the criminals — probably getting them to change their focus to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9i8uo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf"&gt;This policy is in place already&lt;/a&gt;, in a piecemeal way. The leaders of Evil Corp were &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845"&gt;criminally sanctioned&lt;/a&gt; to prevent people from paying them ransom, not because Russia would extradite them. Similarly, the North Korean nationals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287578/doj-fbi-north-korea-hack-wannacry-sony-pictures-the-interview"&gt;behind the Sony hack&lt;/a&gt; are beyond the US’s reach, though I’m sure law enforcement would be happy to pick them up if they took a vacation in a country with a US extradition treaty. If a company pays a sanctioned actor — or a sanctioned crypto wallet — it can put itself in legal jeopardy. But some still pay! About 15 percent of all ransomware payments, or about $50 million in cryptocurrency, were subject to sanctions liability, &lt;a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ransomware-sanctions-risk-2021"&gt;according to Chainalysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7GmEWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;About 1 in 4 companies that receive ransom demands actually pay&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4XGj7H"&gt;This piecemeal ban is also part of the reason we’ve seen the rise of affiliates — a banned actor like Evil Corp can sell its software product to a group that isn’t sanctioned in return for a cut of the ransom. &lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;group then carries out the hack and demands ransom, and the company pays a non-sanctioned wallet. It’s ransomware-as-a-service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jR2EdX"&gt;Still, making all ransom payments illegal &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; cut down the number of companies that hand over their money. Right now, about 1 in 4 companies that receive ransom demands actually pay, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/Gated-Assets/white-papers/sophos-the-state-of-ransomware-2020-wp.pdf"&gt;security firm Sophos&lt;/a&gt;. “In the long term, stopping ransom would probably halt this, but in the short term it would be very painful,” says Tom Robinson, the founder and chief scientific officer of Elliptic, a company that tracks cryptocurrency transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtZO8w"&gt;It would be painful for the same reason that companies often pay the ransom: they might go out of business otherwise. Many hackers deliberately target companies’ backups, says Joshua Motta, co-founder and CEO of Coalition, a cyber insurer. If the company’s backups aren’t segmented away from the rest of the network, they may be vulnerable, he says. “It’s devastating,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNZTGL"&gt;And as if that weren’t enough, a lot of hacks double-dip — they steal data as well as encrypting systems. The data can then be sold for other attacks if the ransom isn’t paid, and it may include such sensitive information as Social Security numbers lifted from payroll data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaoGOy"&gt;It might also increase cyber insurance underwriting costs, though this is debatable. According to the Sophos survey, paying the ransom actually makes hacks &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; expensive because companies still have to do some pretty serious work to fix their systems and lock them down &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; paying the ransom money. It’s unclear whether that would still be true if more companies have no choice but to rebuild their computer systems from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l4Bq7Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ban cryptocurrency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nlzy5l"&gt;Cryptocurrency’s role in the ransomware ecosystem has led some to call for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ban-cryptocurrency-to-fight-ransomware-11621962831"&gt;banning cryptocurrency altogether&lt;/a&gt;. Others have suggested &lt;a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-start-disrupting-cryptocurrencies-mining-money-transmission"&gt;regulating cryptocurrency mining&lt;/a&gt; as money transmitters to make it more difficult to process ransom transactions. “I think it’s time for a whole-of-government ‘regulate it to death’ strategy, based on existing regulation,” says Nicholas Weaver, a computer security specialist at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, in an email. This would also be a painful route to take — not only would it blow up people’s cryptocurrency investments, but it would nuke entire companies based on cryptocurrency, such as Coinbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCNdey"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ransomware as we know it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; heavily dependent on cryptocurrency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="daAvOu"&gt;It’s also not clear that banning cryptocurrency would work; most cryptocurrency is decentralized. Banning it within US borders would remove a lot of the more above-board players who are currently compliant with know-your-customer measures, while the shadier exchanges based outside the US would continue operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6rDWv"&gt;But ransomware as we know it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; heavily dependent on cryptocurrency. Ransom demands in traditional currency require banks or payment processors to be involved in the process, and they can intervene to halt payment. This was functionally what ended “screen lockers,” which demanded a credit card payment to unlock the victim’s computer, according to Ryan Olson, the VP of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42. Crypto doesn’t have the same oversight, and it also makes it easier to quickly move money across borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3S7c8"&gt;Right now, ransom payments are usually made in Bitcoin, though Samantha Levine, senior vice president at CAC Specialty’s cyber practice, tells me she’s also seen payments made in Ethereum and even Dogecoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9K5ss"&gt;There is one silver lining to cryptocurrency as a ransomware payment method: public blockchains make cryptocurrency traceable. Some cryptocurrencies, called privacy coins, are harder to track. For instance, the DarkSide group responsible for the Colonial Pipeline hack &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/"&gt;also would have accepted ransom in Monero&lt;/a&gt;, a privacy coin, but Monero doesn’t change hands as often as Bitcoin. That makes it difficult for companies to quickly acquire Monero to pay ransom. Instead, Colonial Pipeline paid 75 Bitcoin, or about $4.3 million. The FBI followed the transactions through the public blockchain to seize and recover $2.3 million in funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG2FR8"&gt;If cryptocurrency is banned outright, a lot of the privacy initiatives in that world may suddenly get a lot more important. For instance, there are &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/"&gt;services called mixers&lt;/a&gt; that let people &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-mixers-and-why-governments-may-want-to-shut-them-down"&gt;move their identified cryptocurrency to mingle with other transactions of roughly the same amount of money&lt;/a&gt;, ideally obfuscating the transaction history. Right now, most cryptocurrency players don’t use them — but if cryptocurrency becomes illegal, their use may very well rise. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-mixers-and-why-governments-may-want-to-shut-them-down"&gt;has even suggested creating a mixer on the Ethereum chain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GW8eud"&gt;Another way to obscure transactions is to use a privacy wallet, such as Wasabi, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/europol-bitcoin-privacy-wasabi-wallet"&gt;with built-in capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to make transactions hard to follow. Driving all cryptocurrency use to these kinds of wallets would make it even more difficult to trace ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="S5WvHD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger cryptocurrency regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9O85RQ"&gt;At some point, criminals need to move out of cryptocurrency and back into traditional currency since that’s generally how one pays for Lamborghinis. Within the borders of the US, cryptocurrency is already regulated; reputable exchanges comply with know-your-customer laws aimed at preventing money laundering, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sb1pgX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DarkSide, the group that was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline, “doesn’t eat in Russia”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IHZWdX"&gt;But not every exchange is based in the US, and some aren’t engaging in strict know-your-customer practices. More money associated with criminals went through the Binance exchange than any other, according to Chainalysis. Now the US government is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;investigating it for money laundering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MT50b6"&gt;While ransomware players can be anywhere in the world, there are a few places where they cluster. DarkSide, the group that was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline, “doesn’t eat in Russia,” Brett Callow, an analyst at Emsisoft, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0afb53f0-f382-442a-9a32-02824ce8bb70"&gt;told the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Its ransomware software “checks the language used by the system and, if it’s Russian, it quits without encrypting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4YRJj"&gt;One way to dodge exchanges altogether is to make arrangements on darknet markets, such as Hydra. Someone might, for instance, bury rubles in a specific location — and then, when the threat actors hand over their bitcoin, they receive the coordinates to go dig the fiat currency up, says Robinson. But it’s hard to see what people are doing on Hydra — it’s also possible that some cybercriminals might buy tools they can then use in other attacks, effectively reinvesting in their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="74bplu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International diplomacy and coordination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wg2PJ3"&gt;You could combat ransomware through international cooperation — after all, many hackers’ names and locations are known. They’re just not extraditable. But because hackers don’t target certain Eastern Bloc countries, those countries do not view ransomware as a serious problem, says Adam Meyers, Crowdstrike’s senior vice president of intelligence. “These people are paying taxes,” Meyers says. “I think there’s people protecting them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61OhbH"&gt;The Biden / Putin summit on June 16th underscores this difficulty. One of the outcomes of that meeting was to create meetings of cybersecurity experts who might decide certain kinds of infrastructure is “off-limits” to attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-putin-summit/2021/06/16/c2592718-ced4-11eb-9b7e-e06f6cfdece8_story.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But this is not the same thing as banning ransomware outright, or being able to pursue hackers, like those of Evil Corp, within Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAivEJ"&gt;In order to do that, it’s possible Putin will ask for significant concessions, such as lifting some US-imposed sanctions or otherwise making deals that benefit Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AtiLhc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RZAQVC"&gt;So where does that leave you, the president? Nowhere good. But you’re going to have to put on your decision aviators because the hacks are increasing. Even cyber insurers can fall prey to ransomware. Cyber insurer &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/cna-financial-paid-40-million-in-ransom-after-march-cyberattack"&gt;CNA was hacked&lt;/a&gt; in March and paid a ransom of $40 million. The Asia division of cyber insurer &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4443da60-6d90-4d27-b300-b0896425f99f"&gt;Axa was hacked&lt;/a&gt; in May.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMyIiY"&gt;“We called 2020 the year of ransomware, and I’m wondering if I have to call 2021 the year of ransomware, too,” says Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis. “We’re basically on track to surpass 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ByE57y"&gt;The trends she’s seen include asks for bigger ransoms and an increase in the average payments going to known ransomware wallets. And scarily, there’s more money being moved between ransomware strains and illicit service providers, says Grauer. Business is good, and the hackers are reinvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Jio collaborate on ‘ultra-affordable’ JioPhone Next </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5FA_zA0gVCFfN2dhM5-qxRqubM=/1x0:835x556/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497788/jiophone_next_google.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JioPhone Next.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jio Platforms&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kebl8C"&gt;Indian tech giant Jio Platforms has collaborated with Google on a new affordable smartphone called the JioPhone Next, Jio’s parent company Reliance announced today. The Next is aimed at helping the roughly 300 million users in India who are currently on 2G networks upgrade to 4G, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It will be released in India on September 10th, before coming to other markets at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMwfM7"&gt;Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani said the JioPhone Next would be an “ultra-affordable 4G smartphone,” but didn’t reveal exact pricing or full specs for the device. However, the company did say it will include voice assistant support, translation features, and a camera with support for augmented reality. The phone is running on an optimized version of Android OS designed specifically for the device, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/new-android-smartphone-and-5g-partnership-jio/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/jiophone-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; has spotted&lt;/a&gt; that it appears to be using the Go-version of the Google Camera app, which indicates it shares some similarities with Google’s low-powered Android Go operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ML21zZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s running an optimized version of Android&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmOZCA"&gt;Google and Jio first announced they were working together on an affordable smartphone last year, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325343/google-reliance-jio-investment-india-4-5-billion-dollars-7-percent-facebook"&gt;Google invested $4.5 million&lt;/a&gt; in Jio Platforms. Today, Google says its work with the company is also expanding thanks to a new partnership that will see Jio Platforms parent company Reliance make use of Google’s Cloud platform, shifting its core retail business onto Google’s infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuDM5G"&gt;The JioPhone Next is part of Google’s multi-year attempt to bring Android and its services to lower-powered, more affordable devices. It announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5845562/android-one-google-the-next-billion"&gt;Android One initiative in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15649380/google-budget-android-phone-program-announced-io-2017"&gt;followed this up with Android Go&lt;/a&gt; three years later in 2017. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17513036/google-kaios-investment-feature-phones-firefox-os-apps-services-strategy"&gt;invested in KaiOS&lt;/a&gt;, an operating system designed for feature phones, in order to make its services available on even more basic devices. As more and more of the developing world comes online, Google is making a big effort to ensure it’s there to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft needs to show Windows 11 is more than just Windows 10.5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-A4ae0FSSnuOh_RBV1YzFeeqVjg=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69497680/windowslogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft Design (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNXa8X3Hf7v/?utm_medium=share_sheet" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new version of Windows is coming today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GhKqsu"&gt;Microsoft is about to unveil Windows 11 this morning, the company’s next major operating system. While a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535123/microsoft-windows-11-leak-screenshots-start-menu"&gt;leak of Windows 11 has provided an early look&lt;/a&gt; at some of the design changes, I’m expecting to see a lot more today. A new Start menu, rounded corners, and a general UI overhaul have been expected for months, but Microsoft will need to show some big changes to Windows 11 to prove it’s more than just Windows 10 with a paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDbKso"&gt;A lot of what we’ve seen so far was already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;planned for Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, a version of Windows that was originally going to ship with dual-screen devices. Windows 10X included a new Start menu that acted more like a launcher, which was centered on the taskbar. 10X also featured many simplifications to the UI, and general usability improvements to Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jA6dUF"&gt;After the pandemic hit, Microsoft quickly attempted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;rework Windows 10X for laptops&lt;/a&gt;, to offer a more simplified version of its OS for devices that were suddenly in high demand for remote work and schooling. The Windows 10X attempt to simplify Windows and its app model didn’t work out. Sources familiar with the situation tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Microsoft had been struggling to hit an acceptable level of app compatibility with 10X over the past couple of years, after the company had originally planned to run every app in a special container to improve the security and performance of devices running the new OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xI6k5xCoGk3Cjzg7J2LDyTDIdXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22671569/windows11main.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLNBX2"&gt;Containers would have been a significant change to Windows, especially for developers, and there’s no sign in the leaked Windows 11 build that Microsoft plans to implement containers any time soon. Instead, Windows 11 appears to be adopting most of the UI changes that were part of Windows 10X. The leaked Windows 11 build also includes some changes to multitasking, improved support for multiple monitors, and some possible performance improvements – particularly for PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHutKY"&gt;The most significant change in Windows 11 could be Microsoft’s approach to the apps it allows in the Windows store. The leaked version of Windows 11 doesn’t include the new store, but Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;rumored to be opening its store up to any Windows app&lt;/a&gt;. That means Chrome, Adobe Creative Suite, and many other apps that don’t exist in the Windows store will suddenly be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4Ylxw"&gt;Perhaps more significantly, Microsoft is also expected to allow devs to bypass its payment system for store apps. That means developers won’t have to give Microsoft a cut of their revenue for in-app purchases, if they decide to use their own payment systems. This would be a huge change, and one that would put even more pressure on Apple’s App Store, just after Microsoft has helped Epic Games argue that iPhones are general purpose devices just like PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 multitasking UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aSRhis"&gt;Beyond the store, I’m hoping to see Microsoft differentiate Windows 11 from Windows 10 with a focus on daily users of the OS. Productivity is a key part of this, as is making Windows easier and more reliable for the millions who use it to study and work each day. Apple impressed us earlier this month with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, a simple way to use a keyboard and trackpad on a Mac to control an iPad. It makes dragging and dropping content between those devices really simple, and improves productivity if you’re using multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k189Ez"&gt;There are some hints in the leaked version of Windows 11 that there could be some multitasking improvements on the way. A new control appears on the maximize buttons in Windows 11 allowing you to quickly snap apps into place. These snap features have existed in Windows for years, though, so I’m hoping we’ll see even more changes to help Windows users improve their daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQczNZ"&gt;Beyond productivity, Windows is also used for PC gaming. A bigger effort to improve Windows 11 for gaming would be welcome news to the millions that use PCs instead of game consoles. The Xbox Game Bar and new Xbox app have been good additions, but the reality is that PC gaming is dominated by Steam and Discord. I’d like to see Microsoft recognize that, instead of trying to force Xbox-like experiences onto PC players. I think the Xbox Game Bar is a good step in the right direction, but there’s still much more Microsoft could do in Windows 11 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC gaming needs to be a Windows 11 focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rci6rx"&gt;I’m hoping Microsoft improves its Game Mode in Windows 11. The mysterious feature simply “optimizes your PC for play,” but the reality is that it does very little. When you run a game with Game Mode enabled, it suppresses Windows Update from installing drivers or trying to reboot your PC, and mysteriously “helps achieve a more stable frame rate depending on the specific game and system.” It doesn’t go far enough to limit other apps from hogging your CPU or even GPU resources, though. PC gamers often disable services, limit apps, and play with the registry instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhEkqL"&gt;Beyond these key areas, I’d also like to see Microsoft improve some of the fundamentals in Windows 11. I still have to dig into the registry to flip the direction of my mouse scroll wheel. While some mice include drivers that will change the direction, Windows doesn’t. It’s a bizarre omission, and there are many examples across Windows where Microsoft could do a better job of cleaning the OS up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdQ3cH"&gt;One of those is Settings, where I’m often thrown into the ancient world of the Control Panel to adjust settings. Microsoft keeps Control Panel around for its impressive legacy support, but it should be something you really need to dig for, not an area you randomly stumble upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfKLdqjUXFh6HSgFzTiybO1-gs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19986222/windowslinux.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 will likely include some big dev changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AGPUKi"&gt;I’m expecting Microsoft to have some surprises for Windows 11 that prove it’s not just a Windows 10.5, too. Microsoft employee Miguel de Icaza &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/windows-11-what-to-expect.html"&gt;teased on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the company will discuss something he’s spent years pushing for, before later deleting the tweet. It’s a mysterious tease for such a big event. De Icaza co-founded Xamarin, a tool for building mobile apps that can work across iOS and Android. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/24/11109942/microsoft-xamarin-acquisition-mobile-app-development"&gt;acquired Xamarin back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has been improving its developer support in Windows ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onyE9c"&gt;We’re bound to hear about improvements for Windows developers in Windows 11, and perhaps even some changes to Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396018/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-task-manager-app-throttling-features"&gt;Linux GUI apps are on the way to Windows&lt;/a&gt;, and Microsoft is also holding a separate Windows developer-focused event today, so there’s likely to be a significant dev announcement coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="su1zyl"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows 11 event will run for around 45 minutes start at 11AM ET today, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
