    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Who is Elizabeth Holmes, really?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lpIvYu"&gt;Would you rather be a failure or a fraud? Judging by the opening statements in Elizabeth Holmes’ wire fraud trial, those seem to be Holmes’ options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3gEN4"&gt;Here’s Robert Leach, assistant U.S. attorney, who is prosecuting the case against Holmes: “This is a case about fraud, about lying and cheating to get money,” Leach says. “That’s a crime on Main Street and a crime in Silicon Valley.” But according to Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, Holmes is just another failed startup leader: “In the end, Theranos failed. And Ms. Holmes walked away with nothing. But failure is not a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xPJP8I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="819WPU"&gt;Now, by the time the first day of the trial ended, the first witness had only just been introduced. There are plenty more witnesses and apparently just a whole fuckload of documents ahead of us. But my impression is that the prosecution is going to have an uphill battle to show Holmes’ &lt;em&gt;intent to deceive, &lt;/em&gt;a crucial part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh3Hw4"&gt;According to the government, Theranos didn’t start life as a fraud, so that’s nice. Instead, in 2009, Holmes was rapidly running out of money. Worse, things with its pharma partners weren’t going so well — Pfizer and Schering-Plough, two huge drug companies, had cut it loose. Theranos was having a hard time making payroll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="448cDt"&gt;“Out of time and out of money, Elizabeth Holmes decided to lie,” Leach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxvHYA"&gt;So Holmes started seeking investments, making the kind of grandiose startup claims we’re all familiar with from the tech industry. (Theranos was a medical company, but never mind.) Holmes gave revenue projections to Safeway that overestimated what Theranos could achieve, and gave Walgreens a report that suggested Pfizer had endorsed their tech. Leach’s allegations about a Pfizer memo that had been shown to investors were astonishing. See, according to him, it was forged. Pfizer’s letterhead might have been on the memo but Pfizer didn’t put it there. I expect we’ll be hearing from Pfizer about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Es5ZTK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Holmes’ own brother, who she’d hired, told her that Theranos’ pregnancy tests had problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4vboHO"&gt;Other allegations from Leach included that Holmes misled investors about Theranos’ relationship with the military — claiming that the company’s mini analyzer was deployed in military helicopters, and saving lives, when its only relationship with the military was a small 2010 study at the Army burn center in Texas. According to Leach, Holmes also deceived investors about the readiness of the analyzer. And! Despite having zero revenue in 2012 and 2013, Holmes went around telling investors that revenue would be $140 million in 2014. (It was actually $150,000.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NppExY"&gt;We’re going to be hearing from some former Theranos employees who tried to tell Holmes and Balwani that the analyzers weren’t working as promised. One of them was fired. The other was ignored. And when Holmes’ own brother, who she’d hired, told her that Theranos’ pregnancy tests had problems, she ignored him. Leach promised the jury would see “email after email” showing that Holmes was aware of the problems — but unlike the Pfizer memo, we didn’t see any specific emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZNED3"&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes’ media persona&lt;/a&gt; made an appearance as well. According to Leach, favorable press coverage was a major way that Holmes was able to raise money — saying she “approved” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;this glowing &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; and timed up a press release with it meant to lure investors. He also said that &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; contained lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq9BOf"&gt;But those pieces do contain some truths, Leach said. Holmes was in full control of Theranos. “She owned it, she controlled it, the buck stopped with her,” Leach said. “She sweated the details. She was in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="smEgFX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trusting and relying on Balwani as her primary advisor was one of her mistakes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bEhKqk"&gt;While the prosecution was specific, the defense was playing for sympathy. Wade opened by telling us about Holmes packing up her belongings into her car after Theranos went under. Then he took us back in time to Holmes dropping out of college at 19, after patenting a miniaturized system that would perform tests and give a result. According to Wade, Holmes’ co-defendant who is being tried separately, Sunny Balwani, encouraged her to drop out. “Trusting and relying on Balwani as her primary advisor was one of her mistakes,” Wade says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0EYjA"&gt;In Wade’s telling, Holmes was a wide-eyed naif — and nothing was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; her fault. See, Balwani was responsible for the clinical labs where things were going wrong for patients, and financial modeling was also his job. Walgreens and Safeway pressured Holmes into marketing herself. So, at the suggestion of a board member, she hired marketing firm &lt;a href="https://www.tbwachiatday.com/"&gt;Chiat Day&lt;/a&gt;. (Not much mention was made of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, Girl Genius&lt;/a&gt;, thought we did see an ad about Theranos’ inexpensive testing.) Also, Walgreens pushed Holmes into agreeing to a phased approach to testing — Theranos hadn’t duped it into thinking it was using its own machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8i9Ca0"&gt;Oh, and the inaccurate results? Sure, that can happen in any lab, Wade said. Holmes believed the tests were accurate and reliable and used them herself, as well as recommending them to her family. &lt;em&gt;Balwani&lt;/em&gt; had oversight of the labs, and besides, the lab directors are legally responsible for safe and accurate testing, not Holmes. Some of those lab directors are going to testify and I am &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;interested to hear what they have to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nI7de6"&gt;And although &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;two years’ worth of Theranos’ tests were thrown out&lt;/a&gt;, Wade argued that we’ll be hearing from only &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; patients and doctors who got bad results — when 8 million tests were performed. (Wade did not bring up the tests that had been voided.) Just 20 out of 8 million is an awfully small number of inaccurate tests, Wade said. He even did some showy math for the jury: that’s 0.00025 percent of all tests. This suggests that Theranos’s tests were actually very accurate and that the prosecution is cherry-picking — but it leaves out those voided tests. That is an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; omission! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mABrTs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Wade is to be believed, Holmes is responsible for almost nothing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IdFhE7"&gt;As further evidence that Holmes believed in Theranos, Wade announced that Holmes hadn’t sold any of her shares. “She passed on every opportunity to sell,” he said. She could have made hundreds of millions of dollars, but she was in it for the mission, not money, he said. Now, it’s kind of hard to sell shares of a private company — not impossible! — but I don’t know what kind of agreements might have been in place about her ownership stake. After the omission about the two years’ worth of tests getting shitcanned, I don’t buy much of what Wade is selling. What else is he leaving out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVzrSL"&gt;If Wade is to be believed, Holmes is responsible for almost nothing. She was young, after all, and a college dropout. She worked seven days a week at Theranos but somehow could not possibly be responsible for anything except her dream of success. And while Wade hinted at the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;abuse allegations Holmes made about Balwani&lt;/a&gt; — he “sometimes had a temper, could lash out, did not always treat people kindly” and in Holmes’ relationship with him, “there was another side to it that most people never saw” — he never directly argued that abuse was a factor in Holmes’ actions. I’m guessing this is because having Holmes take the stand is a risky move, and if the case hangs on the abuse allegations, she’ll have to testify to the abuse. After all, most people didn’t even know the two of them were in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="c5uh0e"&gt;This trial is just beginning, and a lot hinges on the testimony we haven’t yet heard and emails we haven’t yet seen. But the outlines of the story each side is telling are clear. For the prosecution, proving that Holmes isn’t a dimwitted figurehead might be tough — the standard, after all, is “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and Wade hammered hard on the presumption of innocence. Okay. But with so much blame being shifted to Balwani, the question arises: if the defense really wants to argue this is merely the story of failure due to naïveté, then what exactly &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;Elizabeth Holmes doing at Theranos? She was apparently breaking her back there &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; for fifteen years! Wade suggested she was primarily working on the tests and making bad decisions, but surely if that were all she was doing, she probably could have taken some weekends off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf Hyper review: where the rubber meets the foam </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmPpxrAML7IYH-Ve7WbGOxouhSw=/0x93:2200x1560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69832260/verge_sean_hollister_20210822_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nerf Hyper Rush-40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Are these new blasters really the future of Nerf?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8Nmuu2"&gt;For nearly 30 years, Nerf has been synonymous with foam — foam balls, foam darts, and foam arrows blasted across playgrounds or over cubicle walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B0sid"&gt;For its new awesome-looking Hyper blasters, Nerf brand owner Hasbro had something different in mind. To increase their performance and capacity, it charged a small team of engineers to develop a smaller projectile using a new material. They came up with a tiny ball made of thermoplastic elastomer; effectively, rubber instead of foam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXedXj"&gt;Before they could perfect that ball, the company’s designers had to build a new set of blasters to actually fire those projectiles, too. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-HF-Blaster/dp/B083QZPGX9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The $30 Hyper Rush-40&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-Pump-Action/dp/B083QZK786/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$40 Siege-50&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Hyper-SMG-Blaster/dp/B083QZLSZ5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 Mach-100&lt;/a&gt; were developed at the same time as the new rounds, they told me on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSTraO"&gt;That might be why they don’t work particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hr8LD"&gt;I’ve been testing them in my local park, my backyard, and this past month, I got to try them at an actual Nerf war. Honestly, I can’t recommend them at all. And I’m still not sure whether it’s because the ammo has fundamental limitations, or whether this first wave of blasters just misses the mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVss73"&gt;Let’s discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7IL4B3gKI29S1FtlRHjcCLCvNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835515/verge_sean_hollister_20210822_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top to bottom: Rush-40, Siege-50, Mach-100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gg26Rd"&gt;Dream vs. reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4z5zSQ"&gt;When I was a kid, you’d have to reload most Nerf blasters after every single shot. Only the biggest, bulkiest and most inaccurate two-handed toys let you do more. When I returned to Nerf as an adult, a five-shot revolver you could prime with your thumb was a revelation, and yet you’d still have to carry a bulky drum magazine to feed a rifle with more than 18 darts at a time. It was only 2017 when the company finally released &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rival-Nemesis-MXVII-10K-Red/dp/B01MG5QHC1/ref=asc_df_B01MG5QHC1/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=241949400705&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18065931603132406381&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-406502453996&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $100 blaster&lt;/a&gt; that could fit enough ammo to hold down a fort thanks to a gigantic hopper-fed system that held 100 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDR9b"&gt;So when Nerf announced its new Hyper ammo was small enough to cram 40 shots into a pistol or 100 into an SMG-sized blaster, plus paintball-style canisters to top up, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-Rival-Nemesis-MXVII-10K-Red/dp/B01MG5QHC1/ref=asc_df_B01MG5QHC1/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=241949400705&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18065931603132406381&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-406502453996&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it sounded like a dream&lt;/a&gt;: we’d finally be able to battle without constantly thinking about the next reload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KdlrE"&gt;Instead, I’m constantly thinking about whether my blaster will actually shoot when I pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k9YOaqEeIjjUbi-uvSmjIlPsp34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835611/verge_sean_hollister_20210907.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To prime the spring-powered Rush-40, you pull back on the entire slide, hopper and all. But you’ll have to point it down first. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAzvKk"&gt;Whether you pick the Rush-40, Siege-50 or Mach-100, their integrated ammo boxes all rely on gravity to feed rounds into the chamber, and these rounds don’t always want to go in. If you actually stuff 40 tiny yellow balls into a Rush-40, or 50 of them into a Siege-50, they might not have enough room to reach the chute at all. Even if you don’t, they need to slide down the slope just right to reach the inner chamber. Mess it up, and nothing will happen when you pull the trigger, just a puff of air. So far, my best bet has been to point the blaster down to the ground each time I prime it — but that means not keeping it aimed at my target. It’s a real disadvantage in a fast-paced Nerf battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JmNcb"&gt;Even with the Mach-100, which has a dedicated mechanical agitator and conveyor belt to keep the balls moving, it can be a problem: the supposedly full-auto blaster would often pop just a few balls at a time, then pause, then fart out two at once, sometimes with dramatically reduced range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_OxRfNJFgLzNmT4mvvNXDEYjacw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835554/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike the Rival Perses with its lightweight rechargeable pack, the similar Hyper Mach-100 requires 6 D batteries. I wouldn’t want to hold it this way for long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vdGYQb"&gt;And even when they do fire, you can’t expect them to go anywhere near where their blaster’s built-in aiming sights are pointed. With the Rush-40 pistol and Mach-100 SMG in particular, their shots almost immediately curve right down to the ground, forcing you to aim much higher than your target and rain balls down. I did get some tags this way, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imtUeo"&gt;It also mystifies me why Hasbro produced paintball-like hoppers and pods for easy refills without giving them a way to mate. Every time I whip out one of the cool canisters, which smartly attach to each blaster’s built-in rails, I inevitably dump a bunch of them on the ground, because the loading doors and flip-top canister don’t match up at all. Hasbro designer Rob Maschin says the team would love to change that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYOFAC"&gt;This is all a shame, because in many ways these Hyper balls are the best projectiles Nerf’s made in years. While they’re the same dimpled shape as the company’s larger foam Rival balls, the new TPE rounds are far denser and fly further. They’re &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaA_xTaRa7I"&gt;easy to wash&lt;/a&gt;, not terribly hard to pick up with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-Weasel-Small-Nut-Gatherer/dp/B0173P3O16/ref=asc_df_B0173P3O16/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=216531775325&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=4657220126082372686&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9032047&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-370918601718&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small nut gatherer&lt;/a&gt;, and their electric yellow makes them incredibly easy to spot on the ground. No word on whether they’re biodegradable should someone decide to be lazy, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhpWdm"&gt;“We produced probably a dozen different colors and just threw them out into a lawn out back to see which is easiest to see — that neon yellow popped,” Nerf brand manager Greg Nyland told me. It’s true: despite being smaller than Rival, they catch my eye at a distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xQLHlQjJ3eiQQRZhNJptaQI6oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835532/verge_sean_hollister_20210516.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tall grass doesn’t necessarily present an issue...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiwshh9tYZryrU-yTdJ8_Ey3e4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835535/verge_sean_hollister_20210904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but clumpy turf can. There are three balls hidden in this picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5MuRkR"&gt;You can even use a black light to find them at night, since they’re UV-reactive. They do bounce everywhere and roll all over the place, and could get lost in storm grates, but the only time I personally had trouble was in dense, clumpy grass where they’d fall into little pockets of turf and I had to be standing at the right angle to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0la05v"&gt;Perhaps as importantly, the blasters can spit out these rounds more powerfully than anything else Hasbro will let you buy on a shelf. I consistently saw all three blasters exceeding 100 feet per second on my chronograph, with the Rush-40 and Siege-50 regularly crossing the 115 feet per second mark. And while those balls did dive into the ground when I fired flat, I measured ranges of up to 150 feet with my distance measuring wheel after I angled shots up into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wjOiyXE8c5kJhMS9iqVMgqCYUgg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835543/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rush-40 and the Kronos are practically the same blaster but with a different ammo type.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="grhWHI"&gt;To get a sense of how much performance has changed, I compared the Hyper Rush-40 to the Rival Kronos — since the Rush is largely just a Kronos with the new projectiles on board. As you can see in the chart, the Rush’s maximum range absolutely dwarfs the Kronos, but at the expense of range when shot flat. With the old Kronos, I can sometimes hit things I see in my sights, but I found little reason to aim with Hyper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULwUE2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741937"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TV7YQy"&gt;Range isn’t the whole story, though. The Hyper rounds hit harder (I asked friends to shoot me in the face), so it’s more obvious when you’ve been tagged. They travel faster and don’t loft in the air quite like Rival rounds, so they’ll likely be harder to dodge, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctMFVT"&gt;Speaking of lofting and range, Hasbro surprisingly omitted a feature from two of these blasters typically used to improve both: a little rubber nub called a “hop-up” that adds backspin to the ball, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect"&gt;taking advantage of the Magnus effect&lt;/a&gt; to fly through the air. But the Rush-40 and Mach-100 mysteriously don’t have a hop-up, even though the Rival blasters they’re based on (the aforementioned Rival Kronos and Rival Perses) most definitely do. And while the Siege-50 has one, mine barely worked. Still, some Nerfers have &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Og-ht0nN354?t=742"&gt;already created&lt;/a&gt; 3D printed aftermarket hop-ups for the Rush-40 that seem to improve their accuracy. It’s likely Hasbro’s future Hyper blasters will, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLOejC"&gt;I’m less certain why Hyper rounds feed so poorly, but I have a theory. To make them safe, Hasbro made them squishy, and now they’re &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; gummy to avoid sticking on each other when they’re crammed into a hopper. I imagine they could even jam blasters if not for the Hyper hoppers’ tilt-down-to-load feeding chutes, which ensure only one round gets chambered at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIZYCvBTa8e57KcL8o1NVSOu4Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835619/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyper vs. Rival vs. Elite vs. Mega ammo size comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYcbNroOpMLwSJw9dU67j57o8Gw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835620/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squishing both Rival and Hyper balls. My thumb sinks into Rival a little like a pillow, while the gummy Hyper bulges out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wzMJFh"&gt;It’s tricky. If Hasbro had simply made its foam Rival balls smaller, they would have been lighter too, which isn’t necessarily helpful for speed and accuracy. But if you make them denser to fix those things, they aren’t quite as soft — and as Hasbro veteran engineer Bob DeRoche explained on the call, every single blaster the company makes has to meet its Kinetic Energy Disbursement (KED) standard for safety. “Based on the speed, the weight, the diameter, and how much that disperses, you have to be under that KED number. If it’s under that, you’re safe — it’ll hurt your eye, it won’t feel good, but it won’t damage your eye, he says.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6rC3m"&gt;Technically, every single Hyper blaster comes with a pair of safety glasses too — a first for a Nerf product, I believe — and prominent warning labels about wearing them in the field. But the primary safety mechanism was building a TPE pellet with the right squish, and the team admits that squish was a challenge for the blasters — which, remember, they had to develop simultaneously. “We didn’t have that luxury of time,” says DeRoche. “When we first got those samples of the round and got closer to what we wanted, we were still getting into the final state of not being as tacky or sticky,” adding that it was “problematic” to keep them fluffed and loose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xku9bQ"&gt;That’s why Hasbro decided to start with hopper-fed blasters to begin with, as opposed to compression feeding systems like a spring-loaded magazine. Nyland suggests we shouldn’t rule out other feeding mechanisms, though, pointing to just how much Nerf’s Rival line evolved since its 2015 debut, too. I have to admit he’s got a point: &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/nerf-rival-review-the-evolution-of-foam-warfare-1730896686"&gt;the first Rival blasters showed off serious potential&lt;/a&gt;, but their tiny magazines and terrible ergonomics were vastly improved just a couple years later. I’d be excited to see co-branded &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; blasters that can actually fit a decent number of shots inside, but I wonder whether the gummy rounds will ever work in a truly enclosed space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A6lurj"&gt;The competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SqAmc0"&gt;But the real reason to skip Hyper — for now — isn’t any of these issues. It’s that Hyper doesn’t compete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB4ZDH"&gt;Not only does Hyper require you to buy into a new, unproven ammo type that likely won’t be available at your local Nerf war, Hasbro’s expecting teens and young adults to see them as the blaster of choice for sporting-grade Nerf, and that’s just not the reality today. The sporting part of the Nerf community is increasingly standardizing on half-length of the same size of dart that Hasbro’s blasters have used for years, to the point nearly every player at my last Nerf war had at least one short dart blaster in their loadout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y11ga"&gt;Modern short darts from brands like Worker and Dart Zone fly so straight you can consistently hit things you aim at. They’re cheap, too: typically between 8 and 10 cents per dart, compared to the 15 to 21 cents you’ll pay per Hyper ball right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AyalQZsCAr52niuU_fM-t22wYk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835617/verge_sean_hollister_20210907_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At $40, I’d buy a Dart Zone Conquest Pro over a Nerf Hyper Siege-50 any day of the week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="np2GvQ"&gt;And you don’t need to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"&gt;the kind of incredible 3D printed blasters we featured here&lt;/a&gt; to get started, because an upstart rival named Dart Zone is making it increasingly easy to get into short darts, too. For the same $40 you’d pay for Hasbro’s Hyper Siege-50, you could hit up a Walmart for the similar pump-action-shotgun-esque &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-Conquest-Pro-Half-Length-Ultimate-Dart-Blaster%2F185917597&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dart Zone Conquest Pro&lt;/a&gt; instead, and have 15 darts that actually fly where you aim them with just as much power and without the feeding issues. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-Pro-Blaster-Ammo-Clip-Refill-Compatible-with-Nexus-Pro-Aeon-Pro-and-Conquest-Pro%2F476510661&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 more buys a pair of additional magazines&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAdventure-Force-Tactical-Strike-100-Half-Length-Pro-Dart-Refill-Shoots-Over-125-FT%2F809673491%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26wl13%3D2031%26adid%3D22222222420449455996%26wmlspartner%3Dwmtlabs%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D501107745824%26wl4%3Dpla-293946777986%26wl5%3D9032047%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Dlocal%26wl12%3D809673491%26wl13%3D2031%26veh%3Dsem_LIA%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwvuGJBhB1EiwACU1AiX0wrzxpgItQh7nSJEEwEbA9uySZFYYznU2JDWfTJ1CndnRZbrX91BoC8wUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 additional darts&lt;/a&gt;, compared to $12 (on sale!) for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NER-H-Refill-Canister-50/dp/B0851GQJ1G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a canister of just 50 Hyper rounds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vK2A4Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The engineers building ridiculous dart blasters that Nerf won’t touch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gw9tVp"&gt;I was able to keep some foes pinned down with the Mach-100, and I got some tags with the others too, but I spent most of my time wishing I had something more reliable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Do4kK6"&gt;Perhaps the biggest thing I don’t understand about Hasbro’s foam-flinging strategy is why it let this competition go unchecked, instead of building better darts itself. It was Nerf that popularized the foam dart &lt;a href="https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Nerf/History"&gt;some 29 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but the competition’s short darts and even full-lengths fly so much better than any projectile Hasbro has ever made. Perhaps that’s intentional for safety reasons, or for fun? (I do remember when dodging darts all &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt;-style was a great part of the game.) But Walmart seems perfectly happy to carry Dart Zone’s more powerful and accurate blasters, and without requiring bundled safety glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WzaAH6"&gt;Maybe Hyper will surprise us, but after this slow start and the company’s forgettable Ultra and Elite 2.0 lines (both of which performed worse than previous blasters in a number of ways), I’m hoping Hasbro might take a harder look at how it can truly compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzsVNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9jfUV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, more than 30 percent off the typical list price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $90 ($45 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids+ service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. We’ve seen the Kindle Kids Edition drop to as low as $70 during Amazon Prime Day, which is its current price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;As far as deals go, you can currently pick up the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support for $85 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition at Amazon for $105&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHnfba6HB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 32GB Paperwhite with ads for $110; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $130 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon is running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $125&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $115&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $140&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="JA82PQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Google settles with worker allegedly fired for his workplace activism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z09WWoC_zhwdLcsWCe8VaMjVrZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831999/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6N0gM6"&gt;Google reached a settlement with a fired employee who the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims was let go from the company for his workplace activism, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-08/google-settles-with-employee-allegedly-fired-for-activism?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The employee, Laurence Berland, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout"&gt;fired in 2019&lt;/a&gt; allegedly for violating Google’s data security policies. He had been a vocal critic of Google’s work with the US Customs and Border Protection and was terminated amid internal organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS1ix5"&gt;The settlement was approved in July by the NLRB, though the terms haven’t been revealed, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JGpO7"&gt;The NLRB has accused Google of violating labor law &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421969/google-illegally-firing-three-workers-nlrb-president-biden"&gt;in firing Berland and four other workers in 2019&lt;/a&gt; over organizing activities and is still battling Google over those accusations. One employee, Kathryn Spiers, was allegedly fired for creating an internal pop-up message reminding workers of their labor rights; Google said she didn’t have the proper approval for sending that code, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;according to Spiers&lt;/a&gt;. The other employees, including Berland, Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke, say they were fired for &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/google-fired-us-for-organizing-were-fighting-back-d0daa8113aed"&gt;participating in protected labor organizing&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/3/20992786/google-workers-fired-nlrb-laurence-berland-rebecca-rivers-sophie-waldman-paul-duke"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; they were let go for violating the company’s data security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood opens up a slow and steady approach to crypto investing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAx739oeJkBvBYXjsyshW26hazM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831985/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dDfHN7"&gt;Robinhood is &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/9/8/crypto-recurring-investments-are-here"&gt;rolling out a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets you automatically invest in cryptocurrencies on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. The investment app says this service will let you automatically invest in things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/commission-free-cryptocurrency-investing/"&gt;other supported cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; without a commission fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNfTJL"&gt;Before we go any further, though, I should warn you that nothing in this article is qualified or expert financial advice. It’s probably wise to talk with an expert who can help you come up with an investment strategy that’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJnKju"&gt;Robinhood’s approach here is automatic investing, not trading. It won’t sell the crypto for you when an algorithm decides it’d make financial sense to do so. Instead, it’s just steadily building your crypto portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ULJEeFxrxuBnYWeERs0Vog40w8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22835317/Recurring_Flow_9_8_Update.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Robinhood&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of what recurring crypto investments looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q26ozn"&gt;Robinhood pitches this as a way to do “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdJgJqEOOQ4"&gt;dollar-cost averaging&lt;/a&gt;,” which is more or less financial speak for not worrying about what the market is doing and instead investing the same amount regularly, letting the gains and losses come out in the wash. In other words, you’re adhering to the financial maxim “time in the market beats timing the market.” Of course, in this case, the market isn’t an index fund or anything like that; it’s cryptocurrencies, which have a reputation for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660932/crypto-exchanges-el-salvador-bitcoin-price-dip"&gt;being rather volatile&lt;/a&gt;. Whether the strategy works for Bitcoin et al. is probably a question for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/crypto-ceo-uses-dollar-cost-averaging-to-buy-bitcoin.html"&gt;more finance-focused publications&lt;/a&gt; and experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3acWX"&gt;The concept of “HODLing,” or holding, has long been a meme in the crypto and WallStreetBets communities. They’ll sometimes encourage people to keep their stocks through whatever losses may come in hopes of selling them for a profit in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGdjbQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Robinhood’s approach is a traditional finance method applied to crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYdwIQ"&gt;There are other cryptocurrencies that try to reward users for holding in different ways. Coinbase has been giving users extra coins for &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/07/coinbase-will-now-reward-users-for-holding-this-cryptocurrency/"&gt;keeping certain cryptocurrencies since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That kind of system is actually the basis of an alternative mining system called proof-of-stake, which looks to solve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;the energy demands&lt;/a&gt; of the more traditional proof-of-work systems. In proof-of-stake systems, miners put up their crypto as collateral for a chance to create a block, and if they're chosen, they’ll get a reward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV35pI"&gt;However, Robinhood’s approach is much more in the vein of traditional finance methods, just applied to new tech. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that the feature isn’t available to users in New York, a major financial center in the US. The company says that the feature will be “gradually” rolling out to its users throughout the month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Addison Rae signs Netflix film deal after going from TikTok to He’s All That</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“He’s All That” Special Screening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1BHQXVzFpM6AHTUMpvA-grxOMc=/0x0:4988x3325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831966/1336432090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vivien Killilea/Getty Images for Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xd8D2W"&gt;Netflix is doubling down on TikTok star Addison Rae with &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/addison-rae-enters-multi-picture-creative-partnership-with-netflix"&gt;a new multi-picture film deal&lt;/a&gt; that could see the social media celebrity bringing even more eyes to the streaming service, As part of the deal, Netflix will develop projects specifically for Rae to star in and executive produce (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/addison-rae-tiktok-netflix-hes-all-that-1235052075/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e15qed"&gt;The motivation seems to be the early success of &lt;em&gt;He’s All That&lt;/em&gt;, the gender-swapped remake of &lt;em&gt;She’s All That, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433195/tiktok-influencer-addison-rae-miramax-gender-swapped-shes-all-that-remake"&gt;first announced in September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The company projects the film will be watched by more than 55 million households in the first month of release and says it reached #1 on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows"&gt;the company’s chart&lt;/a&gt; “in 78 countries, including Brazil, France, and Saudi Arabia.” Critical reception to&lt;em&gt; He’s All That&lt;/em&gt; has been mixed, from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22643642/hes-all-that-review-netflix-remake"&gt;surprisingly positive&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/tiktoker-addison-rae-promotes-some-brands-in-netflix-s-1847556794"&gt;rightfully dismissive&lt;/a&gt;, but that might not matter. Netflix’s director of family film Naketha Mattocks believes Rae’s promise is “undeniable as evidenced by&lt;em&gt; He’s All That &lt;/em&gt;and her already passionate fan base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Ixn1G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Social media stars are breaking through on streaming platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NZjLOB"&gt;Netflix’s numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt, though. The company doesn’t open its full data up to others, and its metrics for what counts as a “view” are very different from a box office receipt or Nielsen rating. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075927/netflix-the-witcher-viewer-numbers-length-metrics-q4-2019-earnings"&gt;watching at least two minutes of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;counts as a view by Netflix’s standards. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313325/apple-tv-plus-billie-eilish-documentary-numbers-box-office-streaming-netflix-hulu"&gt;Some of that opaqueness&lt;/a&gt; and “flexibility” is par for the course in the streaming era, but it’s worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shYtPN"&gt;Still, Rae is immensely popular, with around 84 million followers on Tiktok alone, so it follows she’d bring some kind of audience to whatever future projects Netflix cooks up. Along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189180/charli-damelio-dixie-hulu-reality-series-documentary-tiktok-kardashians"&gt;the similarly TikTok famous D’Amelio family&lt;/a&gt;, Rae is part of a recent wave of influencers and creators trying to push into other mediums. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/02/damelio-rae-netflix-hulu/"&gt;There’s been concern they’d falter&lt;/a&gt; in ways similar earlier online stars did while transitioning to old-school forms of showbiz razzle-dazzle, but Rae’s deal may be a sign things are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The LAPD built collecting social media info into its interview process for civilians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LAPD officers being under an order to wear masks." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qA8OuTp22bc7nB0wd2upDSAiYw=/0x0:2069x1379/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831830/1234644879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zANvuB"&gt;The Los Angeles Police Department asked officers to gather social media information as a standard part of their interviews with civilians, whether or not the people were implicated in a crime. The practice, revealed in public records &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/lapd-documents-reveal-use-social-media-monitoring-tools"&gt;obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a larger LAPD social media monitoring strategy — one that’s similar to other US police department policies but may go beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JigbTU"&gt;As the Brennan Center notes, &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/D.%20Beck%20FI%20Memo%202015.pdf"&gt;a 2015 memo&lt;/a&gt; from LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck told the department that “similar to a nickname or an alias, a person’s online persona or identity used for social media and communication can be highly beneficial to investigations and possibly even future outreach programs.” Beck said that officers should collect “social media and email account information” when filling out field interview report forms — which were updated to specifically ask about social media data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK3Ip3"&gt;Previous reporting has indicated that the LAPD aggregates field interview information &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/training-documents-palantir-lapd"&gt;into a database&lt;/a&gt; run by surveillance company Palantir. Officers are allowed — but not required — to enter field interview cards for &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-26/lapd-division-gang-framing-scandal"&gt;anyone they come into contact with&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly collecting social media data could leave people who are stopped by police vulnerable to additional online surveillance regardless of whether they’re officially under investigation. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/08/revealed-los-angeles-police-officers-gathering-social-media"&gt;An LAPD spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the interview forms were being “updated” but didn’t describe what the update includes, and the LAPD’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyn3Pj"&gt;The newly released documents also offer more details about how the LAPD has worked with online surveillance companies — a practice many police departments participate in. In 2016, the &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/Dataminr.pdf"&gt;LAPD apparently employed&lt;/a&gt; Twitter analytics firm Dataminr (whose access Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/15/13969110/twitter-dataminr-fusion-center-geospatial-data-surveillance"&gt;later limited&lt;/a&gt;) to receive alerts around shooting and bomb threats, but also to track the movements of anti-Trump protesters on May Day. The department also used tracking service Geofeedia (which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/13/14909248/facebook-platform-surveillance-policy-developers-data"&gt;cut off by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/H.%20Search%20terms.pdf"&gt;monitor protest-related keywords&lt;/a&gt; including #BlackLivesMatter and #FuckDonaldTrump. More recently, the LAPD has apparently entered a contract with Media Sonar — &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/2.%20Media%20Sonar%20Promotional%20Material.pdf"&gt;which pitches&lt;/a&gt; the ability to “automatically find digital footprints in the matter of seconds.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund pledges $150 million to climate justice groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos Speaks At The National Press Club" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rDGwDVk8r-l4vlGbUGagQtt6r8c=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831745/1169506493.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos speaks during a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Sept. 19, 2019. | Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v96T8M"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $10 billion Earth Fund just doled out millions more in funding to groups fighting off climate change. This time, a lot of the cash is going to groups that advocate for communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, which often face the first and worst effects of climate change and fossil fuel pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmBMCI"&gt;The fund &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-grants-from-the-bezos-earth-fund-emphasize-climate-justice-pro-jobs-climate-action-and-innovation-in-decarbonization-301370952.html?tc=eml_cleartime"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a total of $203.7 million in new grants today. Of that, more than $53 million will go toward communications on climate change and efforts to cut emissions from businesses. Another $20 million will go to groups focused on climate justice — a movement to stop climate change from taking a disproportionate toll on already marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mbgybv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A movement to stop climate change from taking a disproportionate toll on already marginalized communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1XzwR0"&gt;The Earth Fund plans to work with the Biden administration to disburse the biggest chunk of funding, $130 million, by the end of the year. That’ll go to organizations supporting a Biden administration initiative called Justice40 that the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in January. It’s a plan to ensure that disadvantaged communities receive 40 percent of the “overall benefits” from federal investment in new infrastructure and climate solutions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RMR1kQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today the Bezos Earth Fund announced its commitment of $150M this year in support of environmental justice groups implementing the Justice40 Initiative. Disadvantaged communities have borne the brunt of environmental damage for too long and are key actors in driving solutions.1/2&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Steer (@DrAndrewSteer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrAndrewSteer/status/1435574312401096704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKvhEv"&gt;The announcement comes after Bezos faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;flak from activists&lt;/a&gt; for not earmarking enough funding for communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The fund allocated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;$791 million&lt;/a&gt; to environmental organizations in its first round of giving last year. A majority of that went to big green groups, including the World Wildlife Fund and Environmental Defense Fund, with deeper pockets than scrappier climate justice-focused organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjz6ej"&gt;“We have to run and put our finger in so many different holes,” says Dwaign Tyndal, executive director of the Boston-based nonprofit Alternatives for Community and Environment. “We carry so much of this work, relative to the resources that are allocated ... Many of our groups are Black and brown, Indigenous groups and somehow that money has not trickled down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vFIsG0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many of our groups are Black and brown, Indigenous groups and somehow that money has not trickled down.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IfLmmg"&gt;While activists say today’s announcement makes good progress on climate justice, it still falls short of the level they’d like to see when it comes to investments in the most vulnerable communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aljsi"&gt;“The Bezos fund is improving, but they still have some ways to go,” says Maria Lopez-Nuñez, a deputy director of organizing and advocacy at the Newark, New Jersey-based Ironbound Community Corporation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q3fTx"&gt;She wants to see at least 40 percent of investments from both Bezos’ Earth Fund and Biden’s Justice40 initiative flow into communities hard hit by climate disasters and pollution. Currently, roughly 30 percent of all the Earth Fund grants (including the “pledge” to give an additional $130 million later this year) have gone toward environmental justice initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeVqUd"&gt;The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, which advocates for Gulf Coast communities like Louisiana’s “cancer alley,” is one of the Earth Fund grantees named today. Cancer alley earned the moniker because of how its residents have coped with the health &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086172"&gt;hazards from more than 150 refineries and chemical plants&lt;/a&gt; in the region. After &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/06/us/hurricane-ida-cancer-alley-pollution/index.html"&gt;Hurricane Ida hit the area hard&lt;/a&gt; last week, local organizations like RISE St. James are scrambling to &lt;a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2021/9/8/hurricane_ida_sharon_lavigne"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; oil spills and chemical releases that the storm unleashed. The aftermath of Ida is an example of why similar grassroots groups need funding, activists tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RQDScD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want the real deal.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8RPUKw"&gt;Surrounding Bezos’ new round of funding is a much larger national debate over how to ensure that the Justice40 program serves those most in need. Activists and policymakers are still working to define &lt;a href="https://grist.org/equity/new-york-environmental-justice-policy-defining-disadvantaged-communities-clcpa-justice40/"&gt;what constitutes a disadvantaged community&lt;/a&gt;. Once that’s hammered out, they’ll also need to figure out what it looks like for those communities to receive 40 percent of “overall benefits” from federal investments. The language doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll get 40 percent of the actual funding, so community organizers like Lopez-Nuñez aren’t sure exactly what they’d be given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niXPcs"&gt;“We don’t want byproducts. We want the real deal,” says Lopez-Nuñez. The real deal for Lopez-Nuñez is direct investment in vulnerable communities, not the undefined “overall benefits” of funding streams that communities themselves don’t control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwRIsJ"&gt;Even though Bezos has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22563671/andy-jassy-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; from his role as Amazon’s CEO, his climate legacy is still marred by the retail giant’s pollution, say activists like Lopez-Nuñez. The company has been the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; of campaign after campaign by residents living with pollution from Amazon’s warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Efg75W"&gt;“The Earth Fund is a complicated fund, given how Bezos has made his wealth on the exploitation of workers and the environment,” Lopez-Nuñez says. “[The money] comes from our communities; it’s been extracted from our communities, at the cost of our health.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0b7sTV"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;lots of expectations for a new Series 7 model&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22648593/apple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch"&gt;Apple’s “California Streaming” event on September 14th&lt;/a&gt;, however, the new editions might bring larger sizes in addition to higher price points than we often see with the current models. Each Apple Watch offers ample functionality, and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 6, which starts at $399 for the GPS model or $429 with cellular connectivity. If that seems too expensive, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which also launched nearly a year ago at $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt; and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE and Series 6 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in either white or black, which is $30 off its usual retail price. If you are looking for the Series 3 in the larger 42mm configuration, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s flagship, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikPbUG"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped white version of the SE for $249 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XX59T/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers are also currently offering the same model in black for $269 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-Regular%2F585668092%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the 40mm blue and pink models have the biggest discounts at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5LPB6G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with each retailing for $329. The overall prices among all Series 6 watches can wax and wane on nearly a day-to-day basis, so keep your eyes peeled and be sure to check our usual daily deal roundups as well as weekly newsletter for the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $349, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Blue-Aluminum-Case-with-Deep-Navy-Sport-Band-Regular%2F253347819%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white models&lt;/a&gt;, are available for $379 and $371, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA sets new date for James Webb Space Telescope launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8I905fOz9SxBpBKEzLuMrxZeB68=/0x500:7466x5477/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69831613/webbcomplete3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JxScVZ"&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope, humanity’s next big space-bound eye on the cosmos, has a new launch date of December 18th, NASA announced on Wednesday. It’s the latest among dozens of other delays for a telescope that was originally planned to go to space as early as 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HK0luF"&gt;The $8.8 billion observatory, named after NASA’s second administrator, is a tennis court-sized successor to NASA’s famed Hubble telescope. Its 18 hexagonal gold-plated mirrors will allow the spacecraft to view distant planets and the far reaches of the universe with a level of detail that far surpasses Hubble’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeY4hp"&gt;Astronomers have been looking forward to the telescope’s launch for years, but its development has been set back by years of delays, development challenges, and cost overruns. NASA and Northrop Grumman, the telescope’s prime contractor, initially set a $1 billion budget for James Webb and a launch date for sometime in 2007. By 2011, the launch date had slipped to 2018, but that was pushed ever further, with development accidents driving up costs. Early last year, NASA’s inspector general &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21112504/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-delay-gao-audit-march-2021"&gt;foresaw delays due to a handful of technical challenges&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327601/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-october-31-2021"&gt;pandemic added more delays last year&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the launch date to October 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDMJ7r"&gt;The latest delay had nothing to do with the telescope. The Ariane 5 rocket James Webb will launch on was effectively grounded for nearly a year due to problems with its payload fairings that were detected in two separate commercial missions in 2020. The rocket successfully launched a batch of satellites in July. In the same month, the European Space Agency — NASA’s partner on the telescope — signed off on James Webb’s new launch plan in a key review that showed “positive results” during technical evaluations, the agency said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7s67ZZ"&gt;NASA &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-readies-james-webb-space-telescope-for-december-launch"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the new date was set in consultation with Arianespace, the French company whose Ariane 5 rocket will send James Webb to space from a launch site in Kourou, French Guiana managed by the European Space Agency (ESA). The observatory, a joint project between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian space agency, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-s-james-webb-space-telescope-has-completed-testing"&gt;wrapped up final tests&lt;/a&gt; late last month, and now it’s undergoing shipment operations. Engineers will enclose the spacecraft in a custom (and very expensive) shipping container before it’s sent to Kourou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odGG6K"&gt;While it &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; has a new launch date to space, the exact timing of when the spacecraft sets sail to South America is still being kept under wraps as a security precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
