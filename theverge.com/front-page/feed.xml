    <title>The Office is leaving Netflix, but its first two seasons will be free on Peacock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_ZnadpbdVnW9ScOZxuX8Xb3sTE=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512209/theofficepeacock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peacock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34ETVF"&gt;The end of an era is approaching: &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;will leave&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Netflix on January 1st and exclusively move over to Peacock, NBCUniversal’s streaming service. Peacock confirmed the January 1st launch date today and explained how viewers can watch all 201 episodes of the show. The first two seasons will be available for free, but seasons 3 through 9 will require a paid subscription. Viewers can either pay $4.99 per month with ads or $9.99 monthly without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbKASM"&gt;Peacock’s building out an entire experience around the show, which will likely be an important one for the service and potentially encourage many more people to subscribe. Subscribers can view extra material, like behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, and interviews as well as curated collections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuYrKg"&gt;The loss is a big one for Netflix, although the company knew the date was coming. The show’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;widely considered one of its most popular with more than 52 billion minutes watched in 2018, some 3 percent of all Netflix minutes watched in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-battles-rivals-for-its-most-watched-shows-friends-and-the-office-11556120136"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pweoFa"&gt;As Netflix loses more of these comfort watches, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035338/friends-netflix-leaving-january-2020-hbo-max-may-streaming-seinfeld-the-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll have to rely on its in-house content to maintain its subscriber base, while also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;charging more&lt;/a&gt; so it can keep making shows. It’s already cranking out content routinely, which gave it a major advantage in 2020 when most video shoots were sidelined because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But now, Netflix is entering the new year with the loss of one major show and a backlog of content to shoot and prepare for the service. It might have a rough year or two ahead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229587/netflix-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-streaming-entertainment"&gt;depending on when shooting resumes&lt;/a&gt; and how well its competitors are able to produce their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxEC2d"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite gets a performance mode so it runs better on older PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYMbsSwitObdg8xetnfpl5BR7t0=/195x0:2991x1864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512110/Fortnite_20201202100316.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pPaxdr"&gt;It’s no mean feat that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; manages to run as well as it does on just about any conceivable platform — from mobile to Switch to high-end gaming PC. Today, in a post on its blog, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-performance-mode-boosts-pc-fps"&gt;announced a feature called performance mode&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow older PCs to run the game better. It’ll be available on December 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2d3hEa"&gt;The new mode “offers significant performance gains by trading out visual quality to lower memory usage and lighten the load on CPU and GPU,” the company writes, meaning the game will look less good so it doesn’t torch your hardware. (Users running &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on older hardware will see a prompt about the mode when they boot up the game.) Epic also bundled in a feature that allows players to remove high-resolution textures from the game’s install, which should save a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; amount of hard drive space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvRJvX"&gt;Epics claims users running the new mode will see a huge boost in frame rates on older machines, as compared to the previous low-performance settings. You’ll be able to use performance mode in both Battle Royale and Creative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uneb5SuNrpBJmT2Aq06zhRF6t28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169959/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_3.28.27_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FPS gains in performance mode on representative hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yIaStG"&gt;This is all to say it might finally be possible to run &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in 720p at 60 frames per second, even on that old gaming laptop you still have lying around. Don’t get rid of it! That’s your backup &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; box now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucOWgH29SVMu29YDXtDmOe_DUac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169963/skyline_1280x719_39f166862842.png"&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds Live Translation to Alexa’s toolbox of skills</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tIdPVHJPu3u3xI-gjFAJw7niKg8=/53x0:1199x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512080/AlexaLiveTranslation.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KF8AsU"&gt;Alexa is gaining the ability to do live translations between English and Spanish, German, French, Hindi, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazon-launches-a-live-translation-feature-for-echo-devices/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;a new update Amazon announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The update joins Alexa’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22088394/amazon-alexa-multilingual-support-italian-german-french-shopping-fire-tv"&gt;expanded multilingual skills&lt;/a&gt; that were added in November to make the assistant a more capable non-English speaker and translator on devices in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhsDbp"&gt;Live Translation can be initiated with a voice command like “Alexa, translate Spanish.” Alexa will play a beep to signal that you can start speaking with your partner and then translate your conversations live, even displaying a live transcript on the screen of Echo Show devices. Amazon sees this as being useful for talking with visiting friends and family from abroad or in a hotel setting through the Alexa for Hospitality platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqxOCy"&gt;In support of the new skill, Amazon also says it modified Alexa &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazon-launches-a-live-translation-feature-for-echo-devices/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;to better handle natural pauses in conversations&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to changes to Alexa’s tolerance for end-of-sentence breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DRA371"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Assistant’s interpreter mode translates 27 languages|62134" data-volume-uuid="ee25af6cb" data-volume-id="62134" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-689" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVk40V"&gt;While we haven’t been able to give Alexa’s Live Translation a thorough test, the skill sounds very similar to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9234753?hl=en"&gt;Google Assistant’s Interpreter Mode&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18170806/google-assistant-translate-languages-real-time-interpreter-ces-2019"&gt;originally announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Our first demo of Interpreter Mode was admittedly rough, but at launch, Google attempted to handle 27 different languages, far more than Alexa currently supports, along with offering a similar ability to display a live transcript on devices like the Nest Hub. Whether Alexa is able to be more accurate and eventually support more languages seems to be where Live Translation can differ the most from Google’s offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9R1yYQ"&gt;Amazon says Alexa Live Translation is available now on Echo devices in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft roll out new benefits for California drivers under Prop 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-RIDESHARE-DEMONSTRATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDrScGmw8D2-pTNDxBxGu_uia9s=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512026/1227939563.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJhZXn"&gt;Following their victory last month in California on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;Prop 22 ballot measure&lt;/a&gt;, Uber and Lyft have unveiled the new “benefits” for California drivers on their platforms, including guaranteed minimum earnings and stipends for health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVb1kR"&gt;“Even though we’ve won the vote, we’re still not done,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a blog post announcing the benefits&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In fact, we’ve only just begun to improve independent work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e0bqV"&gt;Gig economy companies, including Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;spent more than $200 million&lt;/a&gt; on the “Yes on 22” campaign. Prop 22 exempts them from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20841070/uber-lyft-ab5-california-bill-drivers-labor"&gt;AB5, a California state law&lt;/a&gt; requiring them to treat their workers as employees. The companies said AB5 would increase wait times and prices for customers, while taking flexibility away from drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8pKBxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prop 22 allows the companies to continue categorizing drivers as independent contractors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYLwGu"&gt;Prop 22 allows the companies to continue categorizing drivers as independent contractors and also provide some additional benefits. Opponents argued that the provisions in Prop 22 were not equal to the economic security of full-time employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxrCGZ"&gt;Under Prop 22, gig workers — including ride-share drivers — will be paid 120 percent of California’s minimum wage of $13 per hour, which increases to $14 per hour in 2021. For ride-share drivers, this applies only during active hours: when they have a passenger in their vehicle or are en route to pick up a passenger. It requires workers with 15 active hours a week to receive a health care stipend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjd6kq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fblog%2Fcalifornia%2Fp22-independent-work%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174600%2Fuber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber’s benefits program&lt;/a&gt; calls for drivers to be paid at least 20 percent more than the pickup city’s minimum wage plus 30 cents per mile for expenses. That 30 cents per mile doesn’t apply to delivery workers on foot or bicycle. Drivers who earn less than the guaranteed minimum over a two-week period will be paid the difference automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flBT7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Fhub%2Fposts%2Fprop-22-passes&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174600%2Fuber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lyft’s pay schedule is similar&lt;/a&gt;, with its first guaranteed earnings period beginning on December 16th. At both companies, drivers who earn more than the guaranteed minimum will keep all of their earnings — there is no upper limit. They’ll also keep 100 percent of their tips&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1iwem"&gt;For health care, Lyft will provide a quarterly health care subsidy for drivers who drive an average of at least 15 hours per week. To qualify, drivers have to provide proof they are enrolled in a qualifying health care plan. Uber’s health care stipend also requires an average of 15 hours per week, and drivers have to prove they are the primary policyholder on a qualifying health insurance plan. Uber drivers receive 50 percent of the stipend — amount still TBD — if they average 15 active hours a week and 100 percent of the stipend when they average 25 active hours per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rrDqU"&gt;Drivers can qualify for the health care subsidies beginning on January 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk7t9Y"&gt;To cover the costs of the new benefits, Uber said it would apply a fee of up to $1.50 to the cost of rides and up to $2 on meal deliveries, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/166601bd-584c-41f8-b1d2-b46afd0c9782"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Lyft did not provide details on any additional customer fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWtOH5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)"&gt;Prop 22 mandates&lt;/a&gt; current ride-share drivers receive safety training before July 1st, 2021. Drivers who sign on after January 1st will be required to complete the safety course before they take their first trips. Drivers will also be required to take breaks of at least six hours if they drive more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period, and they will be enrolled in injury protection insurance that covers medical expenses, disability payments, and survivor benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Voting machine company demands retractions over conservative media’s ‘disinformation’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US Election Voting Ballot booth (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vDlIKn7MY7630J09B0Tcr9O5GlM=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511931/election-voting-machine-stock3_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InCAUP"&gt;On Monday, electronic voting system company Smartmatic demanded three conservative media outlets to retract claims that its machines skewed votes in favor of President-elect Joe Biden in November’s US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9JVpu"&gt;Smartmatic issued &lt;a href="https://www.smartmatic.com/us/media/article/smartmatic-demands-justice-for-defamation/"&gt;retraction demand letters&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News Network, according to a press release published by the Florida-based company Monday. In the letters, Smartmatic identifies several “factually inaccurate statements” made by the three conservative outlets throughout the 2020 presidential election cycle. These demands are often a precursor to a defamation lawsuit, although it is unclear whether Smartmatic will pursue litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vb0nK9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They have no evidence to support their attacks on Smartmatic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jeqp1J"&gt;“They have no evidence to support their attacks on Smartmatic because there is no evidence. This campaign was designed to defame Smartmatic and undermine legitimately conducted elections,” Antonio Mugica, Smartmatic CEO, said in a statement Monday. “This campaign is an attack on election systems and election workers in an effort to depress confidence in future elections and potentially counter the will of the voters, not just here, but in democracies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ErxY8"&gt;Over the last few weeks, Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems have been targeted by conspiracy theorists who allege that the companies manipulated votes in favor of Biden. Conspiracy theorists have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-dominion/fact-check-dominion-is-not-linked-to-smartmatic-antifa-or-venezuela-did-not-switch-u-s-2020-election-votes-in-virginia-and-was-not-subject-to-a-u-s-army-raid-in-germany-idUSKBN2861TB"&gt;falsely alleged&lt;/a&gt; that the voting companies have ties to antifa and Venezuela.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08TFG3"&gt;These conspiracy theories have traveled from the internet to state legislatures. Last week, Dominion Voting Systems called the allegations “defamatory,” saying company representatives would be made available &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/12/10/dominion-voting-systems-election-fraud-michigan-senate/3876804001/"&gt;to testify before the Michigan&lt;/a&gt; State Senate this week. Representatives had previously threatened to subpoena the voting company to testify as a result of these false election claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb7Kyn"&gt;Last month, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21563274/dhs-cisa-no-evidence-us-voting-compromised"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming that the November 3rd election was the “most secure in American history” and “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na9GXx"&gt;President Donald Trump has made baseless claims of voting fraud over the last few weeks. Shortly after CISA put out its statement debunking election fraud last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;Trump fired CISA director Chris Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, Krebs &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/08/944270554/former-cyber-security-chief-sues-trump-campaign-and-others-charging-defamation"&gt;filed defamation suits&lt;/a&gt; against the Trump campaign and Newsmax.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Aoki&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QP9i5D"&gt;If you’ve been showing up to work Zoom meetings in your pajamas and feel kind of weird about it, Japanese clothing retailer &lt;a href="https://www.aoki-style.com/shop/item/A28_20WHWMJK1?shopCode=AO-MENS"&gt;Aoki has a solution for you&lt;/a&gt;: a piece of clothing that looks like a classic suit jacket but &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like PJs. It’s calling it the Pajamas Suit, and it really does look like a suit jacket — complete with the cut and the buttons on both the sleeves and the front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcdZzX"&gt;This shirt, and others like it that aim to make you look more presentable in video calls, are uniquely suited (ha!) for 2020 when a lot of meetings have been happening remotely. While the standards for what counts as acceptable workwear &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/lead/casual-dress-in-workplace"&gt;have become more relaxed&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade or so, I think we’ve all shown up to Zoom calls in something we would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wear at the office. (I just did my last meeting in a T-shirt I’ve had since high school.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCcMiy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Japanese suit retailer Aoki is selling a “pajama suit,” a set of pajamas that look like a suit, perfect for work from home. &lt;a href="https://t.co/POZwBOpV7F"&gt;https://t.co/POZwBOpV7F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gearoid Reidy (@GearoidReidy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GearoidReidy/status/1338432287789043712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NnfXjF"&gt;While I like to think that clothing standards don’t affect me, and the idea of suits being the be all, end all of office attire is a little classist and a lot sexist, it still feels a bit weird to dress for work the same way I’d dress to go on a jog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcLwRX"&gt;That’s not to say I’m about to drop around $50 (4,990 yen) on the Pajamas Suit, though. Not that it doesn’t look great, because I think it does, but you still need to wear a T-shirt under it, and the available colors just don’t work with my current wardrobe. Oh, and it also seems like Aoki only ships to Japan, which makes sense since it’s a massive retailer in the country but doesn’t seem to have much of a presence outside of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSioP2"&gt;Thankfully, there’s an option for Americans: cardigans, which are essentially what the Pajamas Suit is. If you also want to attend your next Zoom meeting in comfort and style, you can probably find what you need in your local thrift shop. (Macklemore really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; ahead of his time.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is investigating data collection at YouTube, Facebook, and seven other companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VyPNBeJ6vZXDaU_MzhAPfofjmw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511777/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjpNkX"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday that it is launching a new inquiry into the privacy practices of some of the largest tech companies and social media platforms in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNNlYt"&gt;In a press release published Monday, the FTC announced that it is ordering nine social media and video streaming companies — including Amazon, TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, Discord, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube — to provide data on how they collect and use personal information provided by their users. The companies have 45 days to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i8VQx"&gt;Each of the nine companies was contacted for comment but did not immediately respond to requests from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gq6Xm"&gt;The FTC’s orders were authorized as part of a wide-ranging investigative inquiry and do not serve specific law enforcement purposes. However, the FTC could pursue enforcement actions should it find wrongful behavior throughout the study. In the agency’s Monday orders, the FTC requested that the companies provide information related to how they collect personal data, how that data determines which ads and content users are shown, and whether they “apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nul7Hu"&gt;The commission voted 4-1 to approve the orders with Commissioner Noah Phillips dissenting, saying that the probe was too wide-ranging to produce useful results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVKhwl"&gt;“These digital products may have launched with the simple goal of connecting people or fostering creativity. But, in the decades since, the industry model has shifted from supporting users’ activities to monetizing them,” three FTC commissioners who voted to approve the orders said in a joint statement Monday. “This transition has been fueled by the industry’s increasing intrusion into our private lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFJ99B"&gt;In February, the FTC used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2020/2/11/21133268/facebook-microsoft-apple-amazon-google-antitrust-review-joe-simons"&gt;this same investigative authority&lt;/a&gt; to request information on past acquisitions made by big tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. Last week, the FTC sued Facebook to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unwind its acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; of Instagram and WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.3 turns the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max into even better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QZTf4Wwz-AsxzbgiJBpQXh7JPM8=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511660/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0yKiG"&gt;If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max and consider yourself something of a photographer, the latest iOS update will help you get the most out of your phone’s cameras. That’s because it includes the new ProRAW feature that Apple first announced back at its October event. ProRAW combines the editing flexibility of RAW with Apple’s computational photography tricks like Smart HDR and Deep Fusion for the first time. You no longer have to choose between the flexibility of a standard RAW file and a JPEG or HEIC file that has all of Apple’s computational magic but limited potential for post-processing because ProRAW gives you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn29Fn"&gt;Shooting RAW photos on an iPhone is nothing new; for some time now, apps like Halide and Adobe Lightroom have let you capture all of the data the iPhone’s sensor can gather. And all of the usual benefits of RAW are here with ProRAW — vastly improved control over white balance is always the biggest factor for me — but it gives you greater leeway with adjusting exposure, sharpness, dynamic range, and more. You can make better adjustments to facial tone in a portrait or nail the exposure in a landscape shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHU4fB"&gt;But standard RAW images can look very grainy out of the iPhone since, well, these are still small smartphone camera sensors, and they’re without any computational photography optimization. Now, you should notice all the same detail as before but with less noise. That’s because ProRAW images do the same multiframe image processing as ordinary iPhone shots. Even with that, you get around 14 stops of dynamic range to work with in editing software. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnaQ11QShvs"&gt;This video from Josh Stunell on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of illustrating the differences between RAW and ProRAW:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3RPjZ"&gt;ProRAW can be used with all of the rear cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max — it’s not going to suddenly turn the ultrawide into a magic lens, but anything helps — and it also works in night mode. You can even access the depth mapping information captured by the sensor to make portrait mode-style adjustments after the fact, provided your editing app allows you to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXbqRsJXIdQky0lT_oSOdnY1foA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22022559/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can shoot ProRAW images with all three of the cameras on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1x51ON"&gt;How to use ProRAW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F4ih6B"&gt;To use ProRAW, first, you’ve got to enable it under the camera options in the settings menu. After that, you’ll see a “RAW” button appear at the upper-right of the camera viewfinder, which is how you can quickly toggle ProRAW on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLtObT"&gt;I should emphasize that while it’s easy to switch this on, you’re definitely not going to want to use ProRAW all the time. Files average around 25MB in size, which is dramatically larger than your everyday iPhone images. This is a feature best reserved for those very intentional photos with people you care about or at places that matter. ProRAW images appear in the camera roll like normal, but if you try to share them in apps like Instagram, you’ll get an error message. So you’ll want to export them as either a smaller JPEG or HEIC file first before sending them to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBt331"&gt;Another nice thing about ProRAW is since it uses Adobe’s widely supported DNG file format, there is already a plethora of apps that can open and edit the files without any update. But apps that use Apple’s own RAW converter will offer even more control since they’ll be able to access tone and distance mapping. Halide has already released an update to get the most out of ProRAW, and I’d expect others like Pixelmator, Darkroom, and Affinity Photo to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP2Oib"&gt;Apps that have their own RAW converter, namely Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and Capture One, can edit the DNG files today but won’t have all of the same capabilities as those that use Apple’s RAW converter. It’s possible Adobe and others will update their conversion tools in the future to make them work better with ProRAW. You can, of course, also just edit the images inside the Apple Photos app, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_l3ZTohF359m1aD2dhoBqv9yx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169707/IMG_0912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample ProRAW image edited in Darkroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBvhVB"&gt;If you want to share a ProRAW image, there are various ways to go about it depending on what you’re trying to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wDL3C4"&gt;If you want to transfer an Apple ProRAW to the computer: ensure the photo is unedited, then either AirDrop or plug the device into USB and use Image Capture or the Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sQEb3m"&gt;If you want to share an edited ProRAW photo:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;edit the photo in the Photos app, then AirDrop, email, or send via Messages. A JPG with the edits will be shared. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VP6iXO"&gt;If you want to email a ProRAW DNG to someone: open the Photos app first and use the share button to share via Mail. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ayEVZd"&gt;If you edit a ProRAW and want both the original DNG file and the edited JPG: use Image Capture or Windows Photos app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbkyu"&gt;If a ProRAW is edited but you want to transfer a DNG: duplicate the photo, then revert the edits (makes it an unedited file). A DNG can then be AirDropped, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ic83mC"&gt;If you used a third-party app that can take RAW+JPG, and you want both: use Image Capture to grab each file individually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="U7m9E1"&gt;I’ve been trying out ProRAW on my iPhone 12 Pro Max over the last few days, and I’m already appreciating the difference it can make. It’s just plain easier to get the most from a photo — retrieve highlights, boost shadows, fix the white balance, etc. — if you’re willing to put in the work of editing after the fact.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch expands its range of cardio fitness measurements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MZF_p6rHzWWg5qcqiTmTQIcUPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511554/apple_watch_series_6_dbohn_834.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8LbAqT"&gt;Apple is expanding the range of cardiorespiratory fitness that can be measured on the Apple Watch. Starting today, the Health app will classify users as having “high,” “above average,” “below average,” or “low” cardio fitness. Low levels will trigger a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxcYAI"&gt;The Watch tracks fitness through a metric called VO2 max, which is the amount of oxygen your body consumes during movement or exercise. The Apple Watch was already tracking average and high VO2 max for users during exercise. This update expands the range it measures and allows users to see their levels when they’re walking around, not just when they’re working out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38tz_1zBSHM870lZ1KB5AZTTpMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169614/Apple_iphone12_health_cardiofitness_high_12142020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find Cardio Fitness in the Health app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e16ONH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F12%2Fcardio-fitness-notifications-are-available-today-on-apple-watch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174552%2Fapple-watch-fitness-cardio-alerts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it tracks lower ranges of VO2 max by using Watch sensors like the heart rate monitor and accelerometer. Typically, VO2 max is calculated using specialized equipment in a lab while someone exercises on a treadmill or other piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHMICi"&gt;“Apple Watch now brings estimation of low cardio fitness levels from clinics directly to a user’s wrist, so people have more insight into how they can improve their long-term health through daily activity,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F12%2Fcardio-fitness-notifications-are-available-today-on-apple-watch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174552%2Fapple-watch-fitness-cardio-alerts#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5neNBn"&gt;Wearing a Watch is certainly less time-intensive than going into a lab, but it may not be as accurate. &lt;a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a20856601/can-your-watch-estimate-your-vo2-max/#:~:text=As%20the%20AHA%20statement%20noted,during%20a%2012%2Dminute%20run."&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing Garmin and Polar smartwatches to typical lab testing found that the watches tended to be off by about 5 percent. Apple does not report how well the Watch compares to traditional, clinical VO2 max measurement methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNNMSA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9ZsDM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83GKo4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KipPia1gaxnOLI5WAvLtRaxJMmM=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511532/Apple_fitnessplus_applewatch_iphone12_hiit_workout_12142020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ExdzK"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163126/apple-fitness-plus-launch-date-subscription-service-price"&gt;Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; service is officially out now, marking the launch of the company’s latest subscription service. Fitness Plus offers a variety of guided workouts (similar to competitors like Peloton) and costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1uP46"&gt;At launch, the service features workouts in 10 categories: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, treadmill (for both running and walking), rowing, and “mindful cooldown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is0lNI"&gt;To actually use Fitness Plus, you’ll need — at minimum — an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) running the just-released watchOS 7.2 update paired to an iPhone 6S (or newer) running the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22163752/ios-14-3-proraw-airpods-max-fitness-plus-available-now-download"&gt;also-just-released iOS 14.3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3613O"&gt;If you’re planning to use an iPad or Apple TV to view Fitness Plus videos, you’ll also need to have those devices updated to iOS 14.3 or tvOS 14.3, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pONw5l"&gt;Once you’ve updated your iPhone and Apple Watch, Fitness Plus can be accessed through a new tab in the Fitness app that’s preinstalled on your phone. iPad users will be able to download &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitness/id1208224953"&gt;the Fitness app from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;, while Apple TV users will automatically see the app installed once they’ve updated to tvOS 14.3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i1f3q"&gt;Existing Apple Watch owners can get a one-month free trial of Fitness Plus, while customers who buy an Apple Watch Series 3 (or newer) can get three months of free service. A single Fitness Plus subscription can be shared with up to six users through Apple’s Family Sharing service, and it’s also included in the Apple One Premier plan (which includes Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and 2TB of iCloud storage for $29.95 per month).&lt;/p&gt;
