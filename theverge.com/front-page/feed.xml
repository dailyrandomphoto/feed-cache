    <title>Microsoft says it took over servers being used by China-based hacking group Nickel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VgsNyO8iuHvwCoBKpsrC5GPYOWs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240731/acastro_200915_1777_hacking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WYAdRa"&gt;The Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has seized 42 websites that the China-based hacking group Nickel used to attack organizations in the US, as well as around the world, according to a report on &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/"&gt;Microsoft’s blog&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-seizes-sites-used-by-apt15-chinese-state-hackers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Microsoft says that the attacks were likely carried out to gather intelligence from government agencies, think tanks, and human rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1UAcS"&gt;A US District Court in Virginia gave Microsoft permission to take control of the comprised websites on December 2nd, as outlined in the court document (&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21138969-nickel_bc_order-granting-tro#document/p8/a2068724"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), allowing Microsoft to redirect traffic from those sites to Microsoft’s servers. While this won’t stop Nickel’s attacks completely, Microsoft says it should help “protect existing and future victims while learning more about Nickel’s activities.” You can view the full list of seized websites in this &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21138968-nickel_bc_appendix_a_domains"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7u942"&gt;Just after the DCU’s move to block Nickel, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/google-disrupts-russian-botnet-that-infected-1-million-windows-machines/"&gt;Google announced a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against two Russian individuals believed to be responsible for operating the Glupteba botnet. The botnet was reportedly used to infect one million Windows devices. Meanwhile, Google’s CyberCrime Investigation Group and Threat Analysis Group said they teamed up to delete “around 63M Google Docs observed to have distributed Glupteba, 1,183 Google Accounts, 908 Cloud Projects, and 870 Google Ads accounts associated with their distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fujQ0L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Nickel deploys malware designed to make changes at the deepest and most sensitive levels of the computer’s Windows operating system”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7lXqUF"&gt;In Microsoft’s initial complaint (&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21138967-nickel_bc_complaint"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), the company says that Nickel uses a “variety of techniques” to install malware on victims’ computers, including compromising third-party virtual private networks and spear phishing. Due to the nature of Nickel’s attacks, the group is able to exfiltrate sensitive information from the device unbeknownst to the user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHchkf"&gt;“During the infection of a victim’s computer, Nickel deploys malware designed to make changes at the deepest and most sensitive levels of the computer’s Windows operating system,” Microsoft’s complaint reads. “The consequences of these changes are that the user’s version of Windows is essentially adulterated, and unknown to the user, has been converted into a tool to steal credentials and sensitive information from the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9GGye"&gt;Microsoft says that it’s been tracking Nickel since 2016, noting that the group is also referred to as APT15, KE3CHANG, Vixen Panda, Royal APT, and Playful Dragon. Nickel has targeted diplomatic organizations and ministries of foreign affairs across the world, including countries in North America, South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa. It also reportedly strikes targets that align with China’s “geopolitical interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJizMR"&gt;With the 24 lawsuits that it has filed so far, Microsoft says that the DCU has shut down a total of over 10,000 compromised websites and blocked the registration of 600,000 potentially malicious sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxetoc"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583251/us-government-blames-china-cyberattacks-microsoft-exchange-hack"&gt;the US (along with several other nations) blamed the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;Microsoft Exchange attack&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;compromised the emails of over 30,000 organizations in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Google and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22642054/apple-amazon-google-microsoft-cybersecurity-billions"&gt;have since pledged&lt;/a&gt; to help the US government bolster its cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft is bringing NFT gear to Ghost Recon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AcSnIJd-WOQ0HiRzmtdYQAySHJI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240592/acastro_190528_1777_ubisoft_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pC9b5W"&gt;Ubisoft is officially getting into NFTs. On Tuesday, the company announced a new platform, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSVoJ0WUQfY"&gt;Ubisoft Quartz&lt;/a&gt;, where it will offer NFTs that it’s calling Digits. The Digits will be available first as in-game items like vehicles, weapons, and equipment in &lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt; in beta on Windows beginning later this week, &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/07/2347700/0/en/Introducing-Ubisoft-Quartz-The-First-Platform-for-Playable-and-Energy-Efficient-NFTs-In-AAA-Games.html"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dirQ4e"&gt;NFTs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;or non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt;, are unique digital goods that can be bought or sold with ownership tracked on the blockchain. NFTs are becoming an increasingly popular way to attempt to add value to digital goods, and that seems to be part of what Ubisoft is trying to do with Digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yehj4E"&gt;The company says that each Digit is unique, will track who has owned it over time, and will have its own serial number that can be seen in-game. Digits are only cosmetics, according to &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6as5XUADxpbBblHxFVhhzg"&gt;Ubisoft’s Baptiste Chardon&lt;/a&gt;, and “do not affect the gameplay in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pigTMD"&gt;NFTs have come under scrutiny for their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;effects on the environment&lt;/a&gt;, but Ubisoft is claiming Digits are energy-efficient because its Quartz Platform uses &lt;a href="https://tezos.com/carbon/"&gt;Tezos&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Flearn%2Fcrypto-basics%2Fwhat-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822410%2Fubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;proof-of-stake blockchain&lt;/a&gt; that requires less energy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ftOyXa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8uweqS"&gt;Ubisoft plans to release Digits “as part of limited Editions,” each will only offer a “fixed number” of items, and players can only own one of each Edition. That could create scarcity for the items, and Ubisoft says players will be able to resell Digits if they choose because Digits are stored on the blockchain. (Blockchain isn’t a requirement to be able to resell digital goods — Blizzard let people do it years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2013/5/8/4312100/diablo-iii-bug-leads-blizzard-to-pull-auction-house-offline-temporarily"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Diablo III’s&lt;/em&gt; Auction House&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wqmitd"&gt;Ubisoft is first offering three “drops” of free Digits on December 9th, December 12th, and December 15th. You can get them if you are playing &lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt; on Ubisoft Connect for Windows, have reached level 5, are at least 18 years old, and live in the US, Canada, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Australia or Brazil. More drops are planned for early 2022, Ubisoft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRILwm"&gt;Ubisoft recently signaled its interest in blockchain in its &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/ubisoft-is-planning-on-bringing-nfts-to-its-games-3084430"&gt;most recent earnings&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/20/animoca-brands-raises-65m-at-2-2b-valuation-from-ubisoft-and-others/"&gt;investing in Animoca Brands&lt;/a&gt;, a blockchain gaming company. It calls Digits a “large-scale experiment” in “Ubisoft’s four-year exploration of blockchain technology,” so this could be just the beginning of blockchain work from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQme3J"&gt;EA was &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ea-calls-nft-and-blockchain-games-the-future-of-our-industry/"&gt;also bullish&lt;/a&gt; on blockchain and NFTs in its latest earnings report, and Epic says it’s “open” to blockchain games on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729050/epic-game-store-open-to-blockchain-cryptocurrency-nft-games"&gt;the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt;. But not all gaming companies are on board; Valve has banned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;blockchain games and NFTs from Steam&lt;/a&gt;, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/xbox-exploitive-nft-gaming-projects-cb3d885f-694c-462d-bcb1-a24c892db32f.html"&gt;expressed concerns&lt;/a&gt; about NFTs being “exploitive.” And despite allowing blockchain games on the Epic Games Store, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said that Epic isn’t using crypto in its own games, meaning you probably shouldn’t expect to see NFT &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="quqnAz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIneYX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new thermostat is already on sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bg8zKtZg_nkoC1eJ52g1oDnOgaw=/0x147:1000x814/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240586/jtuohy_211115_4885_0009sq.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The lowest price ever on this smart thermostat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oz8rSO"&gt;Amazon’s new smart thermostat just received its first-ever price break. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Normally, this thermostat costs $59.99 but is currently on sale for $47.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the best price we’ve seen yet for this particular device, and considering it didn’t get a discount during Black Friday, this sale may not last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14ywLk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F1JXRZQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is also offering discounted bundles that combine the thermostat with a fourth-generation Echo Dot for $77.98 (normally $109.98)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F1RH8C5/?tag=aftvndeal-20&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another bundle that throws in a second-generation Echo Show 5 for $92.98 (normally $144.98)&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s worth noting that the two bundles being offered may not arrive until after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFOqQ2"&gt;The thermostat isn’t particularly fancy, but it was built in collaboration with the thermostat experts at Honeywell Home and enables you to control your home temperature through Alexa and a handy app that allows you to make adjustments while you’re away. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches"&gt;In our review,&lt;/a&gt; Jennifer Pattinson Tuohy spoke highly of the clean, modern design and was thoroughly impressed by the low-price point, although she found the app experience to be a bit lackluster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scuf’s Reflex for PS5 is a pricier, customizable take on the DualSense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Scuf Reflex controller for PS5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cSRzioh7lkTZslpM5SIUNbGwHTA=/0x0:7429x4953/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240424/reflexhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I adore the face buttons that don’t show the signature shape indicators.&lt;/em&gt; | Scuf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7pKWAh"&gt;Scuf has introduced the Reflex lineup of customizable wireless controllers made for the PS5 and PC, consisting of three pricey controllers. Pricing starts at $199.99 for the Reflex, $229.99 for the Reflex Pro, going all the way up to $259.99 for the Reflex FPS, and each model has its own unique features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKFp64"&gt;Across the range, the Reflex is built upon Sony’s first-party DualSense controller board. That means it’ll receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600654/sony-ps5-beta-software-2-0-update-controller-ps-app-parents"&gt;updates through your console&lt;/a&gt; and that its feature set is almost identical to what you’d get from Sony’s controller (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price"&gt;Scuf’s Instinct Pro for Xbox&lt;/a&gt; was built this way, too, mirroring Microsoft’s first-party controller). The Scuf Reflex is rechargeable and supports USB-C charging, and it has a mute button and features a touchpad — all features it shares in common with the DualSense. The Scuf Reflex and Reflex Pro (but not the Reflex FPS) feature haptics and Sony’s signature adaptive rear triggers, which can adjust the amount of tension you feel contextually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhgkGN"&gt;So, what does the $120 (or higher) premium for Scuf’s Reflex over the DualSense get you? It depends on which of the controllers you buy. All of them come bearing several differences that alter the DualSense’s aesthetic and functionality, for starters. The faceplate can be removed and swapped with a different one (more colors will come in “the weeks and months” following launch, but black is the only color available for now). You’ll also be able to purchase different colors of anti-friction rings that can be installed around the analog sticks that cushion their movement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The different colors of the Scuf Reflex" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unId5StdjZj7Zs_FQlK-eLBP3fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060633/reflexcolors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Scuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someday, all of these face plates will be available for purchase, though black is the only one coming at launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5DKBSo"&gt;All three models of the Scuf Reflex feature four rear paddles that can be customized. The controllers can store up to three profiles, letting you cycle between up to 12 unique paddle bindings, which is handy if you swap between game genres. In the box with each controller, you’ll get a few thumbsticks that can be replaced with the stock sticks: long, short, domed, and concave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASlDZj"&gt;Both the Reflex Pro and Reflex FPS have a “high-performance” grip around their back to make them easier to hold. The Reflex FPS is the only one of the bunch that features instant triggers, which are Scuf’s feature that, upon toggling some switches on the rear of the controller, significantly shortens the pull action. This feature (also present on the Xbox-specific Instinct Pro) makes triggers feel more like bouncy mouse clicks, and that shorter pull could lead to faster actuation to let you get the jump on your opponents. As mentioned before, the Reflex FPS lacks haptics and adaptive triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPRwLr"&gt;I’ve yet to actually get my hands on any of the Reflex controllers, but I’m excited that there’s finally a third-party wireless alternative to Sony’s DualSense coming to market. Though, it’s tough to call it an alternative when it costs so much more. But if you’re in the crowd of people who wish Sony would bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571413/sony-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment-ps4-ps5-controller-playstation"&gt;its affordable Back Button Attachment from the PS4 days&lt;/a&gt; to the PS5, well, this might be your only solution for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is taking its self-driving company Mobileye public in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O2Q6tu2a_cvJkqitbNb99cENDiI=/129x0:1520x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240232/mobileye_av_nyc_intel_24.jpg.rendition.intel.web.1648.927.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDS4Ms"&gt;Intel announced that it will take public its self-driving technology company Mobileye, the Israeli company it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/13/14906304/intel-mobileye-acquisition-self-driving-cars"&gt;acquired for $15.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. The chipmaker said that by listing Mobileye’s shares on the stock market, it hopes to unlock more value for Intel’s shareholders. Intel will remain the majority shareholder in Mobileye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ualCdf"&gt;In a statement, Intel heralded its acquisition of the company as a noteworthy success, noting that Mobileye’s revenue in 2021 was 40 percent higher than the previous year. An IPO “provides the best opportunity to build on Mobileye’s track record for innovation and unlock value for shareholders,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urJIrV"&gt;The news comes as a number of electric and autonomous vehicle companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763180/aurora-av-spac-merger-nasdaq-publicly-traded-urmson"&gt;have gone public in recent months&lt;/a&gt;, with varying levels of success. Despite this wave of interest in the public markets, the AV industry has struggled with overinflated expectations, missed deadlines, shuttered businesses, and a host of technological challenges. Still, many companies have said they are on the cusp of launching commercial businesses after years of testing and research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxejIR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Founded in Jerusalem in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W3LXln"&gt;Founded in Jerusalem in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram, the company develops systems and chips to help vehicles navigate autonomously and provide warnings for collisions. Tesla originally used Mobileye chips for its Autopilot system but &lt;a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/7/26/12285930/tesla-mobileye-self-driving-cars"&gt;severed ties with the company after a fatal accident&lt;/a&gt; where Tesla claims Mobileye’s technology was unable to distinguish between a laterally crossing truck and the sky behind it. Its EyeQ4 chip is currently used in the NIO ES6 and ES8, Nissan’s ProPilot 2.0, VW’s Travel Assistant in the Passat and Golf, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, as well as the F-150 truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4cBph"&gt;Mobileye is currently working on four different products that offer varying levels of automation, including an advanced driver assist system (ADAS) that it currently supplies to 25 companies and a “premium” ADAS that will launch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346358/geely-electric-vehicle-brand-zeekr-china"&gt;Zeekr&lt;/a&gt;, an electric vehicle brand owned by China’s Geely. Neither ADAS system will include lidar, the sensor that uses lasers to determine the real-time location of objects on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrqrSi"&gt;Mobileye’s other two products will use lidar and are more advanced in their automation technology. Mobileye Drive is a self-driving system that utilizes the companies’ EyeQ system-on-a-chip, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map. This product will be used by customers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.transdev.com/en/press-release/mobileye-transdev-ats-lohr-autonomous-shuttles/"&gt;Transdev, Lohr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/schaeffler-and-mobileye-to-industrialize-self-driving-shuttles/"&gt;Schaeffler&lt;/a&gt; for applications like autonomous delivery vehicles and self-driving shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCPwGB"&gt;Mobileye also aspires to operate its own robotaxis, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22659366/intel-mobileye-robotaxi-germany-sixt-moovit"&gt;recently announcing&lt;/a&gt; plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in Germany in 2022. It also said it will&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt; test its vehicles in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, a notoriously dense and difficult place to test AVs, but is still negotiating with local regulators for permission. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jessica Rosenworcel confirmed by Senate to lead the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Hearing On FCC Oversight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVfAq_9vu0lwp_erEB_n8PydtTk=/0x0:4574x3049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240230/1222449901.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lee0ZP"&gt;On Tuesday, the Senate voted 68 to 31 to confirm Jessica Rosenworcel’s re-appointment to the Federal Communications Commission, putting her in place to be the first permanent chair of the agency under President Biden. Rosenworcel will also be the first female chair &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/commissioners-1934-present"&gt;in the 86-year history of the FCC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkpSLy"&gt;The vote officially confirmed Rosenworcel’s reappointment as FCC commissioner, but with Senate approval in place, it makes her formal ascension to chair all but certain. In a speech announcing the floor vote, Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called Rosenworcel “a remarkable, highly experienced and historic nominee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIvPY3"&gt;“It’s the honor of my lifetime to lead the @FCC and serve as the first permanent female Chair,” said Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcelFCC/status/1468271741315207177"&gt;in a tweet after the vote&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s work to do to make sure modern communications reach everyone, everywhere. Now let’s get to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFhiPk"&gt;As chair, Rosenworcel is expected to place a particular emphasis on broadband access, working to expand high-speed internet coverage in underserved areas. In a Vergecast interview in 2020, she placed particular emphasis on the “homework gap” caused as schools move online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="78oUEf"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP8019458570" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xiRdjs"&gt;“We need a nationwide plan for addressing the digital divide,” Rosenworcel said at the time. “As a nation, we need a policy that addresses how we’re going to connect all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1YXrR"&gt;Rosenworcel will be taking the reins amid an extended deadlock at the commission, which has been without a fifth commissioner — and as a result, without a Democratic majority — since President Biden took office. As a result, the FCC has been unable to take action on net neutrality, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321995/net-neutrality-ed-markey-save-the-internet-open-ajit-pai-rosenworcel"&gt;widely anticipated in the wake of the election&lt;/a&gt;. In October, Biden nominated longtime net neutrality advocate Gigi Sohn for the fifth seat, but she has generated significant opposition from Republicans and may not receive a full Senate vote until after the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8uJCJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included Rosenworcel statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Amazon server outage is causing problems for Alexa, Ring, Disney Plus, and others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Amazon Web Services logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVu4i0c_YWVLUdA-WvFOOWrbvps=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240006/1230840274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxliB"&gt;Problems with some Amazon Web Services cloud servers are causing slow loading or failures for significant chunks of the internet. Amazon’s widespread network of data centers powers many of the things you interact with online, including this website, so as we’ve seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble"&gt;outage incidents&lt;/a&gt;, any problem has massive rippling effects. People started noticing problems at around 10:45AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yicS6U"&gt;There are reports of outages for Disney Plus streaming and games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG, League of Legends,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Valorant.&lt;/em&gt; We’ve also noticed some problems accessing &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and other Amazon products like the Alexa AI assistant, Kindle ebooks, Amazon Music, Chime, or Ring security cameras. The &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; list of services with spikes in their outage reports runs off nearly any recognizable name: Tinder, Roku, Coinbase, both Cash App and Venmo, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERNiN"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29473630"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rb226w/aws_outage/"&gt;network admins&lt;/a&gt; everywhere about errors connecting to Amazon’s instances and the AWS Management Console that controls their access to the servers. Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;official status page&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with messages confirming the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1dmcwH"&gt;8:49 AM PST We are experiencing elevated error rates for EC2 APIs in the US-EAST-1 region. We have identified root cause and we are actively working towards recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2wNqI"&gt;We are experiencing API and console issues in the US-EAST-1 Region. We have identified root cause and we are actively working towards recovery. This issue is affecting the global console landing page, which is also hosted in US-EAST-1. Customers may be able to access region-specific consoles going to https://console.aws.amazon.com/. So, to access the US-WEST-2 console, try https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xyKq2j"&gt;It appears that the problems are focused on the US-EAST-1 AWS region hosted in Virginia, so users elsewhere may not see as many issues, and even if you’re affected, it could manifest as slightly slower loading while the network reroutes your requests somewhere else. Contacted for comment, Amazon pointed to the updates on its status page, which indicate the company is “actively working towards recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqa8R3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional information about outage and Amazon’s current status.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer made a $60 RGB cooling fan with MagSafe for your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksPr8klWvsl6hkeKkUprWCzacuI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240061/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h7e_h83_9276684894238_211207_Phone_Cooler_Chroma_MagSafe_Compatible_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2r578u"&gt;Razer has announced its latest smartphone accessory: &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-accessories%2Frazer-phone-cooler-chroma&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Razer Phone Cooler Chroma&lt;/a&gt;, an RGB-light infused cooling fan for your iPhone or Android device that’s designed to help cool down your phone during intense gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeTtcV"&gt;The Cooler Chroma fan &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-accessories%2Frazer-phone-cooler-chroma%2FRC21-01790100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comes in two versions&lt;/a&gt;, both of which cost $59.99: a magnetic model that’s compatible with Apple’s MagSafe accessory system that snaps right onto the back of your iPhone, and a model with a “universal clamp” for Android devices or iPhones without MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFBbEOQ51D-ev0AiVj0ct1kVGOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070214/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_11.38.54_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IB7Fiq"&gt;Despite its mobile-focused design, the Cooler Chroma fan doesn’t seem to have a built-in battery, meaning that you’ll need to plug it into a USB-C power source when you want to use it (which will likely limit how useful it’ll actually be for gaming on the go). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6I4D"&gt;As for the actual cooling properties of the Cooler Chroma, Razer notes that it features a seven-blade fan that spins at up to 6400 RPM, a thermoelectric cooler, and an aluminum heat sink to siphon off excess heat from your phone. There are also 12 customizable RGB lights, of course, because it’s a gaming accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEJHya"&gt;The Razer Phone Cooler Chroma is available now from Razer’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap’s first AR Spectacles are an ambitious, impractical start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQtRUhKra793wcYWABL9kXZcCG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239915/alopez_211129_4909_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Mainstream AR glasses are still years away&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YcwMIw"&gt;It doesn’t take long to realize why Snap’s first true AR glasses aren’t for sale. The overall design is the highest quality of any standalone AR eyewear I’ve tried, and they make it easy to quickly jump into a variety of augmented-reality experiences, from a multiplayer game to a virtual art installation. But the first pair I was handed during a recent demo overheated after about 10 minutes, and the displays are so small that I wouldn’t want to look through them for a long period of time, even if the battery allowed for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wiTww"&gt;Snap is aware of the limitations. Instead of releasing these glasses publicly, it’s treating this generation of Spectacles like a private beta. The company has given out pairs to hundreds of its AR creators since the glasses were announced in May and has recently made a few notable software updates based on user feedback. “It was really just about getting the technology out there in the hands of actual people and doing it in a way that would allow us to maximize our learning from their experiences of using it,” Bobby Murphy, Snap’s co-founder and chief technology officer, says of the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqVNla"&gt;After months of asking for a demo, Snap invited me and a handful of other journalists to try them in conjunction with &lt;a href="https://lensfest.live"&gt;Lens Fest&lt;/a&gt;, Snap’s annual AR creator conference being held virtually this week. Guided by Snap employees in a Los Angeles backyard, I tried a wide range of AR experiences in the glasses, including a zombie chase, a pong game, Solar System projection, and an interactive art piece that utilized basic hand tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01TWQx"&gt;The demoes showed me that Snap has an ambitious, long-term vision for where AR is headed. The hardware also highlighted the technical limitations keeping mainstream AR glasses at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83FHfR29GHhitbtjuiuE4hllPYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060788/alopez_211129_4909_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxihI6"&gt;Like past versions, these AR Spectacles boast a bold design. The narrow, sharp-edged frame has a similar aesthetic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt;, something that is not lost on Snap’s product designers, and they come with a sturdy, magnetized case that can be turned into a charging stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Six0Pe"&gt;The glasses are light to wear, with flexible sides that can bend out from the head enough to accommodate prescription glasses underneath. (Prescription lenses are available to AR creators &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/creatorform"&gt;who apply&lt;/a&gt; and receive a pair.) They include stereo speakers, onboard Wi-Fi, a USB-C port for charging, and two front-facing cameras for capturing video and detecting surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQqYEW"&gt;The biggest limitation I noticed was the battery, which lasts for only 30 minutes of use. Snap did not try to hide this fact and had multiple pairs ready on standby to swap out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFw1vpoveC3rzomUOvIuSdRum7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060786/alopez_211129_4909_0015.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHQVuc"&gt;The AR effects, which Snap calls Lenses, are projected by a pair of dual waveguide displays that sync with Snapchat on a paired mobile phone. Besides the battery, the main drawback to these Spectacles is the small size of the displays, which covers roughly half of the physical lenses. Due to the small field of view, the AR effects I tried looked better after the fact in their full size on a phone screen, rather than in the actual glasses. Even still, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides"&gt;WaveOptics waveguides&lt;/a&gt; were surprisingly rich in color and clarity. The displays’ 2,000 nits of brightness means they are clearly visible in sunlight, a tradeoff that severely impacts battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H9p16"&gt;Since Snap announced these Spectacles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, it has added some new software improvements. To maximize battery life, an endurance mode automatically turns off the displays when an AR Lens, such as a scavenger hunt game, is running but not actively being used. Lenses can be tailored to specific locations based on a GPS radius. A feature coming soon called Custom Landmarkers will let people overlay Lenses onto local landmarks persistently for others wearing Spectacles to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j1L82"&gt;Another new software update brings Connected Lenses to Spectacles, letting multiple pairs interact with the same Lens when sharing a Wi-Fi network. I tried a couple of basic multiplayer games with a Snap AR creator named Aidan Wolf, including one he made that lets you shoot orbs of energy at your opponent with the capture button on the side of the frame. The pairing system still needs work since syncing our glasses to play the game took a couple of tries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEnf5reRxNrtBc5ODWV-bLrCTFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060793/alopez_211129_4909_0022.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcGVAv"&gt;None of the Lenses I tried blew me away. But a few showed me the promise of how compelling AR glasses will be once the hardware is more advanced. Rudimentary hand tracking was limited to one Lens I tried that let me cue different parts of a moving art piece with specific gestures. Assuming hand tracking gets better over time, I can see it being a key way to control the glasses. In one of the other more impressive experiences, I placed persistent location markers around the backyard and then raced through them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YzMbm"&gt;Most of the Lenses I tried felt like the basic proofs of concept I’ve seen in other AR headsets over the years and not experiences that would compel me to buy these glasses if they were available for purchase. But for glasses that have been in the wild for less than a year, it’s clear that creators will dream up interesting Lenses as the software and future hardware gets better. I’ve seen a few early concepts online that are compelling, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dmvrg/status/1450297362551824384"&gt;exercise games&lt;/a&gt;, utility use cases like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/V_Kurbatov/status/1465311637771071490"&gt;seeing the city you’re in while traveling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP8fTgs8-08"&gt;AR food menus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpERRE"&gt;Here are a few Lenses I captured during my demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="gpfaMJ"&gt;

&lt;p id="Qd4Grl"&gt;The glasses’ main visual interface is called the Lens Carousel. A touchpad on the side of the frame uses flick gestures to navigate in and out of Lenses, view recorded footage, and send it to Snapchat friends without removing the glasses. You can also use your voice to cue a Lens. Ways of controlling future Spectacles will likely include eye-tracking and more robust hand tracking — technologies Snap is already exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ODS4kw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We fully understand that this is still a number of years away”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvbesa"&gt;A dedicated button on the side of the Spectacles frame is for Scan, Snap’s visual search feature that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search"&gt;recently introduced in the main Snapchat app&lt;/a&gt;. I used it to scan a plant on a table and my glasses recommended a few plant-related Lenses to try. Like Scan in Snapchat, its functionality and ability to recognize objects is fairly limited for now. But if it continues to get better, I could see Scan being a staple feature for Spectacles in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVLN7G"&gt;Meanwhile, the tech powering Lenses is continuing to get more advanced. At Lens Fest this week, Snap is announcing a slew of new tools for making Lenses smarter, including a library of music from the top music labels and the ability to pull in real-time information from outside partners like the crypto trading platform FTX, Accuweather, and iTranslate. A new real-world physics engine and software Snap calls World Mesh makes Lenses interact more naturally with the world by moving with the laws of gravity, reacting to real surfaces, and understanding the depth of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XOgjLV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10906155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AotPEx"&gt;Like Meta, Snap sees AR glasses as the future of computing. “We’ve been very interested in and invested in AR for a number of years now because we view AR as the capacity to perceive the world and render digital experiences in much the same way that we naturally observe and engage with our surroundings as people,” Bobby Murphy tells me. “And I think this is really in stark contrast to the way that we use a lot of technology today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G1l3Ph"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An “insane distribution system of augmented reality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOGtFs"&gt;Murphy won’t say when AR Spectacles will be ready to sell publicly, but Meta and other tech companies have signaled that consumer-ready AR eyewear isn’t coming any time soon. “We fully understand that this is still a number of years away,” Murphy says, citing battery and display technology as the two key limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUaMWU"&gt;While the tech to make quality AR glasses a reality is still being developed, Snap is already betting its future on AR in the mobile phone era. According to Murphy, Snap’s “main priority now as a company is to really support and empower our partners and our community to be as successful as they can be through AR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjKGv4k-xECwSoT4ztDhlL2Wubg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060789/alopez_211129_4909_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5h7XG"&gt;Snap claims to have over 250,000 Lens Creators who have collectively made 2.5 million Lenses that have been viewed a staggering 3.5 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt; times. 300 creators have a made a Lens that's been viewed over one billion times. “We’re building this really insane distribution system of augmented reality that doesn’t exist anywhere else,” says Sophia Dominguez, Snap’s head of AR platform partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYrJcI"&gt;Now the company is starting to focus on ways to help Lens Creators make money, including a new marketplace that lets app developers using Snap’s camera technology pay creators directly to use their Lenses. Viewers of a Lens can send its creator an in-app gift, which they can then redeem for real money. And for the first time, a Lens can include a link to a website, allowing a creator to link to something like an online store directly from AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVsnbW"&gt;What about letting users pay for Lenses directly? “It’s something we’ve certainly given thought to,” says Murphy. He calls NFTs a “very, very fascinating space” and “a good example of digital assets [and] digital art having a kind of a real, tangible value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LTglDu"&gt;Snap doesn’t like to talk about its future product roadmap but Murphy is clear that “new updates to our hardware roadmap” will keep coming “fairly often.” In the meantime, it’s making an effort to court AR creators long before its glasses are ready for primetime. While there’s no guarantee that Snap will be a major player when the tech is finally ready, for now it has a head start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xp4Z2n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie celebrates its 30th Anniversary in Destiny 2 with off-brand Halo gear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwG-w7IB3RcrvNu27kCUwUNQtks=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239813/2021_30th_Press_Kit_Large_Gear_08.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obF5tQ"&gt;A lot is happening in the world of &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; today. Bungie is celebrating its 30th Anniversary inside &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, with a big content drop that includes &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-like guns. A trailer for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s new Bungie 30th Anniversary pack shows off a Magnum-like sidearm in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, alongside a Battle Rifle-like pulse rifle in the looter shooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg6sym"&gt;Both guns appear to look and feel like the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; weapons, but there’s no mention of an official crossover with Microsoft anywhere. It doesn’t appear that Bungie secured the official rights from Microsoft to put the actual &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; guns it originally created in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and has instead done a good job at producing replicas that nod to the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FgiAih"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bungie just revealed a Halo-like Battle Rifle and Magnum are coming to Destiny 2 today, to celebrate 30 years of Bungie   &lt;a href="https://t.co/xkSUwpTtPZ"&gt;https://t.co/xkSUwpTtPZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fdaR7yrMr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4fdaR7yrMr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1468236173646737422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vBg9Hi"&gt;“Reunite with an Exotic Sidearm that you may recognize from adventures long ago,” reads a &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Direct/Anniversary?ciid=50638"&gt;description on Bungie’s website&lt;/a&gt; for the Magnum-like gun. “It led you to glory then and it will do so again.” The exotic sidearm is called Forerunner, and the Battle Rifle-like weapon is named BxR-55 Battler. There’s even armor for the Titan that includes a Needler-style shoulder pad, and armor for the warlock that features the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ring. The &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-like loot doesn’t even require Destiny 2 players to own the 30th Anniversary pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw7o5K"&gt;The 30th Anniversary pack also includes a new six-person activity (which is separately free to all players) with armor and weapons, the grasp of avarice dungeon, and the return of the infamous Gjallarhorn rocket launcher. Bungie is also bringing back classic weapons like the Matador 64, Eyasluna, and 1000-Yard Stare, which can be earned with the 30th Anniversary pack, alongside some heavy changes to the player-vs-player sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft7wsW"&gt;If that’s not enough nostalgia for Bungie’s classic games, there’s even a Myth Claymore (&lt;em&gt;Myth&lt;/em&gt;) and Marathon (&lt;em&gt;Marathon&lt;/em&gt;) armor ornament set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzSPQS4eRkj5kih3ZSHBeGyJwcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070058/2021_30th_Press_Kit_Large_Gear_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2’s new exotic sidearm looks like Halo’s Magnum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXo07d4JaHVAPuQQ5GjJkDMJO2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070108/2021_30th_Press_Kit_Large_NPC_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new space horse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcUpoZ"&gt;There’s even a space horse, an NPC that will be housed inside the giant loot cave where players will earn some of today’s new weapons and armor. The mystical space horse was first spotted in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;during Season of the Drifter, and it has some links to the Nine, a mysterious faction inside &lt;em&gt;Destiny’s &lt;/em&gt;universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw5DAq"&gt;Combined with some great-looking armor, cosmetics, and ornaments, it feels like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;is getting a big injection of content midway through a season that leads to the next big expansion: &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;. The game’s biggest expansion in years, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639582/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-expansion-release-date-gjallarhorn"&gt;will launch on February 22nd&lt;/a&gt;. It will see players finally face Savathûn, and continue the story of the sci-fi space series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bk9co"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; expansion will also feature a new location, Savathûn’s Throne World, alongside important changes to existing subclasses, campaign content, weapons, armor, and a new raid. The 30th Anniversary pack should hopefully hold players over until February, in what’s an unusually long season for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
