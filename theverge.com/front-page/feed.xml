    <title>Facebook reportedly plans newsletter tools after explosion in popularity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IXXL_7-6WkblSIbXTh4vxzPu_OM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738832/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bXjWLC"&gt;Facebook is planning to offer newsletter tools for independent journalists and writers, &lt;a href="https://nyti.ms/36hBCTB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. These are thought to include features for helping writers build a following using the social network, curate their email lists, and manage their paid subscriptions. Although work on the project is in its early stages, executives reportedly hope the features could launch as soon as this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QhuRK"&gt;The news comes as interest in newsletters is booming. Newsletter service Substack boasted over 250,000 paying subscribers across its service &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html"&gt;as of September last year&lt;/a&gt;, and just this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter acquired newsletter rival Revue&lt;/a&gt;. A number of high-profile journalists have left traditional publications to start up independent newsletters, lured by the promise of complete editorial control over their work and the ability to profit more directly from the subscription revenue it brings in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MqLIOF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to do more to support the independent journalists and experts who are building businesses and audiences online”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMKZI6"&gt;Facebook has been attempting to better highlight news sources on its platform. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;News Tab&lt;/a&gt; is a section of the service featuring content from partnering media organizations, some of which are paid for the inclusion of their articles. While the News Tab has seen Facebook improve its relationship with traditional publishers, the newsletter tools are thought to be an attempt to court individual writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pKaXI"&gt;In a statement given to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Facebook didn’t directly confirm the report, but said the company is working on ways to support independent journalists. “We want to do more to support the independent journalists and experts who are building businesses and audiences online,” Facebook’s vice president for global news partnerships Campbell Brown said. “We’re exploring ways to help them benefit from the news products we’ve built, like Facebook News and subscriptions, while also building new tools to complement what journalists already find useful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2AxE"&gt;Given the explosion in the popularity of newsletters, it was only a matter of time before Facebook started exploring the area. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told his team to make the project a priority after noticing the trend. But jumping onto the bandwagon is unlikely to go down well with Facebook’s critics. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1355044530278567938"&gt;Kara Swisher put it in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Does Facebook have one fresh idea or do they need to swipe them all?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCsYw1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal adds mainstream chat features to lure wider audience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Signal logo seen in the background of a silhouette hand holding a mobile phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcEQ4AyHaakar8q2gQvAHxBEqrU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738816/1230608869.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DouYvU"&gt;The latest version of Signal for both iOS (5.3.1) and Android (5.3.7) brings a number of new additions to the increasingly popular encrypted messaging app. These include mainstream features like chat wallpapers, animated stickers, and an “About” section in your profile. The iOS app now handles data more efficiently, too, bringing it closer to feature parity with the Android app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTogdR"&gt;Messaging apps like Signal and Telegram have seen a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;surge in growth&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks. Signal was helped by a recommendation from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, while both benefited from the backlash to Facebook’s confusing new privacy policy for WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYCe93"&gt;The new features were first announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242"&gt;on January 11th&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; reported on them rolling out in the beta version of Signal for Android &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/22/signal-starts-catching-up-to-whatsapp-by-adding-custom-wallpapers-and-animated-stickers-apk-download/"&gt;last week Friday&lt;/a&gt;. With chat wallpapers, you can pick from a number of presets or select a photo of your own, and you can also set a wallpaper for a specific conversation or all of them. The beta had 24 animated stickers, according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRqVo1"&gt;The iOS app, meanwhile, is also more efficient with data. iPhone users will see a new setting to lower data usage during calls, an option to automatically pause attachment downloads during calls, and improved image compression among other enhancements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eqbi3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a sneak peek at some new Signal features that will start rolling out in a few days:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Chat wallpapers!&lt;br&gt;• About field for your Signal profile&lt;br&gt;• Animated stickers&lt;br&gt;• For iOS: Media auto-download settings and full-screen profile photos (to match Android)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good morning   ! &lt;a href="https://t.co/KEAbhMswRI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/KEAbhMswRI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Signal (@signalapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1348785240819466242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mlkElX"&gt;Signal has long been a popular messaging option for those focused on the security of their communications — the European Commission told staff to switch to Signal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21150918/european-commission-signal-encrypted-messaging"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, for example — and Signal is still focused on releasing new security-focused features, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175923/signal-video-calls-new-groups-five-people-max"&gt;encrypted group video calls&lt;/a&gt;. But more consumer-focused features like wallpapers and stickers could make Signal feel more approachable for users coming to the app from WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, and, ideally, keep them on Signal over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi says its ‘Air Charge’ technology works over several meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-sAPh7Ly0LkMErzbgevFocGK60=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68738358/Lark20210129_110714.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RArVhf"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/01/29/forget-about-cables-and-charging-stands-with-revolutionary-mi-air-charge-technology/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; “Mi Air Charge Technology,” a wireless charging system that the company claims is able to charge devices “within a radius of several meters.” Multiple devices can be charged at 5W at the same time, according to Xiaomi, and physical obstacles apparently don’t reduce charging efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX2fpH"&gt;Xiaomi says the technology will also work with smartwatches and fitness bracelets. Another goal is to make “living rooms truly wireless,” with speakers, lamps, and smart home devices all being powered by the same remote system. A Xiaomi representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, however, that no commercial products will include the technology this year, and declined to provide a timeframe for release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzrwjL"&gt;Here’s how Mi Air Charge Technology works, in Xiaomi’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J40LtW"&gt;The core technology of Xiaomi’s remote charging lies in space positioning and energy transmission. Xiaomi’s self-developed isolated charging pile has five phase interference antennas built in, which can accurately detect the location of the smartphone. A phase control array composed of 144 antennas transmits millimeter-wide waves directly to the phone through beamforming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDIHy0"&gt;On the smartphone side, Xiaomi has also developed a miniaturized antenna array with built-in “beacon antenna” and “receiving antenna array”. Beacon antenna broadcasts position information with low power consumption. The receiving antenna array composed of 14 antennas converts the millimeter wave signal emitted by the charging pile into electric energy through the rectifier circuit, to turn the sci-fi charging experience into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4vsiv"&gt;Needless to say, you should be skeptical about the prospects of this technology making it to market until evidence suggests otherwise. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14124938/energous-truly-wireless-charging-apple-ces-2017"&gt;Companies like Energous&lt;/a&gt; have been making announcements about “truly wireless charging” at CES and beyond for several years, but the technology is yet to gain serious traction. Xiaomi has demonstrated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;wireless charging engineering breakthroughs&lt;/a&gt; in the past, however, and has the advantage of owning a huge hardware ecosystem that it could theoretically leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to Twitter, Jon Stewart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jon Stewart anti social network" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9s9-6K0bIJs8vewnvuJ7SqBP6Wo=/0x19:400x286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737853/jon-stewart.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V8kEiG"&gt;Jon Stewart has just joined Twitter, and is now the proud owner of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/"&gt;a verified account&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, his first tweet was about the redditors on r/WallStreetBets and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;their stonks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqdUdU"&gt;While it may be the first time he’s made an appearance on Twitter, Stewart is already fitting right in — with a profile picture that’s not actually of him, but a dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9WFixW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is bullshit. The Redditors aren't cheating, they're joining a party Wall Street insiders have been enjoying for years. Don't shut them down...maybe sue them for copyright infringement instead!!&lt;br&gt;We've learned nothing from 2008.&lt;br&gt;Love&lt;br&gt;StewBeef&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jon_actual) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354901018564321287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2cPCyg"&gt;Fellow late-night commentator Stephen Colbert jumped in to welcome him to the platform, giving Stewart a quote tweet hours before his account was verified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f2SXmg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Well, one thing changed since 2008- a friend of mine joined Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/XowK9xXu4D"&gt;https://t.co/XowK9xXu4D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/1354911389379391489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hCQOWW"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354967777166172163"&gt;second tweet&lt;/a&gt;, Stewart thanked everyone for the warm welcome, but says he only plans to use Twitter in a “sporadic and ineffective manner.” (Opposed to the rest of us, who use it constantly and ineffectively.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uRxqD2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks for the warm welcome! I promise to only use this app in a sporadic and ineffective manner.&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jon_actual) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jon_actual/status/1354967777166172163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M0sTzL"&gt;It’s unclear what the future holds for Stewart on Twitter. Will he use it to promote his upcoming return to television &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;with his Apple TV show&lt;/a&gt;? Will he actually say the word “stonks”? Whatever his plan is, it’ll be seen by a large audience — he’s racked up more than 120,000 followers in the nearly five hours since he first tweeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al0XQV"&gt;From all of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIGC3CfFxY4"&gt;welcome to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood denies claims that it sold GameStop shares out from under its traders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trading Platform Robinhood Fined 65 Million By Securities And Exchange Commission" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgnDztU3yGNrIps2Pu1iFIGpg7I=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737774/1291817081.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HrSPad"&gt;No, Robinhood tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t sell off full shares of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop, AMC, and other buzzy stocks&lt;/a&gt; without permission from its traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9qz0P"&gt;That contradicts the stories of twelve people who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;saying that the app unexpectedly sold off their holdings in some of these companies. Quite a number of Robinhood users expressed their surprise on social media today that the app was selling off their stakes, and we tracked down a dozen of them. These traders didn’t believe they had prompted the sales, and they said they weren’t aware of anything on their account that would have automatically triggered them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZTzgT"&gt;“I didn’t have any triggers to sell the stock whether it went up or down. I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500,” Jett Flores, who said he was holding stock in GameStop and AMC through Robinhood, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oPcjb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The small traders planned to hold onto their stock, rather than sell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IoLdvA"&gt;A spokesperson for Robinhood said these small sellers are wrong about how their shares were sold. “I can confirm that claims that Robinhood proactively sold customers’ shares outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures are false,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laWYcl"&gt;On Wednesday, Robinhood warned some investors with options in GameStop and AMC that it may automatically sell off their stakes to reduce risk, the spokesperson said. But these investors told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they didn’t have options in GameStop or AMC and hadn’t purchased the stocks on margin. They had purchased the shares outright, they said, and were planning to hold onto them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kr6KcG"&gt;Margin orders occur when an investor borrows money from the broker (in this case Robinhood) to complete a sale, and brokers can call in those shares if they’re worried the investor can’t pay up. According to Robinhood, most of its actions have been calling in options to purchase shares — a more aggressive move, but not unprecedented. But if users fully owned their shares, as these traders claim they did, selling the holdings would be far more unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0bJ13"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;saw screenshots from six traders indicating that their purchase of GameStop or AMC stock had been filled within Robinhood. Six traders sent screenshots showing that their stock in these companies had been sold, with four clearly indicating that they had been sold today. Another trader sent screenshots showing a purchase of Naked Brand stock being filled and then sold within the app. The screenshots don’t indicate how the purchases were funded or how the sales were initiated, but in several of them the app displays a message saying, “We’ve received your order to sell [#] shares of [stock] at the best available price.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qykRDd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1AHtZ"&gt;Traders who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said they were disappointed to lose their stake in these companies. The traders had been planning to keep the stock for longer, and several said they certainly wouldn’t have sold it at the point that they believe Robinhood pushed through the transaction, as GameStop’s stock was faltering from a nearly $500 high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Mp7Fl"&gt;“It’s extremely dishonest trade on their part and unacceptable,” Ian Q., who said Robinhood unexpectedly sold his shares in GameStop this morning, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2J8hJ"&gt;The surprise selloff isn’t happening to everyone — plenty of people on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (and one person I know, who told me they purchased GameStop stock days ago) say they weren’t impacted. And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEn2Ij"&gt;While r/WallStreetBets has been at the center of the frenzy around GameStop and AMC stocks, Robinhood has been the tool of choice for many of the small-time and brand new traders jumping in to take part. But this morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;Robinhood blocked new purchases&lt;/a&gt; of stock from GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and others that were spiking in large part because of purchases coming through the app. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;now facing widespread backlash&lt;/a&gt; from users, celebrities, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254909/senate-banking-stocks-sherrod-brown-aoc-gamestop-reddit-hearing"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;re-open purchases on a “limited” basis&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3YKLEt"&gt;It’s still not clear what happened to cause these users’ stakes to be sold off today. But at the very least, it means Robinhood has even more unhappy customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. The platform also enables professors to track the websites students visit during their exams, and bar them from functions like copy / pasting and printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KB23V"&gt;Though Proctorio and similar services have been around for years, their use exploded in early 2020 when COVID-19 drove schools around the US to move a bulk of their instruction online. So, too, has scrutiny towards their practices. Students and instructors at universities around the country have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;spoken out&lt;/a&gt; against the widespread use of the software, claiming that it causes unnecessary anxiety, violates privacy, and has the potential to discriminate against marginalized students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWTjeK"&gt;In an email to instructors, ADA coordinator Allison Kushner and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts wrote that professors who continue to use Proctorio through the summer 2021 term are “expected to accommodate students that raise accessibility issues,” and that the campus is “investigating longer-term remote proctoring options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TRO48O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service “was never considered to be a long-term campus proctoring solution.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEdHm"&gt;Proctorio has been controversial on UIUC’s campus since the service was introduced &lt;a href="https://dailyillini.com/news/2020/04/17/proctorio-concerns/"&gt;last spring&lt;/a&gt;, and concerned students only grew more vocal through the fall 2020 semester. (Due to COVID-19, the school now operates with a hybrid of online and in-person instruction.) Over 1,000 people signed a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/uiuc-stop-proctoring-exams-through-proctorio-proctoru?redirect=false"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the university to stop using the service. “Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy,” reads the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWp9y"&gt;UIUC is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;many campuses&lt;/a&gt; where remote proctoring has faced backlash. A &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/miami-university-end-proctorio-use-at-miami-university"&gt;Miami University petition&lt;/a&gt;, which gathered over 500 signatures, declared that “Proctorio’s design invades student rights, is inherently ableist and discriminatory, and is inconsistent with peer reviewed research.” Over 3,500 signatories have called on the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-regina-administration-call-on-the-university-of-regina-to-remove-proctortrack?redirect=false"&gt;University of Regina&lt;/a&gt; to end its use of ProctorTrack, another automated proctoring service. A 1,200-signature petition urges the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-central-florida-ask-ucf-to-stop-using-honor-lock-which-is-a-severe-invasion-of-privacy"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; to dump Honorlock, another similar software, declaring that “students should not be forced to sign away their privacy and rights in order to take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5cVtd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Professors and staff&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the service as well. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Proctorio (alongside four other test-proctoring services), claiming that the services’ collection of personal information amounts to “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” Even US senators have gotten involved; a coalition including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Proctorio and two similar services in December citing a number of concerns about their business practices. “Students have run head on into the shortcomings of these technologies—shortcomings that fall heavily on vulnerable communities and perpetuate discriminatory biases,” wrote the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJ1qj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdsqZ"&gt;The complaints largely revolve around security and privacy — Proctorio’s recordings give instructors and the service access to some of test-takers’ browsing data, and a glimpse of their private homes in some cases. (Proctorio stated in its &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/Proctorio-senate-response-010721.pdf"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the Senators’ letter that “test-taker data is secured and processed through multiple layers of encryption” and that Proctorio retains its recordings “for the minimum amount of time required by either our customer or by applicable law.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP15AB"&gt;Accessibility is another common concern. Students have reported not having access to a webcam at home, or enough bandwidth to accommodate the service; one test-taker told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she had to take her first chemistry test in a Starbucks parking lot last semester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rEzh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;Students have also reported&lt;/a&gt; that services like Proctorio have difficulty identifying test-takers with darker skin tones, and may disproportionately flag students with certain disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215727/examsoft-online-exams-testing-facial-recognition-report"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that even the best facial-recognition algorithms make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do identifying white ones. Proctorio stated in its response that “We believe all of these cases were due to issues relating to lighting, webcam position, or webcam quality, not race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xv21w0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instructors utilizing Proctorio should inform students that they are aware of the challenges that Proctorio presents”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBBJj4"&gt;“We take these concerns seriously,” reads UIUC’s email, citing student complaints related to “accessibility, privacy, data security and equity” as factors in its decision. It recommends that students for whom Proctorio presents a barrier to test-taking “make alternative arrangements” as the program is phased out, and indicates that accessibility will be considered in the selection of the next remote-proctoring solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A8G9C"&gt;We’ve reached out to UIUC and Proctorio for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SIPC Says It Has Serious Concerns About Robinhood’s New Product" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kzgdUXSF7n4v7Fn6C3gfNJZwkN4=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737535/1073282662.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ryz6V1"&gt;Google is actively removing negative reviews of the Robinhood app from the Google Play Store, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;After some disgruntled Robinhood users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7001b/do_your_part_tank_robinhoods_rating_in_the_app/"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hamiolhs/status/1354789899510149125?s=21"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to give the app a one-star review on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store — and succeeded in review-bombing it all the way down to a one-star rating — the company has now deleted enough reviews to bring it back up to nearly four stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLWSRC"&gt;Robinhood came under intense scrutiny on Thursday, after the stock trading app announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;it would block purchases of GameStop, AMC, and other stocks&lt;/a&gt; made popular by the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, and some users have already replaced their deleted one-star reviews with new ones to make their anger heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zW4jiB"&gt;Here’s a screenshot from the Play Store page &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-android-review-bomb-gamestop/"&gt;captured by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when the app had a one-star rating and nearly 275,000 reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaIxPEHJqzTZ02qlozLuDF8ptjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267034/chrome_Hpo3R74D42.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-android-review-bomb-gamestop/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robinhood’s page on the Play Store earlier on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UsfTya"&gt;And here’s a screenshot we took shortly before publishing this article, showing a nearly four-star rating and around 180,000 reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MHM2dDZYWqrq5PHSgArIEvCNwMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267035/Screen_Shot_2021_01_28_at_3.58.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robinhood’s Play Store rating later on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H7TQQw"&gt;It’s not outside Google’s purview to delete these posts. Google’s policies &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/about/comment-posting-policy/"&gt;explicitly prohibit&lt;/a&gt; reviews intended to manipulate an app’s rating, and the company says &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/in-reviews-we-trust-making-google-play.html"&gt;it has a system&lt;/a&gt; that “combines human intelligence with machine learning to detect and enforce policy violations in ratings and reviews.” Google says it specifically took action on reviews that it felt confident violated those policies, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Google says companies do not have the ability to delete reviews themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xWwvZ"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/robinhood-investing-for-all/id938003185"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood has a 4.7 rating, and we didn’t see any reviews newer than Wednesday. However, popular apps like TikTok, &lt;em&gt;Uno&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact &lt;/em&gt;also didn’t have reviews from any later than Wednesday when we checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQvQ2B"&gt;Unhappy Robinhood users aren’t just using reviews to show their ire — they’re also calling for a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x130/class_action_against_robinhood_allowing_people_to/"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. Later on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;Robinhood said&lt;/a&gt; it would allow “limited buys” of certain stocks on Friday. The company said that halting purchases on Thursday was “a risk-management decision.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gambling apps are coming to Google’s Play Store in the US and 14 other countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rn0PUSNmb09mwPKzRPcfVs08gGQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736980/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XwP73j"&gt;An upcoming change to Google’s Play Store policies will allow gambling and betting Android apps that use real money in 15 more countries, including the US, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/28/google-play-android-gambling-apps/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, gambling apps are only allowed in &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9877032"&gt;four countries&lt;/a&gt;: Brazil, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gA1zel"&gt;The new rules will be applied starting on March 1st, and they’ll permit gambling apps in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Of course, each country will have its own limitations on what kind of online gambling is legal, with some countries allowing online casinos, sports betting, lotteries, and daily fantasy sports, and some being more restrictive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eZ25z"&gt;The restrictions are also complicated. Most countries only allow lotteries if they’re run by the government, but some, like the UK, don’t have that restriction. And as is often the case, what’s allowed in the US varies on a state-by-state basis. Anyone looking to release a gambling app will have to do their legal homework first, considering the patchwork of laws and regulations permitting specific types of online gambling in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="List of the allowed types of gambling products in the US, with the list of states each is allowed in" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8mFm19HsReh1R3ZDC8wjrpyOLg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22266468/Screen_Shot_2021_01_28_at_12.37.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The US has the largest details box by far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zvcAoD"&gt;The change won’t be opening the floodgates for just anyone to release a slot machine app. Currently, Google requires developers to go &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/gambling"&gt;through an application process&lt;/a&gt; to get their gambling apps on the Play Store, and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10318510#zippy=%2Cunited-states"&gt;the new policies&lt;/a&gt; won’t be removing that requirement. The application ensures that the developer uploading the app is licensed to run a gambling operation in the country where the app will be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBACt7"&gt;Before this change, users who wanted to use gambling apps on their Android phones would have to sideload them, a practice that Google &lt;a href="https://phandroid.com/2019/12/06/google-could-soon-prevent-android-users-from-sideloading-apps/"&gt;has been discouraging more and more&lt;/a&gt; as time goes on. iPhone users, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business"&gt;have been allowed to download them&lt;/a&gt; straight from the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijC51N"&gt;Of course, it could be argued that many games and apps that are on the Play Store today already include gambling mechanics (any game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;that includes loot boxes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or apps that allow people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade"&gt;to make bets on Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;). The apps that will be allowed under this policy differ in that they’ll be allowing apps that are purely made for gambling, using real money. If I could make one request to Google, it’d be to let people hide gambling apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;they’re allowed to hide gambling ads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brU20h"&gt;Google was not immediately available to comment on the policy change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stadia’s biggest (timed) exclusive won’t be exclusive anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0EERlykDxdZsw1grlCLc4vmPXF0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68736974/VaultHeist_04.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tIHdzG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294817/google-stadia-crayta-launch-july-1st-state-share-pricing-features-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; timed Stadia exclusivity is coming to an end soon, with developer Unit 2 Games confirming that the title will be making its way to PC “very soon.” Originally announced as a “First on Stadia” timed exclusive,&lt;em&gt; Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s jump to other platforms was always more a question of “when” rather than “if,” but the announcement marks the first official indication of the regular PC port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xd6mZB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia lets you share a URL to your very own game worlds with Crayta, coming July 1st ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21294817/google-stadia-crayta-launch-july-1st-state-share-pricing-features-exclusive"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Dosy2U"&gt;The news — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Yogarine/status/1354490575362383872/photo/1"&gt;originally spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, citing a tweet from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Yogarine/status/1354490575362383872/photo/1"&gt;Twitter user @Yogarine&lt;/a&gt; — comes from an announcement by Unit 2 Games in the game’s Discord chat. The company promises that it’ll have more information (including a launch date and the digital storefront where &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt; will be offered) in the coming weeks, but it does promise that it’s “still every bit as committed to Stadia as we’ve always been.” The new PC version will also offer full crossplay with the Stadia version of &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKV9g2"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-style game creation game that’s built on Unreal Engine, &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;standout feature (aside from the rare status of a Stadia-exclusive title) was as one of the first games to adopt Stadia’s State Share technology, which (in theory) promised that any Stadia player could join a &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt; world simply by clicking on a link. It’s a feature that’ll likely stay exclusive to the Stadia version of the game even after the PC port launches, given its reliance on Google’s streaming tech to pull off. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qepgyE"&gt;Epic Games Store released a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2020-year-in-review"&gt;bevy of stats&lt;/a&gt; to show off how its game storefront grew in 2020 compared to 2019, its launch year. It announced that there are over 160 million accounts now on PC, up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064951/epic-game-store-users-number-cross-play-revenue-valve-steam"&gt;108 million users registered in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It almost doubled in monthly active users from 32 million in December 2019 to 56 million last month. Epic also saw its daily active user count go up to 31.3 million, which the company claims is a 192 percent boost. Its peak concurrent player count hit 13 million in 2020, almost doubling its 7 million peak in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVJUlj"&gt;Unsurprising to no one, giving away free games each week is a nice way to keep people coming back to your storefront. (It also helps when your store is the sole provider of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PC.) There were 103 free games last year, and gamers claimed over 749 million copies. And good news: Epic has committed to continuing this popular tradition of giving away titles in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hwkvyw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic trails far behind Steam, but it’s growing at a steady pace&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="43bxxW"&gt;All of this to say that the Epic Games Store is growing. Gamers spent $700 million within the PC game store in 2020, with $265 million of that being the actual amount spent by gamers on third-party games not made by Epic (excluding the value of coupons and promos used on those games, as well as the value of Epic’s own funding of these developers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5JC4X"&gt;Looking forward, Epic says it’s working to make it easier for developers to publish games on the Epic Games Store. For everyone else, it says it’s working on community-oriented features, including an overhaul to its social components, player profiles, and updates to its achievements and wishlist features. Perhaps, it’ll expand on its efforts to host &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22183446/epic-games-store-spotify-app-store-ambitions"&gt;more than just games&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sZ2xJ"&gt;Barring some totally unpredictable shift in tide in the next 10 years, Steam will always have bigger numbers than the Epic Games Store. But its solid performance in 2020 proves that there’s room in the industry for another competitor to keep growing. And it seems to validate that the ways Epic’s strategy differs from Valve’s (making deals for timed-exclusive games, paying developers more per game purchase) are still resonating with developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
