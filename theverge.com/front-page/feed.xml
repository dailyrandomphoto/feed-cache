    <title>Hummer’s new electric SUV can drive diagonally, with 300 miles of range and a $110,000 price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6Njh_wOktyCwVK7JEuiufSpAnI=/99x0:1169x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072830/hummer_ev_reveal_suv_gal_my23_hummer_suv_VP33__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVTAkg"&gt;Hummer has unveiled the SUV version of its electric pickup truck, which comes with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;up to 300 miles of range and will sell for a suggested retail price of up to $110,595 for its first edition. Reservations for that model are already full, according &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev"&gt;to GM’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnjmLm"&gt;GM, which is producing the electric Hummers under its GMC brand, said the SUV will go into production starting early 2023, with less pricey variants starting at $90,000 in the spring of 2023 and a low-end $80,000 variant with a 250-mile range in the spring of 2024.  Previously, the company said that its electric pickup truck will start assembly at the end of 2021, starting with the most expensive trim level. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJJZ7S5FtPxqFK9zifiZoLlIFEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419232/hummer_ev_suv.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2CfLQb"&gt;Like the pickup, the SUV’s $90K-and-up trim levels come with Crab Walk, which can let the Hummer rotate all four wheels to drive diagonally at low speeds, and Extract Mode, which can use the air suspension system to lift the entire vehicle six inches off the ground to get over large obstacles. It’s also got the same 13.4-inch touchscreen center console display, and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woCOjPpT-MJKTaZJ6lDyNTySs-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419199/hummer_ev_suv_trim_levels.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hummer EV SUV trim levels; you can find a more detailed comparo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/suvs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;at GM’s site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4gEMMP"&gt;GM retired the Hummer brand in 2010. At the time, the boxy behemoth had become a symbol for pre-financial-crisis excess that was made famous by its inclusion in rap videos and television shows like &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Entourage&lt;/em&gt;. But once the global recession hit, and fuel prices stared to rise, Hummer sales dropped and the vehicle was discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4UEGc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10428065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spFypm"&gt;Last year, the company announced it was reviving the nameplate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;as an outrageous, 1,000 horsepower battery-powered pickup truck that can raise and lower its suspension six inches and even drive diagonally&lt;/a&gt;. The Hummer is a cornerstone of GM’s $27 billion push into EVs that will include the release of 30 new vehicles by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQgIkW"&gt;Both Hummers will be among the first vehicles built on GM’s new modular electric battery platform, Ultium, which the company says will deliver power ranging from 50 to 200 kWh, allowing for a driving range up to “400 miles or more.” For trucks, the Ultium platform will include 800-volt battery packs and 350 kW fast-charging capability, equivalent to a 100-mile charge in 10 minutes according to GM; for the SUV, fast charging is limited to 300 kW, and with 170 fewer horsepower at top spec, you’re also looking at 3.5 seconds to go from 0-60, rather than a flat 3.0 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkuBFk"&gt;The vehicles will also feature the second-generation version of GM’s advanced driver assist system, Super Cruise, that allows for “hands-free” highway driving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam survey suggests Nvidia’s RTX 3070 is actually trickling into the hands of gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1Eg_3FntlVA5Tsteg-2FEoRdjw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072667/twarren_201025_4262_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FJD1pF"&gt;Now that the street price of an Nvidia RTX 3070 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;is over $1,200&lt;/a&gt;, it’s temping to think scalpers, bots and cryptocurrency miners got them all — but &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=pct"&gt;the latest Steam Hardware Survey&lt;/a&gt; suggests at least some of them are making their way into gaming PCs, too. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89161-latest-steam-survey-rtx-3070-month-top-performer.html%5C"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechSpot&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the 3070 in particular appears to have become Steam’s fastest growing GPU, and the 17th-most popular graphics accelerator on Steam with a 1.29 percent share overall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDnoHZ5QcnHtNvbOjJKL3-m90MY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419138/top_20_gpus_steam_march_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top 20 GPUs on Steam, as of March 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CO7pls"&gt;The RTX 3080 also commands 0.87 percent, the RTX 3060 Ti has 0.39 percent, and the pricey RTX 3090 claims 0.34 percent of the market — for a total of 2.89 percent Ampere cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcj71q"&gt;That not bad, especially considering AMD’s rival RX 6000 series doesn’t have a single spot on the entire 95-GPU leaderboard. Apparently, more gamers are using the 2011 Nvidia GeForce GTX 550 Ti (0.16 percent) than any of AMD’s latest cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRspTo"&gt;More than a quarter of Steam PC gamers are now using AMD CPUs instead of Intel, though, so that’s probably some consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGQzUL"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;secondhand sales numbers&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, I would expect the newer RTX 3060 to contribute to Nvidia’s tally next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump used dark patterns to trick supporters into donating millions more than intended</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dark Patterns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7GMfcXrEEtMtkJOChXeaNZqKUE=/34x0:1066x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072501/ui_static.1419979789.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Patterns are user interfaces designed to trick you into doing what their creator wants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eebykq"&gt;When Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he didn’t stop asking his supporters for money. The emails kept coming in. But by the end of his four years in office, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html"&gt;a new report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they had begun to look an awful lot like a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8kEtk"&gt;By June 2020, the Trump campaign had begun using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;, computer interfaces designed to trick users, to automatically sign up campaign contributors to donate far more money than they had intended — recurring monthly donations, recurring weekly donations, even a one-time surprise “money bomb” — by &lt;em&gt;pre-checking&lt;/em&gt; the checkboxes for each option, burying the fine print under paragraphs of bold text, and forcing his supporters to wade through it all and opt out if they wanted to make a simple donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G71y3D"&gt;Here’s how bad it got as of October, according to the NYT:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tu5ll0vlLnMymfE0MU05vbUZk5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419046/oakImage_1614036252373_jumbo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6U81eL"&gt;One Kansas City supporter who donated $500 saw his account tapped for $3,000 that month. Another realized their $990 donation had become $8,000. Banks and a major credit card company told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that processing fraud claims for WinRed, the conservative fundraising site processing these payments, had started to become a significant percentage of their daily workload. A Trump spokeperson admitted at least $19.7 million worth of its transactions had been disputed. And those are just from people who bothered to dispute the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgkqDm"&gt;There’s far more in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html"&gt;the full story&lt;/a&gt;, like how WinRed pocketed $5 million worth of payment processing fees from those who asked for refunds, but the good news is that maybe, just maybe, people are finally waking up to the dangers that dark patterns pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lZNFJE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feds are paying attention to dark patterns now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bFrTMK"&gt;California just passed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333506/california-bans-dark-patterns-opt-out-selling-data"&gt;a landmark privacy bill banning dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; last month. Washington state is attempting one as well. Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) planning to reintroduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302199/big-tech-dark-patterns-senate-bill-detour-act-facebook-google-amazon-twitter"&gt;the DETOUR Act&lt;/a&gt; in the next congressional session, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22351108/dark-patterns-ui-web-design-privacy"&gt;according to our sister site &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; spoke to acting FTC chair Rebecca Slaughter about her plans to address dark patterns as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dwhwf"&gt;In the meanwhile, you’ll find dark patterns wherever you look on the web, perhaps nowhere more prominently than the privacy warnings you’ll find on every website you visit these days that attempt to warn you about the cookies they collect, in order to comply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;with EU privacy laws&lt;/a&gt;. In far too many cases, there’s no obvious way to opt out of any data collection whatsoever — instead, there’s a nice bright button that you can press to just give up your data and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6VjEq"&gt;UX designer and consultant Harry Brignull coined the phrase “dark patterns” in 2010. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you"&gt;Here’s the guest post he wrote for us in 2013.&lt;/a&gt; And if you want to laugh and cry at the same time, I highly recommend playing &lt;a href="https://userinyerface.com/game.html"&gt;the free, short online game &lt;em&gt;User Inyerface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a master class in horrific UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber will pay a blind woman $1.1 million after drivers stranded her 14 times</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nxYPkK95p7j9esBYRRx8Q0aHkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072148/akrales_181010_3013_0148.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rRKvDR"&gt;Uber was sued in 2014 for discriminating against blind people and their guide dogs, and agreed to change that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/30/11543922/uber-blind-customers-lawsuit-settlement"&gt;as part of a $2.6 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; two years later. But apparently, that didn’t entirely happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lC7oPa"&gt;Uber will now pay an additional $1.1 million to a blind woman who says said she missed work, missed her birthday celebration, missed Christmas Eve church services, and was left out in the dark, in the rain, and other such humiliations because Uber drivers refused to carry her and her dog on 14 different occasions — a number of which happened &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Uber &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ubers-settlement-with-blind-users-finalized/"&gt;finalized its 2016 settlement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjyLSi"&gt;“Uber allowed drivers who discriminated against disabled riders to continue driving without discipline,” an arbitrator concluded this week (via &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-drivers-refused-rides-to-this-blind-woman-16068416.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqZI7y"&gt;This line from the arbitrator’s report is also worth considering: “When Uber did conduct an investigation, its investigators were trained, in some instances, to coach drivers to find non-discriminatory reasons for ride denials, sometimes even to ‘advocate’ to keep drivers on the platform despite discrimination complaints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlfOY"&gt;Lisa Irving, the woman, isn’t suddenly a millionaire, by the way. The arbitrator awarded her $324,000 in damages, with the rest ($805,313) going to legal costs, including attorney fees. &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-drivers-refused-rides-to-this-blind-woman-16068416.php"&gt;She spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about her dog and her memories, including one where a driver &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; pick her up, then got vocally angry about having a dog in the car and threatened to leave them on the side of the road. She says she was rejected at least 60 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEY3gQ"&gt;Uber now has &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/i-want-to-report-a-service-animal-issue-?nodeId=5f3eac46-e977-44a0-873e-f1881d48f4cb"&gt;a dedicated support form&lt;/a&gt; for issues with service animals. “Was a service animal denied?” is the very first question. Here’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fdocument%2F%3Fname%3Dservice-animal-policy%26country%3Dunited-states%26lang%3Den&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F3%2F22365859%2Fuber-blind-woman-win-arbitration-lisa-irving-guide-dog" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber’s service animal policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrZzPS"&gt;You can read the full arbitrator’s decision below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cable company that prided itself on no data caps says you’re getting data caps because pizza</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQNuCJTfep6nKNxtZxdU5q_ERSE=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69071819/L1030389.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8AeC1"&gt;Internet data caps are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like pizza — where taking a slice could mean fewer slices for everyone else. I don’t think &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers have trouble understanding this concept? It’s been well-established that ISPs have no trouble delivering unlimited data, even during — say — a global pandemic when vast throngs of the population have suddenly found themselves working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="galMAG"&gt;This, however, did&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;stop WideOpenWest (aka WOW!) from using pizza to justify brand-new, possibly-never-before-seen data caps for its cable internet subscribers, starting June 1st, 2021, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/internet-data-is-like-pizza-cable-company-claims-as-it-imposes-data-cap/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecFjFy"&gt;Here’s a portion of the email subscribers are receiving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NPOtLT"&gt;What’s a monthly data usage plan? Let us illustrate …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvMkd5"&gt;Imagine that the WOW! network is a pizza. Piping hot. Toppings galore. Every WOW! customer gets their own slice of pizza, but the size of their slice is dependent on their Internet service plan. While customers who subscribe to 1 Gig get the largest slices, those with Internet 500 get a slightly smaller piece, and so on. But, it’s all the same delicious, high-speed pizza that you know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1JBg2"&gt;Now, say you’re not full after your slice and you grab another. That extra slice is like a data overage. Don’t worry—we got extra pizza... umm, data... just in case. If you exceed your data allowance, we’ll automatically apply increments of 50GB for $10 to your account for the remainder of the current calendar month. Total overage charges will not exceed $50 per billing statement no matter how much data you use. Even better—the first time you experience a data overage, we’ll &lt;strong&gt;proactively waive fees&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="y6o4J4"&gt;To explain how nonsensical that is, here’s a paragraph from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;a story I wrote late last year&lt;/a&gt; which I think you might enjoy reading as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AXhsvX"&gt;Forget for a moment that Comcast itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2015/11/7/9687976/comcast-data-caps-are-not-about-fixing-network-congestion"&gt;was caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs &lt;a href="https://money.com/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/"&gt;have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce&lt;/a&gt;. Forget that Comcast &lt;em&gt;disabled its own congestion management system&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/comcast-says-it-doesnt-throttle-heaviest-internet-users-anymore/"&gt;because it found it was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-4th-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only a tenth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;suspended their data caps&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="87o5kX"&gt;The kicker here is that WOW knows full well its network is nothing like pizza — because for years, including during the pandemic, the company proudly boasted that it &lt;em&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;have a data cap. It was &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;reason to pick WOW over Comcast, one subscriber told &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4dYv4"&gt;Some evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6C8xoi"&gt;To which I say: wow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ru0Z"&gt;What would cause WOW to abandon its values for profit? I can’t say for sure, but I’d hazard a guess it might have been emboldened by Comcast’s recent decision to make data caps the norm across the United States starting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;&lt;s&gt;March&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;&lt;s&gt;July&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291469/comcast-delays-northeast-data-cap-rollout-2022"&gt;sometime next year&lt;/a&gt;. Because that’s the state of internet “competition” in the United States: so few real choices that when one ISP turns up the profits, it’s probably safe for neighboring ISPs to do same. If you’re locked into just one or two bad choices where you live, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;I’d recommend telling the FCC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ultimate Lego Star Wars game has been delayed again, indefinitely, and that’s OK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5HQHX7AnJOU1UBCWUR8fIuyrse4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69071596/Lego_Star_Wars.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bj897V"&gt;If you’ve been eagerly waiting for &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to fulfill the incredible promise of its stirring trailer from last August (see above), I have some bittersweet news: the game’s been delayed again. Developer TT Games &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TTGames/status/1377984167233744899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377984167233744899%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2021-04-03-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-delayed-again"&gt;tweeted on Friday &lt;/a&gt;that “we won’t be able to make our intended Spring release date,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-28-slipped-to-2021-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-has"&gt;which itself was a delay&lt;/a&gt; from the game’s original 2020 launch window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sVPjxi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to all our fans for your continued patience. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tCDV9Ikftd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tCDV9Ikftd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TT Games (@TTGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TTGames/status/1377984167233744899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcolcH"&gt;Bittersweet, because the delay does come with the promise that it’ll be the company’s “biggest and best-ever LEGO game,” which is exactly what that trailer looked like last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1QDX1"&gt;It’s been sixteen years since the first &lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars, &lt;/em&gt;and I can certainly wait a bit longer if there’s a chance of achieving that goal. We’ve seen far too many games shoved out before they were ready, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;I can think of at least one notable reason&lt;/a&gt; any developer might need a bit more time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSLwEk"&gt;It may mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538464/ps5-xbox-series-x-launch-games-list-new-release-holiday-2020-2021"&gt;one fewer game for new PS5 and Xbox Series X / S buyers&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of their new consoles in the short term, though. (It’s coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One and PC as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62XQID"&gt;There’s no new release date for &lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga &lt;/em&gt;yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>25 years later, Space Jam has a new website — and the first trailer for the sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlDArEwX8Wm6K6j2OjeKcChXMpo=/13x0:720x471/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69071395/space_jam.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtSOu5"&gt;Since 1996, &lt;a href="http://spacejam.com"&gt;spacejam.com&lt;/a&gt; has been an internet time capsule &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/20/4245466/how-space-jam-proves-the-internet-is-a-time-capsule"&gt;like few others still in existence&lt;/a&gt; — a largely pristine sample of the early World Wide Web and all the most advanced multimedia offerings available at the time, such as animated GIFs and Windows 95 screensavers. But 25 years later, it’s finally been supplanted; the new sequel &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;starring LeBron James, has taken over the URL to showcase the new movie’s very first trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Coh2aJ"&gt;Here’s what spacejam.com looks like today:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6i-awVduqBS3IyD9gQLyPUM-r0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22418492/chrome_j0GOqtMX2b.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAFEXX"&gt;But before you go boycotting the sequel, you should probably know that the original &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website isn’t dead yet. In fact, it’s just one click away at &lt;a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996"&gt;spacejam.com/1996&lt;/a&gt;, and the new website lets you that original Space Jam logo (in the upper-right-hand corner) to go back in time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OftbiL"&gt;Here’s that new trailer for the LeBron James version — featuring both a cartoon LeBron James, and upscaled CGI versions of the Looney Toons crew as well. Looks like they’ll be breaking into the real world once again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R9CcaH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olXYZOsXw_o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HmNH5y"&gt;Will LeBron go Googling for the original &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website in the film (or, perhaps, will Daffy or Bugs remark that it’s still there?) I think it’s a safe bet. It’ll arrive on July 16th in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;and HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re on the knife’s edge of the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccination Site Opens At Elementary School In Louisville As Kentucky Sees Rise In COVID-19 Cases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZ_kTq730j-toLs0T5slnnqjb0o=/0x0:6063x4042/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69070824/1232071704.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zvCgJ0"&gt;This is a surreal moment in the pandemic, brimming with hope and fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShPTWJ"&gt;Here in the US we’re at the last leg in a marathon — vaccines are here, and appointments to get those shots are becoming more plentiful. People are planning for the moments they’ve put off for a year or more. The finish line is in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdCSYW"&gt;At the exact same time, our will to power through to the end just slammed into a wall. Restrictions are lifting while cases are still high, sending case counts through the roof. Hospitals are getting crowded again. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/coronavirus-testing-declines.html"&gt;Testing has dropped&lt;/a&gt;, leaving us with incomplete information as new variants take hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="TAkG13"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fmD3yy"&gt;“We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope,” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/cdc-director-has-feeling-of-impending-doom-amid-new-spike/2021/03/29/c6fe0458-90ab-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html"&gt;said Rochelle Walensky&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a press conference this week. “But right now, I’m scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEmeD5"&gt;It’s the juxtaposition of pandemic weariness and vaccine euphoria that may make the next few months the most heartbreaking as many people keep getting sick, and some tragically die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hna5Yb"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/31/with-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-loved-ones-feel-the-anguish-of-covid-19-deaths-particularly-hard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, reporter Andrew Joseph writes about the particular agony families are going through as some members get vaccinated at the same time their loved ones pass away from COVID-19. “[A]s the weeks go by,” Joseph writes, “some deaths will increasingly feel like they might not have happened if vaccine campaigns were moving a bit faster, if we could hold off bumps in spread for a bit longer, if we could drive down transmission a bit more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j329zl"&gt;The past year has been riddled with deaths that didn’t need to happen. Earlier this week, Deborah Birx, former coronavirus coordinator under the Trump Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/27/politics/covid-war-deaths-preventable/index.html"&gt;said in a &lt;em&gt;CNN &lt;/em&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; that hundreds of thousands of deaths in the US could have been averted if the government had acted more swiftly. But even after all those lessons and all those unnecessary deaths, the death toll is still growing — slower than before, but it has nowhere to go but up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVDwNt"&gt;Meanwhile, in stark contrast to our &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22327548/covid-19-grief-bereavement-loss"&gt;national grief&lt;/a&gt;, there’s the relief and joy of millions of people getting vaccinated every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kgC2P"&gt;It feels like we live in a permanent state of contradiction. Yesterday, the CDC was loosening travel guidelines for fully vaccinated people, while CDC director Walensky continued to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/02/science/cdc-travel-vaccinated.html"&gt;urge people to stay home and avoid unnecessary travel&lt;/a&gt;. Texas and Mississippi &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56297329"&gt;are lifting mask mandates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/california-reopening-faq.html#link-2fa61dce"&gt;California is easing restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, while President Biden &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/546177-biden-bemoans-too-many-acting-as-if-covid-19-fight-over-it-is-not"&gt;warns repeatedly that the fight is not yet over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wes2H2"&gt;We wait uncomfortably in this liminal space, caught between two potential ways that the next few months could play out before we ultimately cross the finish line. Will we pass through it beaming, with our friends and family at our side? Or will the heavens open with a roar, drenching us, and driving some people off the course before they can reach the end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbnawu"&gt;“You look out the front window and it’s raining,” Nirav Shah, director of Maine’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/as-coronavirus-infections-and-vaccinations-surge-hope-collides-with-dread/2021/04/02/d6bb9ff8-9318-11eb-bb49-5cb2a95f4cec_story.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “but from the back window, it’s sunny. And your house is literally on the cusp of the storm and you don’t know which way it’s going to go — stormy, or is it going to be sunny? That’s sort of where we are in COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEFNpE"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ruP420"&gt;Research &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="muIad4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-showed-how-trials-for-new-drugs-could-be-faster-and-better/"&gt;COVID Showed How Trials for New Drugs Could Be Faster and Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drug trials are usually expensive, time-consuming and inaccessible — but the pandemic showed that they don’t &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to be any of those things. Here’s an interesting interview about how they might change in the future. (Claudia Wallis/&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These tech deals contain zero April Fool-ery</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZXrz0e"&gt;Welcome to April. This month began with, frankly, too many brands insisting on making fools out of themselves. But now that the prankster holiday is behind us, we’re focused on deals that are still happening. This has been a fun week to write about deals because a little bit of everything has seen a discount. There have been several deals lately on game subscriptions, so my colleague Taylor Lyles put together &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348957/best-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale"&gt;a big up-to-date guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you find the best prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LlEHyK"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fqOvNy"&gt;Nomad’s Base Station Pro is half off until Saturday night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ATH8c1"&gt;If you have an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods and are still lamenting the fact that the AirPower charging mat never released, check out this deal. Nomad’s Base Station Pro does what the AirPower promised to do — charge three devices simultaneously — &lt;a href="https://www.pjtra.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeDealExclusiveApril2021&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fbase-station-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and you can get it for $100&lt;/a&gt; instead of $200 through Sunday, April 4th, at 2:59AM ET (Saturday, April 3rd, at 11:59PM PT) when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VOX &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5cwoA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QZHhZ7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O0unjQ"&gt;Save up to $150 on Samsung’s Galaxy S21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOkQ7f"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is currently offering the best prices on a new Samsung Galaxy S21 phone that’s carrier unlocked and works with most carriers globally. The S21 with 256GB of storage is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614285-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_g991uzaexaa_s21_256gb_5g_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F3%2F22364153%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-1password-nomad-base-station-pro-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available in the phantom gray color for $700&lt;/a&gt;. This is notable because it’s the same price as the 128GB version at Amazon right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Li7kix"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="MM2Zzs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dlP4bB"&gt;Get a year of 1Password’s family subscription for half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="56tN6W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can save on 1Password’s password manager for the entire family (up to five people, including those who might live in a different household). One year of the service usually costs $60, but new users can sign up now and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14494353?sid=Verge1PasswordApril21" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spend just $30 over the course of a year&lt;/a&gt;. The monthly cost is just $2.50 to get individual access to the app on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows 10, or browser. This deal expires on April 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5srL8z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10426335" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon apologizes for lying about pee — and attempts to shift the blame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AneGtrqb-sd-IlqOcjX4QwBsvXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69070243/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FbGdDN"&gt;Amazon has issued a rare public apology — but not to its workers, and with no real admission of guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kyRhC"&gt;Over a week ago, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"&gt;was caught publicly lying&lt;/a&gt; to Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) that its workers never feel the need to pee in water bottles (which is, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;a well-documented issue at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"&gt;how it robotically tracks and fires its laborers&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1d3r9e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon denies stories of workers peeing in bottles, receives a flood of evidence in return","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350337/amazon-peeing-in-bottles-workers-exploitation-twitter-response-evidence"},{"title":"How Amazon automatically tracks and fires warehouse workers for ‘productivity’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18516004/amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-centers-productivity-firing-terminations"},{"title":"Amazon keeps trying to troll US Congress members in perplexing new PR strategy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352977/amazon-twitter-feud-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-trolling-labor-pee-bottles"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gOLV7L"&gt;Now, late on the Friday evening before Easter weekend, when few (hat tip to &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-offers-rare-apology-says-will-look-solutions-drivers-peeing-bottles/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are paying attention, &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3sNtTFT"&gt;the company is apologizing to Pocan&lt;/a&gt; — and no one else. Amazon only apologizes for not being “accurate” enough, too — not for actually creating and contributing to situations where workers pee in bottles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jcVfw9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The @AmazonNews account didn’t bother to tweet any of this, BTW&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qky4SW"&gt;In fact, Amazon goes so far as to suggest the whole pee bottle thing is simply a regrettable status quo, pointing out a handful of times when other companies’ delivery drivers were also caught peeing in bottles, as well as embedding a handful of random comments on Twitter that happen to support Amazon’s views. You can almost &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren"&gt;hear Jeff Bezos saying&lt;/a&gt; “Why aren’t these people blaming UPS and FedEx? Let’s get more people thinking about them instead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgr8Rb"&gt;The blog post also strongly suggests that this is only an issue for delivery drivers, not Amazon’s warehouse workers — even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks"&gt;a 2018 expose from an undercover reporter found Amazon warehouse workers were also forced to skip bathroom breaks&lt;/a&gt;, and a worker who spoke to journalists &lt;em&gt;just last week&lt;/em&gt; suggested bathroom breaks were still an issue in 2021. “You’re sitting there and you have to go take a piss, but you don’t want to rack up ‘time off task,’” &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;she told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPG26I"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353929/lawsuit-alleges-amazon-failed-breaks-overtime-wages"&gt;currently facing a lawsuit over missed lunch breaks&lt;/a&gt; as well. And most importantly, all of this is happening in the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;an Amazon union vote in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; that could help shape the future of labor in the United States, let alone at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WszsU0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon is becoming the face of American inequality","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356321/amazon-inequality-bezos-democrats-union-sanders-fulfillment"},{"title":"Why the Amazon union vote is bigger than Amazon","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="84IQeR"&gt;Amazon’s apology to Pocan is the kind of memo that deserves to be annotated, line-by-line, partially because one of its lines is actually fairly good — “Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions” — but because it’s past 1AM here and it turns out &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s blockquote tool doesn’t let me embed tweets, I’ll just give you the primary guts for now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="b4NN8w"&gt;On Wednesday last week, the @amazonnews Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1374911222361956359%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboutamazon.com%2Fnews%2Fpolicy-news-views%2Four-recent-response-to-representative-pocan"&gt;tweeted the following&lt;/a&gt; back to Representative Mark Pocan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWl4sK"&gt;This was an own-goal, we’re unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ViGRDh"&gt;First, the tweet was incorrect. It did not contemplate our large driver population and instead wrongly focused only on our fulfillment centers. A typical Amazon fulfillment center has dozens of restrooms, and employees are able to step away from their work station at any time. If any employee in a fulfillment center has a different experience, we encourage them to speak to their manager and we’ll work to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX37Ak"&gt;Second, our process was flawed. The tweet did not receive proper scrutiny. We need to hold ourselves to an extremely high accuracy bar at all times, and that is especially so when we are criticizing the comments of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTeP8L"&gt;Third, we know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1F47ih"&gt;This is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon. We’ve included just a few links below that discuss the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9OVuU"&gt;Regardless of the fact that this is industry-wide, we would like to solve it. We don’t yet know how, but will look for solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOwyI7"&gt;We will continue to speak out when misrepresented, but we will also work hard to always be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwnE7T"&gt;We apologize to Representative Pocan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jKXWyB"&gt;You can read &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3sNtTFT"&gt;the full version here&lt;/a&gt;. When you’re finished, perhaps check out &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akd54e/she-wees-and-plastic-bags-amazons-pee-scandal-is-much-worse-for-women"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s interview with six &lt;em&gt;female&lt;/em&gt; Amazon delivery drivers&lt;/a&gt;, for whom the pee situation is obviously much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
