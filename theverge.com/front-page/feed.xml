    <title>Microsoft enables Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 for developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nqwLizsuJPAuweze0P_p4nax7QA=/0x20:1219x833/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164306/windowslinux.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PC7NJG"&gt;Microsoft is starting to allow Windows 10 testers to access Linux GUI apps. The first preview of support for GUI applications is available today for Windows Insiders, allowing developers to run GUI editors, tools, and applications to build and test Linux apps. It’s a significant extension for Microsoft’s Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), after the company added a full Linux kernel to Windows 10 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4NeJF"&gt;While it has been possible to run Linux GUI apps within Windows previously using a third-party X server, official support from Microsoft means there’s also GPU hardware acceleration so apps and tools run smoothly. Audio and microphone support is also included out of the box, so Linux devs can easily test or run video players and communications apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VL3C6C30KsPkiwyJLc9b3EzHT7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460021/linuxguiappswindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux GUI apps running on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nbbxu0"&gt;This is all enabled without Windows users having to use X11 forwarding and without users having to manually start an X server. Microsoft automatically starts a &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-initial-preview-of-gui-app-support-is-now-available-for-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2/"&gt;companion system distro&lt;/a&gt; when you attempt to run a Linux GUI app, and it contains a Wayland, X server, pulse audio server, and everything else needed to make this work inside Windows. Once you terminate an app and WSL, then this special distro ends, too. All of these components combine to make it super easy to run Linux GUI apps alongside regular Windows apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDuZWm"&gt;Microsoft is also testing a new eco mode for the Windows Task Manager in this latest test build. It’s an experimental feature that lets you throttle process resources inside Task Manager. It’s really designed to rein in apps that suddenly start taking up lots of system resources, and it could be useful if you want to temporarily throttle back an app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_SUo7b93WP0iaCARdiDo-IEeVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22460025/task_manager_eco.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Eco Mode for Task Manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wLQmw1"&gt;If you’re interested in testing Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 or this new Task Manager feature, you’ll need to install the latest &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/21/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21364/"&gt;Windows Insider build 21364&lt;/a&gt; from the Dev Channel. Be warned: these are designed as developer builds and not for machines you rely on daily.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple approved another secret gambling den, masquerading as a puzzle game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JRo5vHfFyT2XXx-D65QpbOI_JIw=/113x0:1531x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164172/kosta_gambling_den_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xS4HkY"&gt;This morning, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how Apple’s $64 billion-a-year App Store isn’t catching incredibly obvious multimillion-dollar scams&lt;/a&gt; because the company isn’t even bothering to audit its most profitable apps for fraud, and how app developer Kosta Eleftheriou is showing the company how it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Qb4Ts"&gt;But that’s not the only kind of scam Eleftheriou has been uncovering in Apple’s App Store — he has also discovered that Apple’s review teams have been approving games that transform into secret gambling dens when you access them from certain countries (or via VPN). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;We wrote about two of them last Thursday&lt;/a&gt; as if they were an isolated incident, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011"&gt;he’s now found at least two more&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting this may be a trend — including a match-three puzzle game dubbed &lt;em&gt;Lucky Stars&lt;/em&gt; that turns into a casino if you open it in Russia, and a game called &lt;em&gt;Vegas Pirates&lt;/em&gt; that does the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ch7YAx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; app pretends to be a game for kids 4+, but if you are in Russia (or use a VPN) it becomes an online casino that doesn’t even use Apple’s in-app-purchase system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; scam of the day  &lt;a href="https://t.co/VU1XpaiILU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VU1XpaiILU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407589539115011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="5AdBtR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer - “Marina Misko” - has several gambling apps, all posing as games for kids 4+  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These have been on the App Store for several months, and even had multiple updates approved by Apple! &lt;a href="https://t.co/iE8pbljeh9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iE8pbljeh9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407629493989378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XeDpim"&gt;In some ways, they’re even more egregious examples: while it might be more shocking that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;a kids’ monkey-collecting-bananas game would transform into a gambling den&lt;/a&gt;, these new apps would seem to invite extra scrutiny with their gambling-oriented visuals and the fact they pretended a Russian news organization was their “developer website.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DkyAQM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The developer’s website listed on the App Store is &lt;a href="https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV"&gt;https://t.co/mHYeXEn8dV&lt;/a&gt;, a big Russian news outlet. Really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the *privacy policy* link they’ve provided to Apple is the same exact link - and Apple has happily accepted all this! &lt;a href="https://t.co/QIgMg78cnf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QIgMg78cnf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384407638666989573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RlT9fG"&gt;They’re both gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrE0QV"&gt;If you’re looking for shock value, Eleftheriou also spotted this unrelated app the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q37FIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Curated by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt;, for your kids’ safety!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/wFJOc0FeDQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wFJOc0FeDQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1384561527387131904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IaTG06"&gt;Apple is testifying before Congress today — and in an incredibly high-profile court case against Epic Games next month — about how its App Store protects users, justifies the company’s traditional 30-percent cut (reportedly $64 billion last year alone), and shouldn’t be broken up. These kinds of discoveries are giving the company’s critics a lot of ammo.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Magic Leap CEO says second-generation headset will ship later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sUj4DTXHlGLXV93gBwjcXHFbAF0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164124/jbareham_180717_2744_0422.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQtiyp"&gt;Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson says the mixed reality headset company will be shipping limited quantities of a second-generation device at the end of this year, with broader availability in the first quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a4H0Y"&gt;Johnson offered a timeline for the Magic Leap 2 launch in &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/magic-leap-peggy-johnson"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;She says the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20998796/magic-leap-two-ar-headset-prototype-layoffs-low-sales-sundar-pichai-board"&gt;long-awaited device&lt;/a&gt; is half the size of the first-generation headset and about 20 percent lighter. It’s optimized for professional use and is designed to be wearable for long periods, and it’s supposed to double the Magic Leap One’s field of view. “For frontline workers, the product has to be something comfortable that they can wear all day long,” Johnson told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eC5fAi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Magic Leap left the consumer market last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9V1yB"&gt;Magic Leap has spent the past year transitioning from an all-purpose mixed reality company to a specifically business-focused one, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21274638/magic-leap-app-store-partnerships-update"&gt;following a mass layoff&lt;/a&gt; and the departure of founding CEO Rony Abovitz. Johnson, who stepped up as CEO in July 2020, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315864/magic-leap-new-ceo-microsoft-business-vp-rony-abovitz-step-down"&gt;a former Microsoft executive&lt;/a&gt; with a background in enterprise tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mnc1jk"&gt;Johnson told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; that she sees a “massive” opportunity for enterprise AR headsets. But as&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, Magic Leap will have to compete with Microsoft’s HoloLens, which has established a much clearer presence over the past few years. Microsoft was selected last month to supply the US Army &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360786/microsoft-hololens-headset-us-army-contract"&gt;with 120,000 HoloLens headsets&lt;/a&gt;, building on an earlier pilot program. (Johnson says the deal proves there’s lots of room for AR in general, not just Microsoft, to grow.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHPj6F"&gt;Magic Leap is leaving the consumer space just as Apple, Facebook, and Qualcomm — another company where Johnson once worked — are pushing products that bridge the gap between smartphones and full-fledged consumer mixed reality glasses. Apple is rumored to be unveiling a combination &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;virtual and augmented reality device&lt;/a&gt; aimed at developers, while Facebook has promised to launch “smart glasses” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;with Ray-Ban&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021. And Qualcomm is working with manufacturers, including Nreal and Lenovo, on “smart viewers” that can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296100/qualcomm-xr1-smart-viewer-ar-glasses-announce-lenovo-thinkreality-a3"&gt;project virtual screens into real space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpsKxM"&gt;However, most of these companies can rely on other areas for revenue while they’re experimenting with consumer AR. Meanwhile, Johnson says she sees a more viable short-term future in areas like health care or military applications. “The devices are still getting there. They’re not quite right for consumers, but they’re perfect for the enterprise,” she told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Hongqi S9 is the start of a new chapter in China’s automotive story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dv07rxg71vWV1adW8HvXkLkiJoc=/18x0:1566x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69164108/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_10.08.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Silk-FAW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aq3BDc"&gt;China’s original state-owned automaker, First Automobile Works (FAW), has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hongqi-s-series-poised-to-capture-growing-demand-for-new-energy-sports-vehicles-301272143.html"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the first electric vehicle that’s part of the government’s massive Belt and Road project. The Hongqi S9 is a 1,400-horsepower hybrid hypercar created in partnership with Italian engineering and design startup Silk EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayxXkx"&gt;The car was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261795/silk-ev-faw-china-italy-electric-car-hypercar-s9-belt-road"&gt;first teased in February&lt;/a&gt;, but the two companies gave it a proper debut at Auto Shanghai 2021 this week. FAW and Silk EV are only making 99 of them and will start taking orders by the end of this year. They didn’t announce a price tag and also didn’t share many specs for the S9 (besides that the internal combustion engine will be a V8). It was designed by Walter de Silva, known for his past work with Alfa Romeo, Audi, Volkswagen, and Lamborghini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rxPERp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10458416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGNFDB"&gt;The S9 is meant to serve as a halo car above future fully electric vehicles that FAW will develop in China and in Italy as part of the joint venture with Silk EV — an effort &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/silk-faw-hongqi-s-series-electric-vehicle-venture-receives-strong-backing-from-consortium-of-leading-global-financial-institutions-in-china-301265438.html"&gt;that is backed by some of China’s biggest banks&lt;/a&gt;. It’s being developed under FAW’s Hongqi brand, or “red flag,” which the automaker first started using when it pretty much exclusively made cars for high-ranking Chinese government officials, including Mao Zedong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtMAfD"&gt;FAW has said it wants to make Hongqi into China’s first global car brand. There are a number of electric vehicle startups trying to do the same thing — Xpeng has started shipping small volumes of its EVs to Europe, for instance — though they don’t have access to the same scope of resources that a state-owned automaker can tap. (FAW itself even backed one of these startups, Byton. But after Byton ran into financial trouble, FAW has since reportedly absorbed the startup, and offices in the US and Germany have been closed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9jTRR"&gt;And as part of China’s Belt and Road, which involves infrastructure projects of various sizes all across Asia, Europe, and Africa, the Silk-FAW joint venture has the benefit of becoming part of the Chinese government’s larger narrative for the initiative of creating diplomatic and economic opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C97pJQ"&gt;While Italy makes sense as a place to develop such a car, being the home of Ferrari and Lamborghini, it was also the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-china-president-idUSKCN1R40DV"&gt;first G7 nation to endorse the Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. So what is starting out as a curious, limited-run hypercar just may be the beginning of something much bigger with regards to China’s influence on the global market for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="HBNJ0E"&gt;The video shows Jung’s process for putting the speaker together: treating the glass container so the ferrofluid won’t stick, sanding the 3D-printed casing, and wiring up the electromagnetic device. The full prototype in action is a little less mesmerizing than his initial test that’s shown in the video because the blob breaks apart, but Jung says the speaker is still in development. He’s used ferrofluid in artworks before, including a &lt;a href="https://coso.tistory.com/category/Artwork/FERROR"&gt;huge ferrofluid panel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://coso.tistory.com/category/Artwork/Pataphsical%20pond"&gt;ferrofluid “pond.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQJdGm"&gt;Ferrofluid was originally developed by NASA for moving fuel into rocket engines without the help of gravity. It didn’t work out for that purpose, but it did succeed in looking cool as hell and having other practical uses. It can be used for speaker dampers, as a lubricant in ball bearings, or as a sealant in hard drives. Some day it might even be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17449910/ferrofluid-magnetic-nanoparticles-biomedicine-nasa-invention-cancer-infections-neurons"&gt;used in biomedicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgokhX"&gt;The liquid has been used to visualize music before, like in the video below, but having it in a closed container is much more appealing because it’s a very messy substance. Plus it’s just more fun to have a lava lamp responding to your tunes than a vat of liquid chilling next to your speaker system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jztnZh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Axwm-5zng0s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Android 12’s third developer beta helps apps get more from cameras and haptic hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q0Db671QUk8cwdHrsu4mrYDocPs=/0x0:1350x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163990/android12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0nh5eH"&gt;Android 12’s third &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12"&gt;developer preview&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, and among its host of updates are new OS-level tools to help app developers get more out of the camera and haptic hardware found in modern Android flagships. App launch animations, call notifications, and linking between apps are among the other tweaks made in this release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9ULvY"&gt;It’s a developer-focused beta, meaning much of this could change before Android 12’s full release later this year. However, it’s likely to be the last preview before Android 12 enters beta next month and receives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;an official unveiling at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the preview should provide some useful hints about Google’s priorities for the next major version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxddX7"&gt;First up, the preview gives developers more options for how to offer haptic feedback in their apps, an important development given the big strides Apple has taken with haptic feedback on its devices. Google says these new haptic feedback options should help with everything from UI events to effects in gaming. The APIs are optimized for the Pixel 4 at the moment, and Google says it’s working with other manufacturers to expand support across more devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7LRg1s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App startup animations are getting an overhaul&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zq2Er3"&gt;There’s also better camera support for ultra high-resolution sensors, like those with Quad or Nona Bayer patterns such as the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Platform-level APIs will help developers make better use of these cameras, Google says, which should translate to better performance from third-party camera apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EiukKA"&gt;There are also a couple of tweaks to the general look and feel of Android. Call notifications are getting a new template to make them more visible, easier to understand at a glance, and more consistent with other notifications. The way Android handles links to specific apps is also changing to open your browser by default, rather than the standard app chooser dialog box. Finally, app launch animations are also getting a makeover, including new splash screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCBabi"&gt;There are also many more under-the-hood tweaks Google is making with the third developer preview, touching everything from how apps offer alarms, to machine learning and debugging options. If you’re a developer, you can grab the new preview now from &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get"&gt;Google’s developer site&lt;/a&gt; for the Pixel 3 and newer (or else you’ll receive the new preview as an update if you’re already running the developer preview). The new preview is also available in Google’s Android emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung will help you turn your old Galaxy phone into a smart home sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HMKZW7exSYWuuiHTrP72mMxRLlc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163892/Galaxy_Upcycling_at_Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature can alert you to the sound of a crying baby or turn on a lamp when light levels dip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXHVnM"&gt;Samsung has launched a beta program to help put some older Galaxy phones to new uses. Owners of certain phones can download an update to turn the device into a smart home sensor with some neat functions — it can detect the sound of a crying baby or turn on a lamp when it gets dark. The program is limited to certain models launched in 2018 or later, which is fairly limited, but it’s a nice, accessible offering that could help users get a little more use out of their old devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczh9A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-latest-innovations-for-a-better-normal-at-ces-2021"&gt;Announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the company is launching the program in the US, UK, and Korea starting today. By downloading a software update through the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smartthings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmartThings app&lt;/a&gt;, users can access two basic functions. The first is an audio sensor that detects the sound of a baby crying, pet barking or meowing, or a knock at the door. When it detects one of these, it sends an alert to your phone with a recording of the sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mb2b7M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Galaxy S, Note, and Z-series phones launched from 2018 onward are eligible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HX79N0"&gt;The other function is a light level sensor that can turn on a connected light automatically when brightness levels in a room fall below a certain threshold. Samsung says the update includes battery optimization necessary to keep the phone powered and functioning as a sensor for long periods of time, though the company doesn’t specify how long it would be able to run between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E93Ex7"&gt;Galaxy S, Note, and Z-series phones launched from 2018 onward are eligible, provided they’re running Android 9 or later. Samsung says more devices will be supported in the future, which hopefully includes more budget-oriented devices that owners may be less likely to trade in. And if those limited functions don’t appeal, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542079/phone-reuse-android-iphone-how-to"&gt;a lot more you can do with your old phone&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t mind a DIY approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What we’re learning from the rare cases of COVID-19 in vaccinated people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoIh5z6tnvRpOrt8hCGCNhx1n28=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163881/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lbKwgt"&gt;Among the more than 75 million people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in the United States by the second week of April, there were only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;5,814 reports&lt;/a&gt; of coronavirus infections — a staggeringly low number that shows just how effective the shots are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxSCIo"&gt;Because the vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective, some breakthrough infections were inevitable and expected. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is watching them closely. Studying those cases will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;help experts make sure the vaccines are working as expected and understand any factors that make it more likely that a vaccinated person would get sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpLIDf"&gt;Currently, the CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;national database&lt;/a&gt; where state health departments can send reports of any cases of COVID-19 in people who have been vaccinated. Because COVID-19 is a notifiable disease, which means every case has to be reported to the CDC, the agency will eventually use a different system, called the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) to find breakthrough infections. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;Right now&lt;/a&gt;, it’s working to make sure that states can include vaccination history in NNDSS reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kdg1gf"&gt;Almost a third of the breakthrough infections reported to the CDC were asymptomatic. Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;396 people&lt;/a&gt; were hospitalized, and a third of that group was in the hospital for a reason other than COVID-19 — that is, the disease was not the reason they were seriously ill, they just happened to also test positive for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EntBS"&gt;“Most of those have been mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. That’s exactly what we were hoping for,” Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at the Kent State University College of Public Health in Ohio, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-about-5-800-breakthrough-infections-reported-fully-vaccinated-people-n1264186"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKa3Ml"&gt;Two new reports from the CDC published today gave more details about outbreaks of COVID-19 in vaccinated people. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e2.htm?s_cid=mm7017e2_w"&gt;One described a Kentucky nursing home&lt;/a&gt; where 90 percent of residents and around half of staffers were fully vaccinated. After an unvaccinated staffer came down with COVID-19, a total of 46 people tested positive for the virus. Four cases were in fully vaccinated staffers and 18 were in fully vaccinated residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acmSkX"&gt;Notably, the Kentucky&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;outbreak was linked back to a variant form of the coronavirus referred to as the R.1 lineage. It has a number of mutations in common with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;variant viruses&lt;/a&gt; first identified in South Africa and Brazil, which experts think might partially evade antibodies produced by the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tws792"&gt;The infections by the R.1 virus found in vaccinated people support some of those concerns, the CDC said in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e2.htm?s_cid=mm7017e2_w"&gt;its report&lt;/a&gt;. But the vaccines still worked: unvaccinated nursing home residents were three times as likely to get infected during the outbreak as vaccinated residents. During this outbreak, the shots were around 87 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19, the report found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFjTLs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e1.htm?s_cid=mm7017e1_w"&gt;The second report&lt;/a&gt; tracked infections in vaccinated people at 75 Chicago nursing homes. Across nearly 8,000 vaccinated residents and 7,000 vaccinated staffers, there were only 22 coronavirus infections. Fourteen were asymptomatic and five had only mild symptoms. None of the 22 people appeared to pass the infection on to anyone else. That shows how important high levels of vaccination can be in settings like nursing homes, the report noted. Even if a vaccinated person gets sick, they’re not likely to set off a chain of infections that could spread through a facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq8EqT"&gt;That’s key in stopping the spread of disease overall. People who have their shots might still get sick, even though it happens very rarely, but they probably won’t pass the virus to anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bahNEa"&gt;Vaccinated people who get COVID-19 may find the experience &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Four-columnists%2Fthe-mystery-of-breakthrough-covid-19-infections&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395551%2Fcovid-vaccine-breakthrough-infection-rare-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disorienting&lt;/a&gt;, but the close investigations into the circumstances around these cases highlight just how powerful the vaccines are. &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;Over half of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the US have had their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As more and more people get vaccinated, the pool of people who will catch COVID-19 steadily shrinks, and less of the virus will circulate around a community. And when levels of the virus drop, vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike are less likely to be exposed to it and less likely to catch it themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3tfiW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags will work with Android... sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in a blue, leather holster, attached to a black bag." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCSMVEWYmDfbODYngQNfZfM47FA=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163879/Apple_airtag_accessories_bag_042021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6Gqeg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have one feature not mentioned during the announcement yesterday: they’ll work with Android to a limited extent. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/lost-airtag-can-be-read-by-any-other-nfc-enabled-iphone-or-android-device/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s site that details how AirTags will work with an Android device if you don’t have your iPhone handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k02FLB"&gt;The way AirTags function is by securely communicating with Bluetooth devices and iPhones equipped with ultra-wideband that are in the area. If AirTags exclusively worked with Apple devices it would severely limit their effectiveness, particularly in regions where iPhones aren’t as popular as Android. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A moving image of a phone tapping an AirTag and a link appearing in the notifications on the phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yinUHviyNXw9xFiPoJMZhbSjFrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459713/ios14_iphone12_pro_nfc_notification_animation_crop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any NFC-equipped phone should be able to just tap the AirTag to get more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9sFmtd"&gt;AirTags won’t work out of the box with an Android device, nor can you use an Android device in lieu of an iPhone with one. Instead, it will only work with Android devices equipped with NFC and only communicate when the AirTags are in Lost Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93EfhH"&gt;First, you’ll need to use your iPhone to activate Lost Mode, which is supposed to show you on a map where your AirTag has wandered off to. Then if someone with an Android device finds your lost AirTag, they can hold it up to their NFC-equipped phone and get details on how to contact you. They’ll only be able to get details if the Lost Mode is activated, which should help with privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZskdY"&gt;The Android support makes AirTags way more useful, but if you want the full experience on an Android device, you’ll probably want to take a gander at Tile’s offerings. The company is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;working on an AirTag competitor&lt;/a&gt; that should work on both iOS and Android. Samsung also has its own AirTag competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Like the AirTags and planned Tile offering, the Galaxy SmartTags use UWB to provide a more exact location for a lost tag. The Galaxy SmartTags only work with Samsung Galaxy phones, but unlike AirTags and the Tile tag, Galaxy SmartTags are available now and start at $29.99. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DJWt7y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1384771145606451205"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau tweeted pictures&lt;/a&gt; of some attachable gaming triggers the company has created, and they’re made for more than just OnePlus’ phones. &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/oneplus-gaming-trigger-may-confuse-your-senses-23665133/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashGear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/03/oneplus-mobile-gaming-trigger-accessory-oneplus-9-pro-video-games.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;noticed them being teased during the unveiling of the OnePlus 9 back in late March, but they’re available online now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395588%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers-ios-android-phone-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in India from the OnePlus site&lt;/a&gt; for 1,099 rupees, which converts to roughly $15. OnePlus hasn’t confirmed that these gaming triggers will be releasing globally, and the company wouldn’t comment on pricing and availability when I reached out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAJVet"&gt;These triggers can be clipped around the edge of most phones (any Android or iOS device, so long as they’re less than 11.5mm thick with a case on). If you want to do some mobile gaming but hate touch controls, these could provide a more intuitive, controller-like alternative to tapping on your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQs958"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We designed the OnePlus gaming triggers to be solid, responsive, pleasingly “clicky,” and, yes, beautiful. We also made sure they work with many other phones—because the best product design is one that leaves you free to make your own choices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJNa4Dsa5s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJNa4Dsa5s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1384771145606451205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f227p8"&gt;Each trigger appears to have just one shoulder button with an Omron switch that Lau says are “pleasingly clicky” to tap. Some of the pictures make it seem like there’s also a rear trigger, which would give you a second button to map, but OnePlus didn’t provide any further details on how the mechanism worked when I asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLkTjQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395588%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers-ios-android-phone-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to the product page&lt;/a&gt;, these triggers are interchangeable and can be fastened to your phone in whatever way is most comfortable to you. To use them, though, your game of choice needs to allow for deep customization of its touch controls, to the level of allowing you to move touch-activated zones to where these triggers’ conductive silicon pads clip onto your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6DdWb"&gt;If you’re serious about mobile gaming, these triggers could level the playing field if you’re up against gamers who are playing on phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt; or others that feature ultrasonic sensors laid along their edge to mimic physical shoulder buttons. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Black Shark 4 lineup&lt;/a&gt; features actual mechanical shoulder buttons built into the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8sP6Y"&gt;OnePlus’ option seems to be a solid, budget-friendly option for making your phone easier to game on, though there’s a downside if you value your phone’s expansive screen real estate: these clamps obscure parts of the screen. But if they’re as easy to clip on and remove as OnePlus’ photos indicate, I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;
