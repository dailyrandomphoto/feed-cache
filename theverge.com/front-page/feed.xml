    <title>Motorola is updating its first-gen foldable Razr — with Android 11</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PYMq5g"&gt;You could be forgiven for forgetting about Motorola’s folding phones in light of new shiny ones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22613790/samsung-galaxy-fold-flip-3-event-watch-announcements"&gt;announced by the likes of Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but someone at the company must care about them — &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/motorola-razr-update/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new OS update has been released for the 2019 Razr&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it from Android 10, to Android 11 (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/08/13/motorola-razr-android-11-update/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Yes, that’s correct — the OS that &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-update-tracker-1155652/"&gt;started hitting Pixels in September of 2020&lt;/a&gt; is the one that became available for the Razr today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsn1DE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The original Razr reboot and the Razr 5G both became available in 2020. However, the first one was announced in 2019, so I’ll refer to it as the 2019 Razr to help avoid confusion between it and the Razr 5G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vZq3an"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting the update only a few months after its much better successor isn’t too shabby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBk7g7"&gt;While it may seem like the update for the 2019 Razr is woefully late, consider this: according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/27/the-moto-razr-5g-is-finally-getting-android-11-catching-up-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold2/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://motorola-mobility-en-in.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/2014"&gt;Motorola’s updates page&lt;/a&gt;, Android 11 started rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;much better 2020 Razr 5G&lt;/a&gt; sometime between April and July. For how first-gen the 2019 Razr is, getting the update only a few months after its successor isn’t too shabby (despite the fact that getting it almost a year after it started rolling out is pretty rough, on an absolute timescale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLBHVM"&gt;Motorola’s update issues aren’t limited to its foldables, however. Many of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311690/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs"&gt;recent phones&lt;/a&gt; only come with the promise of two years of security updates, with some higher-end ones getting one major OS update. Given that the Razr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255018/motorola-razr-foldable-external-display-android-10-update-new-features"&gt;already got an upgrade to Android 10&lt;/a&gt; (in May of 2020), today’s update puts it at two feature updates, which is better than what Motorola promises for some of its non-folding phones. And it should be, given that the phones Motorola promises two years of security updates for cost between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;$160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;$400&lt;/a&gt; — the 2019 Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;$1,500 at launch&lt;/a&gt;. (Though that isn’t to say that a $400 phone should only get two years of updates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqCKBv"&gt;Still, if you’re still rockin’ an original Razr reboot, it’s an update you didn’t have before. You can read our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;full rundown of what Android 11 adds here&lt;/a&gt;, but the summary is that it brings chat app bubbles, more granular privacy permissions, and a more feature-packed power menu. Just do yourself a favor and don’t look too much at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;the features&lt;/a&gt; that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;getting ready to drop with Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, because it’s hard to imagine that it’ll come to the older Razr anytime soon, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A judge has ruled that Google infringed on Sonos’ patents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/epzNXcpyn34NK_hAGLAwxhYqWuE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723642/bfarsace_190826_3621_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tvsZA6"&gt;Google has infringed upon Sonos’ patents, according to &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21041851-itc-judge-decision-sonos-v-google/"&gt;an initial ruling&lt;/a&gt; from a US International Trade Commission judge. Sonos has been locked in a legal battle with Google after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;it sued the search giant&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it had infringed on five of its patents relating to smart speakers. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sonos says that the ruling “is only a first step in a lengthy battle” but calls it an “important milestone in the ongoing effort to defend Sonos’ technology against Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQpa1"&gt;The suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;began in January of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with Sonos alleging that Google stole technology it had access to as part of a partnership between the two companies. In the lawsuit, Sonos says that Google used that tech in its own products and undercut Sonos. As part of its suit, Sonos asked for a sales ban on tons of Google hardware, including Nest Hubs, Chromecasts, and Pixel phones. The suit has since set off a legal battle between the two companies, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288161/google-countersues-sonos-patents-infringement"&gt;Google filing a countersuit&lt;/a&gt; and Sonos starting another case, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492671/sonos-google-patents-infringement-lawsuit-wireless-audio"&gt;claiming that Google had infringed five more patents&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the original five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="snTrRM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t a final decision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ZamjR"&gt;The commission found that Google had infringed on all five of the patents the company had cited in the original suit. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/13/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, this isn’t a final decision. The International Trade Commission will have to consider the case as well and issue its own ruling, which will happen on December 13th. The decision is also only for one case — there’s still &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/google-sonos-slammed-by-court-over-sprawling-patent-dispute"&gt;the mess of other lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; the two companies are embroiled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjg1sD"&gt;The ruling comes as Sonos has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623470/sonos-survey-voice-assistant-google-fight"&gt;reportedly been surveying customers&lt;/a&gt; on whether they’d want a feature called “Sonos Voice Control,” which would seemingly add some more smarts to the company’s speakers (though some Sonos products &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/alexa-on-sonos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;already support Amazon’s Alexa&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgirs0"&gt;There’s also the backdrop of antitrust complaints against Google. In its statement, Sonos says that its effort against Google is meant to “ensure all companies, regardless of size, receive fair compensation for investing in the development of industry leading technology.” In other words, Sonos is painting itself as the little guy going up against the Goliath. Sonos’ CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21070812/sonos-tile-basecamp-popsocket-congressional-hearing-amazon-google-apple-competition"&gt;has even testified in front of Congress&lt;/a&gt; that big tech companies like Google harm competition in their quest to be everything to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUuBy2"&gt;Google spokesperson José Castañeda gave the following statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ziZNwG"&gt; We do not use Sonos’ technology, and we compete on the quality of our products and the merits of our ideas. We disagree with this preliminary ruling and will continue to make our case in the upcoming review process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Earth just had the hottest month since humans have kept track </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-TURKEY-FIRE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ydf_v7ScOqj2IhziQY80nPGRoo=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723413/1234435483.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Locals use water hoses to extinguish burning trees in Mugla on August 3, 2021. Turkey’s struggles against its deadliest wildfires in decades came as a blistering heatwave gripped southeastern Europe in July and August, creating tinderbox conditions that Greek officials blame squarely on climate change. | Photo by YASIN AKGUL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3T8Bp"&gt;July 2021 was officially the hottest month humans have ever recorded. This July narrowly beat out three previous months in 2016, 2019, and 2020 that had tied for the previous title. The fact that all of this has happened so recently just screams climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qEDVM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fact that all of this has happened so recently just screams climate change.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2yreB2"&gt;“In this case, first place is the worst place to be,” Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/its-official-july-2021-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. NOAA confirmed the new temperature record today, which Spinrad said, “adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ju43h9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;(2 of 5)  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/July?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#July&lt;/a&gt; 2021 global surface temp was 1.67°F (0.93°C) above avg -- making it the hottest July recorded to date.&lt;a href="https://t.co/xKGLizOml4"&gt;https://t.co/xKGLizOml4&lt;/a&gt;  via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAANCEIclimate?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NOAANCEIclimate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StateOfClimate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StateOfClimate&lt;/a&gt; report &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/July2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#July2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8hHkF8ndVM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8hHkF8ndVM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NOAA (@NOAA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAA/status/1426195568100007939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DVxGS"&gt;Scientists have more evidence than ever that links climate change to more extreme weather, especially when it comes to heat. By burning fossil fuels, humans have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;influenced the weather around the world&lt;/a&gt;, a major new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;United Nations climate report&lt;/a&gt; said definitively when it was published earlier this week. Almost every region of the world, apart from the polar regions, has seen a rise in extreme heat events since the 1950s, according to the new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owJeEv"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said in an August 9 press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vzbY5C"&gt;&lt;q&gt; ‘&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;virtually impossible’&lt;/a&gt; without climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bNSDVH"&gt;While last month was the hottest month in the books &lt;em&gt;globally&lt;/em&gt; since records started 142 years ago, the heat was particularly bad in some regions. July absolutely smashed the land-surface temperature record for the entire Northern Hemisphere, according to NOAA. Asia also had its hottest July on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxHLnO"&gt;Such unprecedented heat can take a heavy toll even in typically cooler regions, especially since people and infrastructure there haven’t had to adapt to such hot summers — until now. Southwest Canada and the Pacific Northwest, for example, have suddenly suffered repeated heatwaves this summer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;mangled roads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;killed hundreds of people, sent thousands more to emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;, and fueled massive wildfires. The most severe heatwave to hit, which took place in late June, would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change, an international team of researchers determined. It was also declared the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;“most extreme” summer heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in North America since records began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzfikT"&gt;August has been scorching, too. &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/dangerous-heat-wave-to-bake-northwest-set-record-highs-in-seattle-portland/996889"&gt;Another heatwave&lt;/a&gt; is bearing down on the Pacific Northwest. Europe might have seen its &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;hottest day on record on August 11&lt;/a&gt;, when the mercury rose to 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sicily, Italy. The World Meteorological Organization is still working to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;verify that record.&lt;/a&gt; But if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, the world is likely to see more and more temperature records fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit launches a TikTok-like video feed on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdhcRJ5b6ulX4oI91R2QqFxuOl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723291/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YroA8w"&gt;If you opened your Reddit app today and noticed a new video button next to the search bar, you could be a tap away from experiencing the forum platform’s take on TikTok. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writes that the video feed, which pulls content from subreddits you follow along with some you don’t, started rolling out to iOS users on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGvuIr"&gt;Loading up the feed on my own Reddit iOS app, the experience is unavoidably TikTok-like. You can scroll through a vertical, perpetual list of videos featuring content from the wide world of Reddit. Interaction options include upvoting and downvoting, along with commenting, “awarding” (using Reddit’s in-app currency to purchase medals and reactions), and sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3Dunqfr9nYAM5odNvpYcbV30AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781201/66077368_EA5F_4728_9D41_DF790EBC4C7E.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video feed in the Reddit iOS app looks a lot like TikTok.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgKr-2-f-0y_6QFwWcdidET_zKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781200/3D11EAB5_4D9C_4A7E_ACA0_9BD59A0C5C5B.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reddit video feed allows you to upvote, downvote, and comment on videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IfFe6T"&gt;What’s not clear is how Reddit pulls video content from subreddits you don’t follow. TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfczi2cI6Cs"&gt;is famous for its algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, but when &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; asked if Reddit deployed something similar, the company declined to comment. When asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;how it recommends content, and if the video feature had an official title, Reddit also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SvEaU"&gt;It shouldn’t be too surprising that Reddit is pushing further into video. Not necessarily because other platforms and social networks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; have their own TikTok competitors, but because Reddit implied as much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;when it acquired Dubsmash&lt;/a&gt;. The creative video app isn’t involved in this specific feature, but Reddit still intends to incorporate its video tools — and entirely new ones — into its platform going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pf5e2y"&gt;Reddit hasn’t shared specific details on when you can expect the feature to hit your device, or if it’ll come to Android, but it is rolling out now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is changing the contrast of buttons again after complaints of eye strain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSZJQi4J1xPhMf1Uc59YFylz1ro=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723254/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yjh9X1"&gt;Twitter is readjusting the contrast on its buttons following feedback about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620438/twitter-changes-font-chirp-design-icon"&gt;design updates&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this week. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitters-new-font-chirp-is-apparently-giving-some-users-headaches/"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; eye strain, headaches, and migraines due to the higher visual contrast in the colors of buttons and links, as well as the new font, Chirp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9zHjO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're making contrast changes on all buttons to make them easier on the eyes because you told us the new look is uncomfortable for people with sensory sensitivities. We're listening and iterating.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Accessibility (@TwitterA11y) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1426260504687824905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YiVFhC"&gt;The changes in contrast also included a black follow button that’s filled in if you’re not following someone, which has caused confusion for many people who are used to it being the other way around. It’s not clear yet if that change will be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gszw06"&gt;As tends to happen any time a popular site changes its design, immediate reception to Twitter’s changes was mixed. It’s likely that some Twitter users would’ve gotten used to the update over time. But for those who say the new design has caused them pain, the change highlighted a common problem in online accessibility: a lack of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSc2Ih"&gt;Accessibility isn’t one size fits all; a feature that makes a site more accessible for one person can make it harder to use for another. High contrast is often useful for people who have low vision or are colorblind, but it can be painful for people who are sensitive to bright colors or light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mdpkKy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a great example of how some access needs routinely get centered over others within "accessible" processes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High contrast is notoriously NOT accessible for many photosensitive &amp;amp; chronically pained folks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/c1AQNkMvC0"&gt;https://t.co/c1AQNkMvC0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Haagaard (they/them) (@alexhaagaard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhaagaard/status/1425594727429193732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFS78x"&gt;There is no single most accessible option for Twitter’s interface. The best accessibility comes from flexibility, allowing users to choose the options that work for them. Twitter currently has toggles in its accessibility menu for settings like increased color contrast and reduced motion, as well as display settings that let people choose between light and dark themes or scale text sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vboshr"&gt;It could save a lot of headaches if users had more granular options and could select the level of contrast that suits them, rather than having to wait on Twitter to make universal changes. Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but its @TwitterA11y account has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1425831833892179969"&gt;soliciting feedback&lt;/a&gt; about the changes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says its iCloud scanning will rely on multiple child safety groups to address privacy fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ia0PCmtxH75mxbYkGpWC9GLEEtk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723200/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VHOhKl"&gt;Apple has filled in more details around its upcoming plans to scan iCloud Photos for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) via users’ iPhones and iPads. The company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2Fpdf%2FSecurity_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22623859%2Fapple-icloud-photos-csam-scanning-security-multiple-jurisdictions-safeguard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released a new paper&lt;/a&gt; delving into the safeguards it hopes will increase user trust in the initiative. That includes a rule to only flag images found in multiple child safety databases with different government affiliations — theoretically stopping one country from adding non-CSAM content to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAlWLt"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS and iPadOS releases will automatically match US-based iCloud Photos accounts against known CSAM from a list of image hashes compiled by child safety groups. While many companies scan cloud storage services remotely, Apple’s device-based strategy has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;drawn sharp criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some cryptography and privacy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNC7E2"&gt;The paper, called “Security Threat Model Review of Apple’s Child Safety Features,” hopes to allay privacy and security concerns around that rollout. It builds on &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; with Apple executive Craig Federighi, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623336/craig-federighi-apple-icloud-photos-iphone-ipad-csam-scanning-auditability"&gt;outlined some of the information&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GWcN8"&gt;In the document, Apple says it won’t rely on a single government-affiliated database — like that of the US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC — to identify CSAM. Instead, it will only match pictures from at least two groups with different national affiliations. The goal is that no single government could have the power to secretly insert unrelated content for censorship purposes, since it wouldn’t match hashes in any other database.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A venn diagram with one circle labeled “Apple Child Safety Organization #1 hash list,” one labeled “Child Safety Organization #2 hash list,” and the overlap labeled “Apple only uses the intersecting hashes of two or more child safety organizations.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfZtkVvGXvygEumbVZ86p-PnRRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781290/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_3.35.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2Fpdf%2FSecurity_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22623859%2Fapple-icloud-photos-csam-scanning-security-multiple-jurisdictions-safeguard" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xv3FdB"&gt;Apple has referenced the potential use of multiple child safety databases, but until today, it hadn’t explained the overlap system. In a call with reporters, Apple said it’s only naming NCMEC because it hasn’t yet finalized agreements with other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XByiVR"&gt;The paper confirms a detail Federighi mentioned: initially, Apple will only flag an iCloud account if it identifies 30 images as CSAM. This threshold was picked to provide a “drastic safety margin” to avoid false positives, the paper says — and as it evaluates the system’s performance in the real world, “we may change the threshold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqgB8O"&gt;It also provides more information on an auditing system that Federighi mentioned. Apple’s list of known CSAM hashes will be baked into iOS and iPadOS worldwide, although the scanning system will only run in the US for now. Apple will provide a full list of hashes that auditors can check against child safety databases, another method to make sure it’s not secretly matching more images. Furthermore, it says it will “refuse all requests” for moderators to report “anything other than CSAM materials” for accounts that get flagged — referencing the potential for using this system for other kinds of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBhTTw"&gt;Federighi acknowledged that Apple had introduced “confusion” with its announcement last week. But Apple has stood by the update itself — it tells reporters that although it’s still finalizing and iterating on details, it hasn’t changed its launch plans in response to the past week’s criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola announces $2 million DOE grant after founder’s indictment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iDixNrGGE90b9o6nG1RMNCEf3is=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715640/nikola_tre2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nikola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qC5F6U"&gt;This week hydrogen trucking startup Nikola announced that it won a $2 million grant from the Department of Energy. While the DoE &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-awarded-u-s-department-of-energy-grant-128"&gt;announced the grants in July&lt;/a&gt;, Nikola is promoting the news just two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;founder and former chairman Trevor Milton was indicted for allegedly committing fraud&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oH6gxD"&gt;The grant is meant to help Nikola research autonomous refueling technologies for hydrogen refilling stations. It was awarded by the DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy transportation office as part of its Hydrogen and Fuel Cells R&amp;amp;D program, which is focused on proving the reliability and sustainability of using hydrogen as a zero-emissions power source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdx303"&gt;The DOE grant comes at a time when the department is getting ready to ramp up funding activity to help advance the United States’ development of clean energy technologies — a priority under President Biden. One of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-granholm-interviews-energy-loans-5ceef97a73fc04fe3cca75bf84e91327"&gt;first moves&lt;/a&gt; after she was appointed was to revive the department’s loan program, which has been largely dormant since the early Obama administration. That program made a number of bets on clean energy startups in the aftermath of the recession that blew up in the administration’s face, like solar tech company Solyndra (which went bankrupt after China dramatically drove down the cost of solar panels) and Fisker Automotive (which went bankrupt after problems with its battery supplier). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X8J5Ab"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration is likely going to get pretty active with grants and loans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxugk"&gt;The DOE loan program also helped some companies survive the tumultuous years of the early clean tech boom, like Tesla. “If you want to have the leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the world... you’ll have to make multiple bets. And some of those bets will lead to losses,” new loan program head Jigar Shah said &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-jigar-shah-plans-to-manage-does-40b-loan-programs-office"&gt;when he was tapped earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s separate from the grant programs, the DOE loan program is known to be in discussions with at least one other troubled EV startup: Lordstown Motors, which has said for months now that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.tribtoday.com/news/local-news/2021/01/lmc-moves-forward-in-loan-program/"&gt;in the “due diligence” phase of a request from about $200 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzuBGC"&gt;Nikola has spent much of the last year trying to rebound from Milton’s ousting, which came after he was accused of lying about the progress the startup had made by the time it went public. Short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;report last September&lt;/a&gt; that tried to make the case that Nikola was an “intricate fraud,” including the now famous claim that the startup had staged a video showing one of its trucks operating by secretly rolling it down a hill. The report torpedoed General Motors’ decision to take an 11 percent stake in Nikola, and Milton resigned soon after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w13FDS"&gt;Nikola eventually performed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-02-26/money-stuff-startups-sometimes-stretch-the-truth"&gt;an internal investigation that confirmed Milton had lied, a lot&lt;/a&gt;, and the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into his claims. Last month, they filed parallel criminal and civil charges against Milton as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMdHb9"&gt;Nikola is still losing around $100 million per quarter, and it had around $630 million in the bank at the end of the second quarter of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku7Lzd"&gt;“Autonomous fueling is part of the industry’s effort to ensure fast, efficient, and safe fueling of a large onboard storage system to be less than 20 minutes for heavy-duty vehicles,” the company &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-awarded-u-s-department-of-energy-grant-128"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This project is expected to address this goal by working to develop an autonomous fueling system that can rapidly refuel heavy-duty fuel-cell electric trucks, while minimizing labor and challenges relating to ergonomics and maintenance of equipment, as compared to an equivalent manual fueling process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdsyJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction (August 13th, 3:xxPM ET):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this story said the grant was announced after Milton’s indictment two weeks ago. It was first announced &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/hydrogen-and-fuel-cells-rd-fy-2021-foa-selections"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on July 7th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by the Department of Energy. The Verge regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is pausing its verification program again, after giving fake accounts blue checks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8fEvYvpDPIMP6vWxTlFU7D5Qkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722843/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gTlpAf"&gt;Twitter is once again putting a halt on applications to its verification program, saying that it needs to work on the application and review process that lets people into the blue check mark club. This change is coming after Twitter admitted that several fake accounts, which reportedly seemed to be part of a botnet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;were incorrectly verified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FcbAJ"&gt;If you’ve recently applied for verification, there is a chance you’ll get it — Twitter Verified has said that it’ll &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426227102957907968?s=20"&gt;still be reviewing existing applications&lt;/a&gt;, so the freeze is just preventing new people from being able to apply. Twitter hasn’t indicated that it’ll be making changes to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;the criteria that it uses to deem accounts as verifiable or not&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B18jY4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve temporarily hit pause on rolling out access to apply for Verification so we can make improvements to the application and review process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those who have been waiting, we know this may be disappointing. We want to get things right, and appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Verified (@verified) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EIT3Ly"&gt;This isn’t the first time Twitter has paused its verification program — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;put the public process on hold in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, after it received backlash for verifying one of the organizers behind the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville. It brought back a revamped version in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;and paused it a week later&lt;/a&gt; due to an avalanche of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tlHHZ"&gt;The start-stop issues Twitter has been having with its Verified program speak to the difficulties that can come with issuing a badge that is sometimes regarded by users as an endorsement. Twitter says that the purpose of the badge is to show that an account is “authentic, notable, and active,&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;but even those criteria can end up courting controversy when people who are arguably notable get their applications rejected (especially when obviously fake accounts make it through). &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHR0U7"&gt;Sonos might be developing a voice assistant alternative to Alexa or Google Assistant for its speakers, according to &lt;a href="https://voicebot.ai/2021/08/10/sonos-surveys-users-about-potential-voice-assistant/"&gt;a customer survey spotted by &lt;em&gt;VoiceBot.ai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The survey, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/p17y3y/sonos_acquisition_of_snips/h8c0taz?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;a Sonos customer on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, describes an on-device voice control system that would improve user privacy by &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; routing questions and commands through the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I1av7"&gt;In the survey (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/g0652ei?nc=1"&gt;pictured below&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Reddit user EdmundFitzgerald29), Sonos writes that its “potential new product offering” would use the wake word “Hey Sonos” and let users control playback, search through songs, and move music to other speakers with their voice. The survey claims that the assistant can respond faster because it would be processing everything on device, rather than relying on an internet connection and sending queries to a server.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonos’ survey asking for customer input on a new voice control system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2qIp55"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked for comment on whether the survey was real, Sonos said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8XlL9E"&gt;We regularly put product and experience concepts in front of our customers to better understand what is important to them. We don’t have anything further to share at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HM3Yd7"&gt;There’s some reason to believe Sonos would work on a project like this. Sonos acquired its own AI voice-platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975607/sonos-buys-snips-ai-voice-assistant-privacy"&gt;in the form of Snips in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Snips’ privacy-focused tech — notably doing all processing on device — sounds a lot like the feature Sonos is now reportedly pitching to customers. Sonos also has a reason to want to provide an independent voice solution — it’s had a public falling out with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18174686/sonos-google-assistant-beam-one-beta-demo-features-ces-2019"&gt;one of its voice control partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMfFXe"&gt;Sonos claims Google stole some of its multiroom audio tech during a Google Music partnership in 2013. The company apparently warned Google that it was infringing on patents during multiple Google Chromecast and Home speaker launches, but Google didn’t listen. Now the conflict is playing out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; started by Sonos in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mv7aC"&gt;It’s not clear when or if Sonos plans to introduce its own voice control system, but based on the survey, which highlights compatibility with Amazon’s Alexa and not Google Assistant, it seems like Sonos would like Google to take less of a central role.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Immunocompromised people should get a third COVID-19 vaccine dose, CDC committee says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZKF36"&gt;Immunocompromised people should get a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee recommended today.  After taking only a standard, two-dose series of the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, patients may not generate enough antibodies against the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rNzaz"&gt;“I have known of patients who are immunocompromised and in the hospital, they did all the right things. They’re just suffering from a lack of good vaccine protection,” says Camille Kotton, clinical director of transplant and immunocompromised host infectious diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital, during the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="IzKsXs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4yvST"&gt;The decision follows the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620757/booster-covid-vaccine-immunocompromised-fda"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday night that it has amended the emergency use authorization for both vaccines to allow the additional third shot for people who have received solid organ transplants or who have conditions that impair the immune system to a similar degree. There are no changes for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one-shot vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AH2Nzp"&gt;Around 7 million adults in the United States are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-13/02-COVID-Dooling-508.pdf"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;. They’re more likely to get seriously ill from COVID-19, are more likely to have breakthrough infections even if vaccinated, and the vaccines aren’t as effective for them. People considered moderately or severely immunocompromised &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-13/03-COVID-Goswami-508.pdf"&gt;include people&lt;/a&gt; who have received organ transplants, in treatment for some cancers, and who take immunosuppressive medications like high-dose corticosteroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgOwEz"&gt;Immunocompromised people shouldn’t need a doctor’s note or prescription to get a third dose, says Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer at the CDC. “This is self-attesting,” she told attendees at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="List of immunosuppressive conditions that could qualify for a third dose. Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, receipt of solid-organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy, receipt of CAR-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy), moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency, advanced or untreated HIV infection, active treatment with biologic agents that are immunosuppressive" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgKzQ_0qW-qxgsqOTPEZgtKDeDc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780870/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_12.31.05_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A presentation at the ACIP meeting lists the conditions that could qualify for a third dose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O9OAX8"&gt;A third shot increases the proportion of immunocompromised people who produce antibodies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s still not clear if or how much that antibody boost translates to prevention of COVID-19 for this group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7TdBw"&gt;Even with a third dose, people who are immunocompromised should still take precautions against COVID-19. While the boost will likely give them some additional protection, they’d still be at high risk for a severe case of COVID-19 should they contract the disease. “Immunocompromised people should continue to wear a mask, stay six feet apart from others they don’t live with, and avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces,” Dooling says.&lt;/p&gt;
