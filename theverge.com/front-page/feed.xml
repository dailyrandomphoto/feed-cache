    <title>Instagram’s link stickers are rolling out to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8gN_hpooJKLMGZzt-nKZFqXAu8=/0x1:1619x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051991/Link_Sticker.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stickers appear in Stories posts, and can link out to external sites.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9sdHS"&gt;Instagram’s link stickers, which let you include hyperlinks in Stories in the form of stickers, will now be available to everyone on the platform, the Facebook-owned social media network has announced. Instagram started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"&gt;testing link stickers in June&lt;/a&gt;, but until now the feature has been limited to verified accounts or accounts with a large number of followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eBiZL"&gt;According to the social network, link stickers are useful for anyone from businesses linking out to their products to activists linking out to external resources. But Instagram concedes that anyone can benefit from link sharing to engage with their followers. It also says that accounts repeatedly sharing misinformation or hate speech will lose access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MJpYtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The successor to the swipe up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbVmX4"&gt;To add a link, head into the sticker tool from the top navigation bar after uploading content to your story, tap the “Link” sticker and enter the desired URL. It then functions like any other sticker on a Stories post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuBMW5"&gt;When it announced the link stickers feature in June, Instagram stressed that they’re only meant for Stories posts and said it had no plans to bring them to the main Instagram feed or other parts of the app. That remains the status quo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NkM9L"&gt;The link stickers feature has now entirely replaced “swipe up,” which was how Instagram users could previously link out to external webpages from their Stories, and which the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638222/instagram-swipe-up-link-sticker-roll-out"&gt;discontinued in August&lt;/a&gt;. But with today’s news, link stickers are now more widely available than swipe up ever was, since the old feature was only available to verified accounts or accounts with more than 10,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Frame TV is $300 off at Best Buy and Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DERJFJYLB90n_s7VXEWdkTl4EKg=/0x405:4194x3201/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051724/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a limited time, Samsung’s 55-inch, art-inspired QLED is down to $998, its best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3bphup"&gt;Nobody will deny the unique appeal of the Samsung Frame TV, which you can currently find at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $300 off its original MSRP. While the price is a bit steep for a 55-inch 4K TV, you’re really paying for the aesthetics and the QLED panel. When removed from its stand, the Frame TV is virtually indistinguishable from a framed piece of artwork on the wall, even going so far as to include an ambient art mode that’s designed to transform the HDR TV into a piece of decor rather than a passive appliance. The 2021 model offers some impressive specs as well, including support for Amazon’s Alexa, four HDMI ports, a 120Hz refresh rate, and the Tizen smart platform, which enables access to most major streaming services without the need for a Roku or other streaming device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdDmER"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAZ45N"&gt;The Logitech G903 Hero, one of the best gaming mice on the market, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Rechargeable-Compatible-Ambidextrous/dp/B07NSVMT22?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to just $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching its best price to date. Sporting a 25K DPI sensor and a customizable layout allowing for up to 11 programmable buttons, this ambidextrous mouse left very little on the cutting room floor in terms of features. It features remarkable battery life but is also compatible with the Logitech Powerplay system, allowing you to wirelessly charge it using either the Powerplay mat or a third-party magnetic dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f3WAgd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="MiDpfq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752982"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82lWMb"&gt;The original entry in the Microsoft Surface line of laptops has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just drop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ped to $550 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. One of our biggest issues with this laptop when we originally reviewed it was the steep price point for otherwise underwhelming specs. This deal, however, makes the Surface Laptop Go far more palatable. While far from cutting-edge, this laptop can still hold its own with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU and integrated UHD graphics. This configuration comes equipped with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but this discount also extends to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSmp2trFHm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; which has been reduced to $700. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21512680/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mwKhl7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuVWfv"&gt;Another excellent OLED deal from Vizio, the 55-inch version of the H1 series is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $1,000 at Best &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;. A 4K panel paired with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the H1 great for gaming, and the SmartCast platform grants access to most streaming services while HDR10 Plus compatibility offers an incredibly vivid picture. For connectivity, the H1 series includes a total of four HDMI 2.1 ports and a single USB port for powering external devices like a Roku Streaming Stick 4K. This particular model even includes composite video and optical audio inputs, and it supports AirPlay 2 alongside virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1XSJsJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9549851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTT7ef"&gt;If your PlayStation 5 is already running out of space, the 1TB version of the WD Black SN750 is currently available for $120 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;uy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-SN750-NVMe-Internal-Gaming/dp/B07M64QXMN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, half off its original MSRP. This M.2 SSD offers solid transfer speeds at 3,470MB/s, which helps cut down on load times, and the compact form factor makes for simple installation whether you need the extra storage on a PC or console. If you’re planning on upgrading the storage on your PS5, however, keep in mind that you’ll also need to install your own heatsink alongside the SN750.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xz2aZO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"},{"title":"The PS5 SSD buying guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vxQC8J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlhLOb"&gt;A battery pack, charger, and adapter, the Anker PowerCore Fusion is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CPGM7TH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for an all-time low of $25 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with the promo code &lt;strong&gt;ANKR1622J21&lt;/strong&gt;. Our reviewer, Dieter Bohn, liked the sturdy design and how it consolidated the number of gadgets he needed to tote around. This battery pack shares a similar size to Apple’s 87-watt adapter and has both USB-A and USB-C ports to access the 5,000mAh battery. Just beware of the comparably low 30-watt limit on this charger, which isn’t sufficient to provide enough juice for more powerful portables like the MacBook Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306269/anker-powercore-fusion-usb-c-power-delivery-battery-charger-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMJejQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10658582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wzbLrC"&gt;We’re not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3araDp"&gt;The PS5 version of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, the first game to make &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Andrew Webster risk his life for an audio log, is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F303537.html%3Futm_source%3Drakutenls%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3DGameSpot%26utm_campaign%3D10%26utm_kxconfid%3Dtebx5rmj3%26cid%3Dafl_10000087%26affID%3D77777%26sourceID%3DVZfI20jEa0c-EquovOwsU9XX63SrecT3mw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $40 at Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The US Copyright Office just struck a blow for the right to repair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broken cracked iphone stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wrlVUxbfadBkKWD8up9DYus7LrY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051675/cracked-iphone-stock-1198.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CuI6wW"&gt;The US Copyright Office is expanding a legal shield for fixing digital devices, including cars and medical devices. This morning, the office submitted &lt;a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/copyright/1201/2021/2021_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf"&gt;new exemptions to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, which bars breaking software copy protection. The resulting rules include a revamped section on device repair, reflecting renewed government pressure around “right to repair” issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojr0O0"&gt;The Register of Copyrights recommends &lt;a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2021/"&gt;Section 1201 “anti-circumvention” exemptions&lt;/a&gt; every three years, a process that has offered legal protections for everything from unlocking cellphones to ripping DVD clips for classroom use. In addition to renewing these and several other exemptions, this latest rulemaking adopts repair-related proposals from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, iFixit, and other organizations. The Librarian of Congress  adopted the recommendations in a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf"&gt;final rule&lt;/a&gt; that will take effect tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmalw9"&gt;The exemptions replace an itemized list of repairable devices with broad protections for any consumer devices that rely on software to function, as well as land and sea vehicles and medical devices that aren’t consumer-focused. The rulemaking doesn’t rewrite the exemption to cover all &lt;em&gt;non-&lt;/em&gt;consumer devices, and it doesn’t cover all “modification,” only “diagnosis, maintenance, and repair.” For video game consoles specifically, repair only covers repairing the device’s optical drives and requires reenabling any technological protection measures that were circumvented afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jlb0xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Repair organizations have been pushing exemptions for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezkjWc"&gt;“The petitioners did a good job of showing commonalities across different types of devices,” said Acting General Counsel Kevin Amer on a phone call with reporters. “We also are aware of some of the efforts that the executive branch has undertaken in this area,” including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order from the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; supporting third-party and consumer repair work. “We do think that this exemption will be useful and will help to facilitate that type of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma0jov"&gt;Other agencies — as well as state and federal lawmakers — have their own right to repair policies on the table. The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;pledged to fight business practices&lt;/a&gt; that lock out independent repair shops. This copyright rulemaking doesn’t address those practices, but it helps lift a legal threat hanging over technicians and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ibbHG"&gt;Right to repair expansion sits alongside several other changes. The Copyright Office nixed some requests to expand an exemption for reproducing clips of movies and TV shows, for instance, but it supplemented the categories of people who can do this for educational use, covering education staff beyond faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LxeMo"&gt;The rule extends exemptions for converting video to accessible formats for people with disabilities, letting educators add subtitles or audio captions before someone requests an accessible version as long as they reasonably expect it will be needed. Video game players with disabilities can also circumvent systems that prevent them from using nonstandard input devices on computers, although the exemptions don’t add some broader requested accessibility protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W6BD6Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Copyright Office also updated exemptions for accessibility and medical data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbxVpQ"&gt;Meanwhile, archival libraries should be able to create copies of deteriorating disc-based media if they can’t find a replacement copy elsewhere. (The office rejected requests that people be able to break copy protection to shift media into different formats, however.) The report expands the language of an exemption for security researchers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUvvL"&gt;The new policy loosens &lt;a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2015/10/27/dmca-exception-granted-for-medical-device-research-patient-access-to-data/"&gt;a 2015 exemption&lt;/a&gt; granting access to medical device data, rewording it to cover devices that aren’t implanted and letting patients authorize third parties to access it, although some methods of access could still violate liability laws. It also grants jailbreaking exceptions for video streaming devices like the Apple TV and for routers and other networking hardware, as long as it’s not done to access pirated media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mH42Hx"&gt;Section 1201 remains a controversial (and, some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/digital-millennium-copyright-act-eff-supreme-court"&gt;critics contend,&lt;/a&gt; unconstitutional) piece of the DMCA. It’s intended to prevent breaking digital rights management software that protects copyrighted media, but as software becomes an increasingly important part of basic consumer devices, it’s cast a legal pall over myriad non-piracy-related activity. The renewal cycle also means that educators, security researchers, repair technicians, and others will go through this process again in a few years — but for now, they’ve seen some welcome changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new TVs will soon support Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6nn16Ht5TdjOu74_4qjvsD-Ztnw=/183x0:2430x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051650/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_7.38.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RuB2k"&gt;Amazon is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"&gt;making its own TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today marks the release of the company’s Omni and 4-Series Fire TVs. As the 4K HDR sets start making their way to customers, Amazon is making one more last-minute announcement: it plans to add support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit features “soon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAFoJJ"&gt;AirPlay 2 makes it easy to play content on the TV screen from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And HomeKit integration will allow the Omni and 4-Series TVs to be controlled by Siri or the Home app; it also makes it easy to include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGUV78"&gt;Amazon has already rolled out AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;some of its “Fire TV Edition” TVs from Toshiba and Insignia&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously, these features have yet to come to the company’s standalone Fire TV streaming devices — including the just-released Fire TV Stick 4K Max. I’m not sure if that’s an intentional choice, but it’s a bit odd that Amazon is ready to announce support on day one for its brand-new TVs with nothing to share about AirPlay 2 coming to its cheaper devices. (Roku supports AirPlay 2 on both its players and Roku TVs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpXQrx"&gt;The Fire TV Omni series TVs offer the better picture quality of the two lines and come with built-in far-field microphones for hands-free Alexa voice commands. The 65-inch and 75-inch models support Dolby Vision HDR, though there are also smaller 43-, 50-, and 55-inch sizes available with HDR10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0D51s"&gt;Stay tuned for our impressions of Amazon’s first self-branded 4K TVs in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new regular AirPods get a lot right even before the gimmicky spatial audio part&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYTlYX"&gt;For the first time since their introduction in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have a completely new design. The third-generation AirPods, priced at $179, bear a much closer resemblance to the AirPods Pro than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;long-stemmed original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-gen pairs&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has upgraded their sound, added new features like spatial audio head tracking, made them more durable with IPX4 water resistance, and lengthened their battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFDLaT"&gt;What remains unchanged about the AirPods is their ease of use and deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. If you’re living in Apple’s world, you still get exclusive features like the intuitive, just-hold-them-near-your-iPhone setup, audio sharing, automatic device switching, and other software tricks that have helped the AirPods stay atop the true wireless earbuds market by a wide margin. The third-generation AirPods also gain more extensive Find My support to help you locate them if they go missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup0oN"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max didn’t even exist the last time Apple refreshed its standard AirPods. So the third-gen earbuds also establish more feature parity across the entire lineup. There are definitely still reasons to pick those products instead — active noise cancellation, namely — but anyone who’s ready to upgrade their original AirPods will find a lot to like with the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWOCkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10826364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="444ptP"&gt;These AirPods basically look like the AirPods Pro with their ear tips chopped off. They share similar contours, especially now that Apple has shortened the stems by 33 percent. There are also grilled black speakers, mics, and vents around each earbud. These hardware elements have become so prominent that I’m surprised Apple isn’t offering the new AirPods in black to help camouflage them. But nope: they still only come in white. Since their design is now so similar, Apple carried over the “force sensor” controls from the AirPods Pro, with an indent on each stem that designates where to press. The tap gestures from the old AirPods are gone. Apple’s non-remappable controls handle media playback, and you can summon Siri with a long press. But you’ve also got hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands at your disposal for adjusting volume or changing up the playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfbDUX"&gt;Unlike the Pros, there are no silicone ear tips for a customizable fit: as with its previous standard AirPods, Apple sticks with a one-size-fits-most hard plastic design. They’re open-style earbuds that rest in your ears instead of extending deep into the ear canal. A lot of people love the barely there comfort of the AirPods. The main side effect of their open design is that they let in a ton of outside noise. For me, that’s always been a significant turnoff. But again, others value having the added awareness — be it for personal safety reasons or otherwise — and view this as an upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOF4UNksPfsgjJRt-H2qZmI9HNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953794/IMG_0048_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods (below) are clearly cut from the same cloth as the AirPods Pro (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="die3Jr"&gt;Unfortunately, fit is where the old AirPods have always let me down. They just weren’t a good match for my large-ish ears and would come loose and fall out way too easily. All ears are different, and I know a ton of people who had no such issues. But I was expecting another round of disappointment when I put the third-gen AirPods into my ears for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBcM1"&gt;Fortunately, the new shape fits my ears much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVPQU"&gt;Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They’re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I’m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple’s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it’s worth giving these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woYRg7Y4GOzAoeIkIMHF92IN-90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953799/IMG_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods have much shorter stems than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBojuP"&gt;The charging case now opens in landscape — just like the case for the AirPods Pro — but it’s noticeably smaller than that one. It’s closer in overall size to the original AirPods case, though a smidge thicker. The case still has a Lightning port for wired charging, and it also supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers. Apple says the new AirPods case is designed to work with the company’s MagSafe chargers. And sure enough, it grabs onto the circular MagSafe charging pad with the same perfect alignment as an iPhone 12 or 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nISprs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the old AirPods never fit your ears, these might do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8V0LTd"&gt;But don’t expect to charge your earbuds by placing them on the back of Apple’s MagSafe-ready iPhones: there’s no reverse wireless charging. And to drive that point home, Apple told me it intentionally designed the AirPods case so that it doesn’t magnetically latch onto the back of those phones. You’ll feel some pull when sliding the case around the back of the phone, but it’s nowhere near enough force to keep the two attached. As for the actual battery life, Apple says the third-gen AirPods can hit six hours of continuous playback and a total of 30 hours counting case recharges. That’s a modest improvement over the five hours and “over 24 hours” estimates from the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiGbOD"&gt;Both the AirPods and their case are now rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Plenty of people used the older generations for workouts, but the official certification gives added peace of mind if you’ll frequently be using these AirPods as a gym companion. There’s also a new “skin detection sensor” on each earbud that replaces the old IR sensor. It still tells the AirPods to pause when removed from your ears (or resume when placed back in), but Apple says this sensor can tell the difference between your ears or tight spaces like a pants pocket that might’ve fooled the previous AirPods into resuming playback if you put them in there without the case. It’s not difficult to envision future evolutions of this sensor tying into Apple’s health and fitness efforts. But for now it’s just there to make auto-pause more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFY7Ex"&gt;Apple has completely redesigned the acoustic driver and amplifier in the third-gen AirPods. The company told me it aimed to give them a sound profile similar to the AirPods Pro. There’s only so much you can do with open-style earbuds to improve bass performance; these will never pack the same low-end punch as many upscale in-ear buds. But the new AirPods do sound noticeably fuller and more dynamic than their predecessors — and yes, very similar to the Pros. In the right ways, they still sound like AirPods, and they’re tuned to work equally well for music, watching videos, podcasts, games, and so on. But Apple says music is still far and away the leading thing people use their AirPods for, so it’s trying to deliver the best audio quality possible in this form factor. I’ve found that the open design often leads to a more spacious soundstage. The AirPods are still handily outperformed by top-tier earbuds like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but among other buds with an open design, they’re up there with the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK-mSuFuVOg5iUNkHQdRI1SwPYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953803/IMG_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods have redesigned drivers and support spatial audio with head tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lfClhR"&gt;To further enhance their sound, the new AirPods use the same adaptive EQ feature as the Pros and Max. There’s an inward-facing mic on each earbud that analyzes what you’re hearing and, so Apple claims, adjusts the output in real time to what’s best for your unique ear shape. But the thing about adaptive EQ is that it’s impossible to ever really know when it’s doing something — or what that something is. It’s invisible to the listener at all times, so there’s not much to say about it. There’s no telling whether the improved sound is due to the redesigned drivers, the inclusion of adaptive EQ, or a combination of both. The third-gen AirPods do a better job of steering audio into your ears, which also helps achieve that full-bodied sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPpQJ6"&gt;But that brings us to the big trick Apple is advertising with the new AirPods: spatial audio with head tracking. Like the AirPods Pro and Max, the third-gen pair can dynamically adjust the sound in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side, keeping the sound source anchored to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV you’re watching. When you’re watching movies in Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, or other popular apps, this head tracking can be an immersive, fun experience and mimics surround sound better than a regular stereo mix would. It really does add to the satisfaction of watching movies on my iPad Pro. And for those times when someone’s asleep at home and you can’t take advantage of your soundbar or surround system on the Apple TV, you can listen in private with AirPods and spatial audio head tracking. Apple has also thought of other use cases: on group FaceTime calls, spatial audio creates a sound field that places the voices where they’re positioned on your device’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HUXc0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still in the early days of spatial audio — and you can tell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="683JZk"&gt;But when it comes to music, it all feels far more gimmicky. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;I’ve written about Apple Music’s Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; before, and everything there applies here. The feature works with all headphones, but only the third-gen AirPods, Pros, and Max add head tracking to the equation. That doesn’t really change where I stand on it. Spatial audio mixes can often sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts. It takes a lot of work from engineers and producers to get the most from Atmos, and it remains obvious that a lot of albums available in spatial audio on Apple Music haven’t gotten that level of attention. Instruments and effects can sound out of place, vocals can get drowned out in the mix, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1oiF2"&gt;The situation is improving as newer records are mixed for Atmos from the get-go. (And Atmos mixes do generally sound a lot better on actual Atmos home theater systems.) The recent Giles Martin remix of &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt; by The Beatles takes advantage of spatial audio well without trying to do too much. It has that feeling of being in the room with the band. But other examples, like Kacey Musgraves’ &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, don’t do anything for me that I don’t already get from the stereo version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrGfV"&gt;In short, spatial audio can wow when it comes to video, but we’re still in the very early stages of the music side — and it’s not a reason to buy these earbuds yet. Apple makes it easy to switch back and forth between spatial audio and regular sound in Control Center. And iOS 15 actually lets you “spatialize” sound from apps like Spotify that don’t otherwise offer the feature. I guess that’s nice to have if you really find yourself loving this new way of listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W73EEHXIiB114uTu-QbiD6XBZUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like all AirPods before them, the third-gen earbuds are positioned as the perfect iPhone accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGJmS"&gt;The AirPods have long been the champion of voice calls, and with the third-gen set, Apple is trying to improve the fidelity of FaceTime calls by using a new AAC-ELD codec for clearer voice reproduction. There’s also acoustic mesh on the outward-facing side of each AirPod that’s meant to reduce wind noise. Despite the shorter stems, overall microphone performance remains excellent and the new AirPods remain easy to recommend if you want earbuds that guarantee you’ll come through clearly on calls. Stay tuned for our video review for the full mic test — with Becca, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1Vctld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10826383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Oafy"&gt;Apple has also given the new AirPods a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;deeper level of integration with its Find My app&lt;/a&gt;. You could always play a sound to find a missing (nearby) earbud or see the location where they were last connected to your phone. But now the third-gen AirPods get the same “find nearby” feature as the AirPods Pro and Max. This is an AirTags-like interface for pinpointing where the AirPods are if you’re in close proximity to them. It’s not as accurate as an AirTag, but the UI will tell you when the AirPods are “nearby” and then show “here” when you’re right near them. If they’re really nowhere to be found, you can also now enable lost mode and be alerted if your missing AirPods come within range of millions of other iOS devices. My favorite of the new Find My features are the separation alerts that automatically pop up if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. That alone should prevent a lot of heartbreak and lost earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aimgs"&gt;The new AirPods are the first big redesign of Apple’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. From a fit and comfort standpoint, I think Apple succeeded: these are still wonderfully lightweight earbuds, and they actually stay in my ears now. The sound quality has seen some refinement, and the third-gen AirPods are a better gym buddy than their predecessors. Plus you’ve got longer battery life and nice-to-have features like spatial audio head tracking — even if Apple is overselling it a bit. I’ll personally be sticking with the AirPods Pro and other earbuds that offer noise cancellation or at least some isolation. But if you prefer the open-style AirPods and have an older pair that can’t hold a charge anymore, these are a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Y3dZlM"&gt;But before you go getting locked deeper into Apple’s ecosystem, it’s worth exploring your options. The game has changed a lot since the second-gen AirPods were released, and it’s possible to find better sound quality among competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and others. If you can do without the frills, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;spend much less and still be happy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’ve got an iPhone, none of those can deliver the same seamless experience as the AirPods. They’re still designed to perfectly complement Apple’s smartphone, and in that regard they don’t disappoint. Perhaps more than any other Apple product today, AirPods still just work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hinge adds voice notes and voice prompts to dating profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgAGOlGuswUoUVP9iqnZO04hUMw=/12x0:2036x1349/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051480/Hinge_Voice_Prompts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WJUWB"&gt;Dating app Hinge is adding new audio features, letting users answer the “getting to know you” prompts on their profile using audio clips and exchange voice notes in chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82pFAg"&gt;The new features will roll out Wednesday globally and are the latest example of apps using voice to add a new dimension to digital dating. Rival services like Bumble and Happn have already added voice notes to their app, and one app, String, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; lets users &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/sex-and-relationships/string-new-dating-app-710735"&gt;communicate with their voice&lt;/a&gt;. For many people, the sound of someone’s voice can be an important part of attraction, and exchanging voice notes is a more expressive way to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3TJ0K6MqT2LB_hb9992ruqyF8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956117/Hinge_Voice_Notes.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hinge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be able to exchange voice notes in chat. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cjNyRK"&gt;If users want to add a voice prompt to their profile, they should make sure the app is updated, then head to Settings &amp;gt; Edit Profile &amp;gt; Voice Prompt. You can record a voice note for any of Hinge’s regular prompts (questions like worst date stories and favorite random facts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhvpRr"&gt;“Hinge wants to help people get to know you as soon as they see your profile. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, imagine how many your voice is,” said Hinge’s chief product officer Michelle Parsons in a press release. “With the introduction of Voice Prompts, we’re adding more authenticity to the profile experience, allowing users to fully display their personality in a new way.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzIU2sWM9jTd-nqoUNbHC4KQRXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051450/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUpwvb"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pro notch is misbehaving. Early adopters have discovered inconsistencies in how Apple handles the notch across macOS and in individual apps, resulting in unexpected behavior where status bar items can get hidden under the notch. These inconsistencies make it feel like Apple has forgotten, in areas of macOS, that it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;built a notch into the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWuMbY"&gt;Snazzy Labs owner Quinn Nelson has posted two videos on Twitter demonstrating some of the early notch issues. The main video demonstrates what appears to be a bug in macOS. Status bar items like Apple’s battery indicator can get hidden underneath the notch when status bar items are extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NQyk9a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS?!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/ADVqmfdqV2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ADVqmfdqV2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuoITI"&gt;Nelson demonstrates this with iStat Menus, which can be hidden under the notch or can force system items like the battery indicator to be hidden underneath the notch. While Apple has issued guidance to developers on how to work with the notch, the developer behind iStat Menus says the app is just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bjango/status/1453171506263982087"&gt;using standard status items&lt;/a&gt; and that Apple’s dev guidance “won’t solve the issue presented in the video.” This doesn’t appear to be intended behavior, as the notch works differently inside certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTy9Dr"&gt;Nelson also highlights how an older version of DaVinci Resolve avoids the notch. In apps that haven’t been updated for the notch, you can’t even move your mouse pointer into it. Apple blocks off this space so that older apps can’t display menu items underneath the notch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-problem-status-items/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that this behavior is inconsistent across the rest of macOS, though, so if you have Finder in focus then the cursor can get lost behind the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYjzzm"&gt;The notch can also exacerbate existing macOS issues. Apps like DaVinci Resolve (with extended menu items) can take over the space used by system status items. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-menu-bar-behavior/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; this is regular macOS behavior, but that the notch obviously reduces the amount of space for both the menu items and status items. It’s an ongoing issue that has spawned apps like &lt;a href="https://www.macbartender.com/"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; to help manage the macOS menu bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fIN0Ud"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"},{"title":"Apple botched the MacBook Pro notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LuBPiE"&gt;It’s not clear how Apple will address these inconsistencies, even as developers update their regular apps to work around the notch. Thankfully, these problems will be extremely rare and will only likely appear in apps with lots of menu or status items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6ji0r"&gt;Either way, it’s odd this wasn’t a design consideration ahead of the MacBook Pro launch. As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1453145302836256771"&gt;Dieter Bohn puts it&lt;/a&gt;: “Soooo the team in charge of Menu Items in apps was read in on the notch, but the team in charge of Menu Status items was not? lol”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WZSfw"&gt;In other words, don’t blame app developers, it’s notch always gonna be their fault.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lightyear’s new trailer turns a cute toy into a sci-fi hero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwauFOwRe83ATlwa3ZhAQpO5zwM=/0x67:4096x2798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051391/LIGHTYEAR_ONLINE_USE_b030_38_pub.pub16.2145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PIXAR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stoxfp"&gt;Have you ever really wondered about Buzz Lightyear’s origin story? Not the action figure, which helped make &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; so beloved, but the actual space ranger? Well, Disney and Pixar sure are hoping so with the upcoming feature &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as “the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear” and the first trailer makes it look like a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-style sci-fi adventure, complete with cool spaceships and futuristic alien worlds. The movie even casts an action movie star, with Chris Evans handling Buzz’s voice. Angus MacLane, who co-directed &lt;em&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/em&gt;, is serving as director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxfJT2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; was actually first announced last year, but you’d be forgiven for forgetting about it: the reveal was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;a massive wave of more than 50 updates from Disney&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly marks a shift in tone for both Pixar and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Disney says the movie will be coming out on June 17th, 2022, though it’s not clear if it will be exclusive to theaters or available on Disney Plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI announces compact, modular, and magnetic Action 2 camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/071PhW5aKdiG-483cx9Uyb6t6t4=/399x23:1573x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051273/DJI_Action_2_KV___Studio_05__Front_touchscreen_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yPkdh6"&gt;DJI has announced a follow-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20751772/dji-osmo-action-camera-gopro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;its Osmo Action camera&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s got a completely new design — the Action 2 drops the Osmo name and focuses on modularity with a suite of additional parts and accessories that attach to the camera magnetically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv5eV7"&gt;The camera module itself is small (it's 39mm square and 22mm deep) and includes a 12MP sensor capable of 4K recording, a lens that provides a 155-degree field of view, and a 1.76-inch OLED touchscreen covered by Gorilla Glass. Using magnets, you can attach another touchscreen (which also boosts the battery life and adds an array of microphones), an extra battery, or a variety of mounts that let you attach it to tripods or GoPro mounts, or even wear the camera as a necklace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muAws1fM7O7lhhVH_TZ77UWUsCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954848/DJI_Action_2___Power_Module__back_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modules, like the one that adds extra battery power, attach with both magnets and physical clips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T8eDmf"&gt;Speaking of GoPro, any action cam is going to face comparisons, and the Action 2’s specs fall short when put side by side with those of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;the recent Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;: it can do 4K at 120 frames per second like the Hero10 but lacks any higher-resolution options (the Hero10 can do 5.3K60), and its 240fps super slow-motion runs at 1080p instead of the GoPro’s 2.7K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6bhzA"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that the Action 2 is &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; in comparison — it weighs just 53 grams, which is almost exactly a third the weight of the Hero10. DJI also includes 32GB of built-in storage (expandable with a microSD card), something the GoPro lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbzL8q"&gt;There’s also the system of magnetic accessories DJI is working on, which lets you customize your camera in a way that’s not really possible with the GoPro. If you need a second screen or more battery, you can just snap them on — and then take them off when you want a compact or discreet camera. Other accessories, like a headband or magnetic ball-mount adapter that can be attached to tripods, are similar to GoPro accessories but will (in theory) be easier to attach to and detach from the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhLIOxY8OyUT8qEVXVoasWo8dME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954849/DJI_Action_2___Camera_Unit___Front_Touchscreen_Module__back_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Action 2 has a touchscreen on the back, and the front screen module lets you add another one, as well as augmenting the camera’s single microphone with three others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQFXUf"&gt;The Action 2 also has action cam table-stakes features like electronic stabilization, horizon leveling, and the ability to livestream or be used as a webcam, as well as some neat tricks like a color temperature sensor that DJI says will help produce better colors in complicated lighting situations or underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilyFmF"&gt;Comparing the Action 2’s price with GoPro’s isn’t straightforward, due to GoPro’s pricing model and the DJI’s modularity. You can get the Hero10 for $400, but that requires having a $50-a-year subscription — otherwise, the camera is $500. The Action 2 power bundle costs $399 and includes the camera, power module (which extends your record time to 180 minutes versus the camera’s 70 and adds an extra microSD card slot), a mount, and a lanyard. DJI tells me you can’t buy the camera by itself, which seems like a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjFKBN"&gt;If you want to replicate the Hero10’s built-in front-facing screen, you’ll have to go for the $519 dual-screen bundle, which includes the same things as the power bundle (but swaps out the battery module with the screen one) and adds a ball-joint adapter as well. While that’s technically more than the GoPro’s non-subscriber asking price, the Hero10’s lack of built-in storage means that you’d probably make up the price difference buying a microSD card anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FH7JUD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="DJI Action Cam 2|104515" data-volume-uuid="77a6c6aa5" data-volume-id="104515" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-616" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ZquG"&gt;DJI says that the dual-screen bundle will be coming on November 2nd, and the power combo, along with most other accessories, will be coming in “mid-November.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is my Alexa flashing green, red, orange, and yellow?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Wr_Bs7JZBoIDYkC8N8yzcnu-KA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051319/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your Echo speaker is flashing, Alexa is either listening or trying to tell you something.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IBNLLC"&gt;You’ve got one of Amazon’s Echo smart speakers set up and it’s super handy for playing music, checking the weather, setting an egg timer — all hands-free. But then it starts flashing different colors at random times: red, green, yellow, orange... it’s almost like it’s trying to communicate with you. Which, in fact, it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQbVIZ"&gt;When your Echo speaker is flashing its LED at you, there is a really easy way to figure out what it wants. Just say, “Alexa, what does your light mean?” But that would be a really short blog. So, for those of us who don’t like talking to our smart speakers, I’ve made this quick cheat sheet to explain what all those flashing lights mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JQtIY"&gt;The LED light is Alexa’s status and notification indicator. Depending on which device you have, the LED light will be in a different location. For example, on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;new Echo&lt;/a&gt; and Echo Dot, it’s a ring at the bottom; on the Echo Studio, it’s a ring up top; and on the Echo Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;smart displays&lt;/a&gt;, it appears as a line on the bottom of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZxsu8"&gt;Wherever it’s situated, most of the time it’s hanging out doing nothing. But when you see it pulsing, circling, or swirling, Alexa is either listening to you or trying to tell you something. Here’s what it wants you to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nteD6p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEBJfP"&gt;A slow yellow “burst” every few seconds means your Alexa voice assistant has something to tell you. Ask, “Alexa, what are my notifications? Or “Alexa, what are my messages?” and all will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdmng"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing blue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wkBMKJ"&gt;A cyan spotlight on a blue ring means Alexa heard you — the cyan spotlight will actually point in the direction it heard your voice. It will then spin as it processes your request. If it’s spinning while you’re not talking to it, it means the device is starting up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vox4qKFfg95XIGT4cIJqbQl0ufo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989899/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cyan blue point on a blue light ring shows that the Echo smart speaker is listening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6DFHeT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZhNHc"&gt;If the ring is solid red, it means the speaker’s microphone is muted and can’t hear you. Hit the unmute button to open up those mics again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WL0zFQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JRDVn9"&gt;A swirling orange light means the Echo speaker is in setup mode or is trying to connect to the internet. An orange line on a smart display like an Echo Show means it’s trying to connect to the internet but is currently offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MkYzPP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nkt8he"&gt;Pulsing green on an Echo tells you someone is calling you. It should be accompanied by an announcement of who is calling. Say “Alexa, answer” to connect to the call (assuming you want to answer it). While on the call, the green light starts spinning until the call ends. A spinning green light will also appear if you are in a “Drop-In” with another speaker on your network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JmTtMVEQ180G8pHq0-CKbBwUEMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641649/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LED light bar on the Echo Show smart displays will appear at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CpSFa2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing purple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tTQs8w"&gt;A purple ring or line means you’ve got Do Not Disturb enabled on the speaker. This blocks notifications, calls, and messages, but not alarms, timers, or reminders. It will flash purple when you ask it to do something. You can ask Alexa to turn Do Not Disturb off or do it manually in the Alexa app. If it goes purple while you are setting up the device, it couldn’t connect to Wi-Fi during setup (as opposed to &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to connect, which is represented by orange).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSwnat"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing white&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WTirRF"&gt;A white light moving up or down (or around) indicates you’re adjusting the volume either on the device or in the app. A spinning white light means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622968/alexa-guard-amazon-echo-security-how-to-get"&gt;Alexa Guard&lt;/a&gt; is turned on and set in Away Mode. You can go to the app and change it to Home Mode or say, “Alexa, I’m home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lsyc5G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to stop Alexa from flashing (as much)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0AieF1"&gt;If the constant flashing is bothering you (which is quite likely if you’re using the device as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727055/alexa-google-smart-speaker-alarm-clocks-backup-battery"&gt;smart alarm clock by your bed&lt;/a&gt;), you can turn off all but essential notifications: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5hbd1m"&gt;Go to the Alexa app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wqhwB2"&gt;Tap on More &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Device Settings &amp;gt; [your speaker name] &amp;gt; Communications &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KI9CR2"&gt;Toggle Communications off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0HFmZE"&gt;This will only stop the yellow and green rings from flashing — which are also the most likely to flash. But it will also disable Drop In and Announcements (where you can speak to one Echo in your house and every other one will relay the message), and it will still flash if there’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
