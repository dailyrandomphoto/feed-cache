    <title>Slack is down for some people, and of course, the problem is DNS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l02Kn6ZFJYCb7xP8bdvHkDoRZgE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69933251/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6lo71"&gt;Slack appears to be having issues for some people, with reports coming in of users who can’t connect to the service, receive errors when trying to send messages, and can’t &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackStatus/status/1443644374311649288?s=20"&gt;even access Slack’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The issue doesn’t appear to affect everyone, and Slack hasn’t gone as far as calling it an outage on &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com"&gt;its status page&lt;/a&gt;. The differences in experiences pointed to a possible routing issue or the even more likely culprit, &lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt; (it’s always DNS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VStAF1"&gt;At 3:50PM ET, &lt;a href="https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2021-September/021340.html"&gt;Slack confirmed&lt;/a&gt; what we suspected and what &lt;a href="https://lists.dns-oarc.net/pipermail/dns-operations/2021-September/021340.html"&gt;others had already figured out&lt;/a&gt; — it was DNS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Be4eVb"&gt;Some of my co-workers have had issues today, while it’s working fine for others (including, unfortunately, me). It’s unclear how widespread the issues are — DownDetector &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/slack/"&gt;only shows a thousand or so reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kRdq33"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're doing our best!&lt;/p&gt;— Slack (@SlackHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1443654557763051528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kFuY7"&gt;The company says it’s working on a fix for the issue, but &lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-09/06c1e17de93e7dc2"&gt;the incident report page&lt;/a&gt; says it’s been ongoing since around 12:30PM ET, or 9:30AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFqf7E"&gt;If you’re still having trouble connecting, then either &lt;a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Flush-DNS"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; or your ISP may need to flush your cached DNS information. One way to get connected if your ISP’s information hasn’t been updated is to use alternate DNS servers, like Google’s ( 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17191538/how-to-change-dns-routers-windows-mac-ios"&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QHOfMl"&gt;We are aware of connectivity issues related to DNS that are impacting a small subset of users. This issue was caused by our own change and not related to any third-party DNS software and services. In order to resolve this faster, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) will need to flush their DNS record for slack.com. Please reach out to your networking team to provide them with this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64rc5y"&gt;We expect all customers’ connectivity issues to be resolved within the next 24 hours. We know how important it is for people to stay connected and we apologize for this disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jlZu83"&gt;If all that fails, maybe it’s the universe telling you to take a walk or cook yourself something nice. When the chat app eventually comes back, it’ll probably do so in a bit of a wave — you can just tell your boss that it came back a little later for you and that you were really trying to message them about that draft, honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iS9LEl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our investigation of this connection issue is still ongoing at this time. We’ll be back with another update and apologize for this disruption. Thank you for your continued patience. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tZUb1TWDEc"&gt;https://t.co/tZUb1TWDEc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Slack Status (@SlackStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackStatus/status/1443656781230575635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>How to use Focus assist in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGPcB-hag5ziG8bREU7-h7I7cOY=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932976/Screenshot__52_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYNzSf"&gt;It’s all too easy to allow distractions such as social media or videos to seduce us from the things we’re supposed to be doing — such as, say, writing articles about Windows 11. Features such as Focus assist are now being included with operating systems to try to help us keep our eyes on the road, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeWhvf"&gt;Microsoft’s Focus assist was first introduced in a 2018 update of Windows 10, where it replaced a feature known as Quiet Hours, and while Windows 11 doesn’t offer any radical updates, it has made the feature easier to use. Focus assist stops notifications from popping up on your screen and can be activated automatically when you put on your display on presentation mode, are playing a game, or are using an app in full-screen mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkz6CD"&gt;I’ll show you how to edit the automatic sessions in a moment. First, here’s how to manually begin a Focus assist session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LTnVfe"&gt;Start a session&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SXQKyl"&gt;In Windows 11, Focus assist has been made a part of the Clock app. To start a session manually, type “Clock” into your taskbar’s Search icon. You’ll be guided to a page that helps you set up the length of time you want the session to last; you can also set a daily goal if you wish. And there are tiles that let you link your Spotify account (should you have one) to your focus sessions or use Microsoft To Do to pick a task for that session. Don’t need either of these? Keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now part of the Clock app, Focus assist lets you set goals for keeping on track." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yT8TO3-9CeinWol_0hKqVStWCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890585/Screenshot__54_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now part of the Clock app, Focus assist lets you set goals for keeping on track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="boy9gO"&gt;If you click on the settings icon at the bottom left of the Clock app, you can adjust the length of your focus time (including breaks) and select a sound to play when your focus period (or your break) ends. And you can get rid of the Spotify and / or To Do tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCq2ZS"&gt;The Clock settings page also lets you pick a theme for the app and tweak your notification settings, including which notifications should not be filtered out during a Focus assist session.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Clock settings page lets you edit your notifications settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bC_nl4YSLad-ohtZZ5LlqU7WL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890631/Screenshot__56_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Clock settings page lets you edit your notifications settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="filDrf"&gt;To personalize this feature a bit more and to edit the automatic settings, you need to go to “Focus assist settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C9SiKZ"&gt;Focus assist settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lQIBkH"&gt;You can get to Focus assist settings in several ways: by clicking on “Settings” &amp;gt; “System” &amp;gt; “Focus assist,” by using the taskbar search icon to find “Focus assist,” or by clicking on the system clock at the right edge of the taskbar and then on “Focus assist settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Within system settings, you can decide when you want Focus assist to activate, and for which notifications." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-vQP46U1hZ-IlfsO0PT-ZzJpzuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890745/Screenshot__49_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Within system settings, you can decide when you want Focus assist to activate, and for which notifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKJfQ5"&gt;Once you’re there, there are two main sections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znnux1"&gt;The first section lets you turn Focus assist on and off and set certain parameters when it is active:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZsSKqd"&gt;“Priority only” limits active notifications to those specified in a priority list. You can set that list up by selecting the “Customize priority list” link right below the “Priority only” subhead. You can have it always notify you of incoming calls, always notify you of reminders, or allow notifications from specific apps. New to Windows 11 is the ability to prioritize notifications from contacts who are either pinned to your taskbar or whom you specify via an “Add contacts” button.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can prioritize calls, reminders, apps, and specific contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vsj_NDeomzR9Tn_8ITRU3I2gQ8I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890748/Screenshot__47_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can prioritize calls, reminders, apps, and specific contacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="prjKxx"&gt;“Alarms only” lets you hide all your notifications, except for any alarms you may have set up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VjrrSb"&gt;Concerned that you may miss something? If you check “Show a summary of what I missed when focus assist was on,” then you will be automatically notified of all your filtered notifications as soon as Focus assist is no longer active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="trWFAb"&gt;The second section, headed “Automatic rules,” lets you adjust several pre-set rules. You can toggle each on and off from this page, but if you want to change their settings, click on the name of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="UoU9Za"&gt;“During these hours” lets you set specific times and days when Focus assist will kick in. To edit the settings, select “During these times” and then, on the next page, toggle it on. You’ll be able to choose the start and end times for each session; whether it applies to every day, to just weekdays or just weekends; and whether it will allow priority only or alarms only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can prioritize calls, reminders, apps, and specific contacts." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PoaXowXi7UtfmMMmWs7OdqXiCUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890749/Screenshot__57_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decide when you want Focus assist to kick in automatically.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wj0XAJ"&gt;The other features under “Automatic rules” operate in much the same way. On the Focus assist page, click the toggle to turn them on or off, and click on their name to adjust them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5FUd7k"&gt;“When I’m duplicating my display” kicks in when you’re got two displays going; toggle it on so you can edit it to allow either priority only or alarms only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MwMQSi"&gt;“When I’m playing a game” is pretty obvious; again, toggle it on to change it to priority only or alarms only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4IltbK"&gt;Finally, “When I’m using an app in full-screen mode only” can also be tweaked to be priority only or alarms only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ym1bI"&gt;One last thing: when Focus assist is active, you will see a small moon icon at the far right of your taskbar. Click on it, and you should be able to see any missed notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse finally lets you record conversations </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PpF8juBv0JuwMl5_qy5mP2eStPo=/0x0:5940x3960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932935/clubhouseclips.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bY1gYC"&gt;Clubhouse is getting a bunch of new features next month, including one many people have wanted: in-app recording. Starting in October, app users will be able to record a room, save it to their profile and club, or download it. Clubhouse is calling the feature “replays.” Creators and moderators are the ones who can record, and they can toggle that option on or off. Rooms must be public to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHtjwv"&gt;Along with full recordings, users will be able to create 30-second shareable clips in rooms that allow it. The app is also gaining a search feature so people can type a keyword or name and receive the rooms, people, clubs, and bios that match. Finally, spatial audio is also now coming to Android devices after rolling out to iOS devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648050/clubhouse-spatial-audio-3d-360-sound"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7lGbo"&gt;To create a clip, users can tap on a scissor icon that will capture the past 30 seconds of audio that can then be locally downloaded and shared widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlZSLrZmac1CT-5hMjFfs2k_mfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890496/Clips_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kke1dBaFNh1MmUPj0KYaboiC9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890505/Search_demo.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vV5zWn"&gt;I embedded a couple GIFs above to give you a better sense of how these features work, but broadly, they address some key issues Clubhouse has had: discovery and the desire to revisit conversations that already happened. Currently, the best way to promote a Clubhouse room is to tweet or post about it somewhere else. The clips tool might draw more people in and bring them to the app to hear the rest of an ongoing conversation. In-app search should also solve some of that as people hunt for rooms that might interest them, rather than relying on the algorithm to promote them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x96rC"&gt;This brings Clubhouse more up to speed with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterMedia/status/1405262233299345413?s=20"&gt;Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, which allows recording, as does Spotify’s competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535214/spotify-greenroom-locker-room-live-audio-app"&gt;Greenroom&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, these social audio platforms might end up becoming the place people record podcasts and other content in public, with the goal being to edit that content once a session is complete and distribute it more as a podcast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JGvkpN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple’s fortress of secrecy is crumbling from the inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQgpmeLeDb2phUsQM5iLRkfnRVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932920/acastro_210913_4747_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The last five months marked a turning point in Apple’s company culture — will it last?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="n53OkX"&gt;On June 14th, 2021, Apple’s remote work advocacy group sent an anonymous email to Tim Cook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR6Zrr"&gt;“We all agree that we are here at Apple to make insanely great products that enrich people’s lives and the world,” they wrote. “We are convinced that we can create the same, and even better products by adding more flexibility to the announced return to office policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUAH5O"&gt;Two weeks earlier, Cook had announced that after a difficult year working remotely, Apple was reopening its offices. Starting in September, employees would be asked to return to in-person work three days a week, with the option to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2MFRX"&gt;The news wasn’t surprising — Apple’s executive team had never pretended they wanted to go fully remote. But it didn’t sit well with staff members who’d moved away from Apple’s offices during the pandemic and had little desire to go back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uE0LFr"&gt;The tension might have stayed at a low simmer were it not for a Slack channel — #remote-work-advocacy — created in September 2020 to promote a more flexible working environment. By the summer of 2021, it had reached roughly 2,800 members, with conversations growing increasingly lively. After Cook made his announcement, employees knew they had to send a message. It was a small push back against management that would lay the groundwork for months of employee organizing and perhaps change the Apple workforce forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2QL9em"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not everyone is afraid that their boss at Apple is going to fire them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IVX1de"&gt;Apple’s remote work struggle is emblematic of a deeper shift taking place inside the company. Since 1976, the tech giant has operated in largely the same way: executives make decisions about how the company will function, and employees either fall in line or leave. What choice do they have? Apple is currently worth $2 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world, as well as one of the most powerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6bFWj"&gt;Over the past few months, however, that culture has started to erode. As workers across the tech industry advocate for more power, Apple’s top-down management seems more out of touch than ever before. Now, a growing number of employees are organizing internally for change and speaking out about working conditions on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZcNzI"&gt;“There’s a shift in the balance of power going on here,” says Jason Snell, the former editor of &lt;em&gt;Macworld, &lt;/em&gt;who’s been covering Apple since the 1990s. “Not everyone is afraid that their boss at Apple is going to fire them. They’re saying, ‘I’m going to say some bad things about Apple, and if you move against me, it’s going to look bad for you.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YkVDrp"&gt;The shift is due in part to the fact that the tech giant is two years into a radical new experiment: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22659497/apple-slack-organizing-zoe-schiffer-decoder-interview"&gt;using Slack&lt;/a&gt;. Where Apple employees previously worked in ultra-siloed teams with little opportunity to meet people outside their current project or department, they now have a way to communicate with anyone across the company. Employees have discovered that individual work grievances are shared by people in entirely different parts of Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNJas1"&gt;The details of these grievances vary. Some employees want the company to invest in internal tools to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;better protect their privacy&lt;/a&gt;. Others want more transparency in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22633141/apple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;how much people are paid&lt;/a&gt;. Many who’ve spoken to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; feel like Apple’s employee relations team has been woefully inadequate in addressing their workplace concerns. The overarching desire — the thing that connects the tenured software engineer in Cupertino with the retail employee in New Jersey — is that employees want to feel heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhXKPi"&gt;So far, it’s not entirely clear Apple executives want to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OjwvBu"&gt;
&lt;p id="73RZT1"&gt;When Kate Rotondo started working as a software engineering author at Apple in August 2018, she did so knowing she was an exception: while most of Apple’s corporate workforce was in person, she would be allowed to work from home once a week, with the option of “earning” a second remote day after six months on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6IAQY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She made $10,000 to $15,000 less in base pay than the others at her same job level.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXl9sp"&gt;By Apple’s standards, it was a compromise. What Rotondo wanted, what she’d asked for, was to be fully remote. The last three years had taken it out of her. She’d moved from Tübingen, Germany, to San Francisco, gotten a divorce, and was now raising her nine-year-old son under complicated co-parenting conditions. The last thing she needed was a three to four hour commute. But her manager was firm: working entirely from home wasn’t an option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bN4DN"&gt;When she started her new job, Rotondo was surprised to find that this hiring manager was entirely remote himself. As were her three other team members — all men. Rotondo was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; person on her team required to go into the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78ttAe"&gt;Still, it was Apple. What was Rotondo going to do? She put it out of her mind for six months, until she spoke to a colleague who was going from contract to full-time and wanted to talk about compensation. He was being leveled as an ICT-4 — one level above Rotondo — and would be making $25,000 more in base pay, with an additional $20,000 more in restricted stock units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6xpRk"&gt;The revelation shocked Rotondo. She felt like she was more experienced than her male colleagues. While they’d worked at Apple longer, she’d co-authored a book about the programming language Adobe AIR, taught coding at Mills College and the continuing education department at the Rhode Island School of Design, and was an expert in Apple’s own iOS programming language Swift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1p24j"&gt;She started chatting with peers and found that — of the eight other engineering authors she’d spoken to in her org — she was the lowest paid. She made $10,000 to $15,000 less in base pay than the others at her same job level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmwkUK"&gt;During her review cycle the following year, her manager told her she was achieving expectations and praised how quickly she’d gotten up to speed on the team. He said she was getting a $5,000 bump in base pay and a $3,000 refresher in restricted stock units — far less than what she’d expected. The lowest RSU refresher she’d heard of up until that point was $50,000, over 16 times more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hygMR1"&gt;Rotondo explained to her manager that she felt she was being under-leveled and underpaid, citing the conversations she’d had with colleagues. He countered that she needed to outperform her co-workers in order to be considered for a promotion. To Rotondo, it felt like she was being asked to go above and beyond what her male colleagues were asked to do. They’d come in making more money than her — and they were fully remote. She was achieving expectations while commuting three to four hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DMu41C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the leak felt violating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ioy4mV"&gt;Rotondo took the issue to her manager’s manager. He roped in a member of the employee relations team — Apple’s version of HR — who said they would open an investigation. Two months later, a representative came back and said the employee relations team had found Rotondo was leveled and paid fairly. “You’re getting a $0.00 adjustment,” they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhkXtY"&gt;Shortly afterward, Rotondo resigned. She’d been at Apple nearly two years and felt completely isolated in her battle — gaslit by her managers and Apple’s employee relations team. She had no clear way to air her grievances with colleagues who might feel the same. Five months later, she filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUrKB9"&gt;It would be months before other Apple employees started connecting on Slack and speaking out on Twitter about pay equity and sexism — the very issues Rotondo was trying to fix. But by then, it would already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PK4Vix"&gt;
&lt;p id="M7MrFc"&gt;Before May 2021, the public rarely heard from Apple employees like Kate Rotondo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ObIA5"&gt;“There was a perception that when you went behind the curtain at Apple, you’d never be heard from again,” says Jason Snell. Steve Jobs was so adamant about keeping his workforce under wraps that he removed all the names from the ‘About’ boxes on the software when he returned to Apple in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhUh6X"&gt;Internally, that secrecy is enforced through a series of norms and rules. The norms are simple: don’t speak publicly about Apple unless you’ve been specifically asked. The rules are less so: Employee badges only open certain doors, based on the projects on which they’re disclosed. They’re asked to sign project-specific NDAs. Product documents are coded with internal keywords like “Ultra,” “Black,” and “White,” which connote how secret the work is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ruLLPf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a strong expectation that internal problems should be kept internal.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fRmMkp"&gt;Ultra projects — reserved for Apple’s biggest product launches — are tracked on an internal Apple system that monitors employees who have prototype devices. Apple requires vendors to sign an NDA as well as an Apple Restricted Project Agreement before they can receive information about this type of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZpAyA"&gt;“This environment of secrecy produces an unwritten hierarchy of ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ within the company,” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/9/11/16288896/apple-secrecy-inkling-culture-leadership-transparency-values"&gt;wrote former employee Matt Macinnis&lt;/a&gt;. “For the ‘haves,’ the hierarchy of disclosure is a way to exert influence and demonstrate power beyond one’s role or title. For ‘have-nots,’ it’s a subtle but constant reminder of your rank.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKdpEK"&gt;The Apple value that underpins all of this, elevating the secrecy concerns from an issue of potential lost revenue to one of core company DNA, is “surprise and delight.” It’s the idea that Apple products should catch the public unaware, giving them something they want before they even know they want it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cf0lSx"&gt;But the secrecy has bled over into other parts of Apple’s culture, too. Although the company specifically says that its policies “should not be interpreted as restricting your right to speak freely about your wages, hours, or working conditions,” the reality is that there’s a strong expectation that internal problems should be kept internal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Ba1p"&gt;For many Apple employees, these idiosyncrasies are seen as the cost of working at Apple — one of, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, most prestigious tech firm in Silicon Valley. People know what they’re getting into when they sign up. Employees stay for decades, giving up lucrative opportunities at early-stage startups because they believe in the company’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kB1ouK"&gt;But for others, the company’s refusal to listen to its own workforce is becoming a bigger sticking point, particularly during an era when the balance of power is shifting away from managers and toward rank and file employees — at least, everywhere but Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="C6knp6"&gt;
&lt;p id="i1spFf"&gt;On May 11th, 2021, a group of female Apple employees discovered that Apple had hired Antonio García Martínez, a former Facebook product manager, who’d written a Silicon Valley tell-all book containing misogynistic descriptions of women. One passage that began circulating internally said most women in the Bay Area were “soft and weak, cosseted and naïve despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5Ylsv"&gt;Employees discussed the issue in the #women-in-swe Slack channel, eventually deciding to write an internal letter to Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of services. They didn’t want García Martínez to be fired necessarily; they just wanted answers as to how he’d been hired in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZqVGmv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the leak felt violating.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="djVjZW"&gt;García Martínez was set to work on privacy on the ad platforms team. His direct working group was all men. Apple’s VP of ad platforms, ​​Todd Teresi, had no women reporting directly to him, save for his chief of staff. The idea that there might not have been any women on García Martínez’s hiring panel infuriated Apple employees and further spurred the organizing effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JCD0n"&gt;The following day, while the letter was still being finalized, a version of it leaked to the press. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published it in full&lt;/a&gt;. Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzzKYB"&gt;To many women in the channel, the leak felt violating. They’d meant for the letter to remain internal and genuinely wanted to engage Apple’s leadership and hear what they had to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THGN3C"&gt;But it also marked a turning point in Apple employee organizing. After the &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; article was published, another group of employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;wrote a letter asking Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; to publicly support Palestine amid a deadly bombing campaign from Israel. Then, the #remote-work-advocacy channel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;published a letter&lt;/a&gt; pushing back against returning to the office. They circulated a survey asking people how they felt about going back to in-person work. The results of the survey also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;quickly became public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UyjxTq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Now, employees know that if their tweets get enough attention, they might be insulated from overt retaliation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUkqLi"&gt;The advocacy brought Apple workers into a widespread campaign for change that had been shaking up the tech industry since at least 2018. Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html"&gt;staged major walkouts&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. Amazon warehouse workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;attempted to unionize&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook employees seemingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm"&gt;spent all of 2020 leaking their discontent to the press&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg5VJ5"&gt;This was the first time, however, that Apple employees had joined the fight: openly pushing back against the decisions — or non-decisions — of company leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G50OCx"&gt;Apple historically dissuaded employees from talking about work on social media — even in seemingly harmless ways. The company’s guidelines are vague: “Be thoughtful about how you present yourself in online social networks,” they read. “The lines between public and private, and personal and professional, are blurred in online social networks. In particular, it’s a priority that we respect the privacy of our customers and other employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAGdpF"&gt;Still, multiple employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that those who tweet about Apple quickly receive a note from the business communications team asking to chat. They don’t always get in trouble, but the message is clear: Apple executives are watching.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoZj9v"&gt;In the past, that was enough to stop most employees from speaking out. Now, employees know that if their tweets get enough attention, they might be insulated from overt retaliation. That is, unless Apple claims they’ve violated company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KVTxa5"&gt;
&lt;p id="U1YTVe"&gt;Cher Scarlett already had a significant Twitter following by the time she landed at Apple as a software engineer on the security team in April 2020. But for the first year, she didn’t tweet about workplace concerns. It wasn’t until news of García Martínez’s hiring started circulating internally that she finally decided to speak out.  “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1392618677644767238?lang=en"&gt;she tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, &amp;amp; that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gp8idF"&gt;Over the next few months, Scarlett became more vocal about issues she was seeing at the company. When she looked at levels.fyi, a website for people to compare salary data, she realized that women on her team seemed to be making less than men — at least in her geographic area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LN6l2N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So Gjøvik decided to go nuclear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJJqeJ"&gt;She knew that Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down three separate employee-run pay surveys&lt;/a&gt;, claiming they either contained personally identifiable information or were hosted on Apple’s corporate Box account, which wasn’t allowed. So she decided to run her own survey. After it got roughly 2,000 responses, she &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426434491069861895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1426434491069861895%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22633141%2Fapple-pay-equity-survey-results-wage-gap"&gt;tweeted out some of the results&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that there were far fewer women, non-binary, and non-white people in technical roles or senior positions at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIeVdh"&gt;News of the survey inspired others, including Kate Rotondo, to begin tweeting openly about their own issues trying to get paid and leveled fairly. It was too late for Rotondo to get justice from Apple — she’d already left the tech industry and was working as a potter in San Francisco — but the experience of speaking out was cathartic. The EEOC had not taken action on her case — a devastating blow for someone who hoped Apple might be held accountable and stopped from treating other workers unfairly. Now, she felt like the only way to told the company accountable was to speak out against its tactics on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Vz62Sn"&gt;
&lt;p id="e5U3He"&gt;On July 26th, 2021, Ashley Gjøvik, a senior engineering program manager, posed a question in the #women-in-swe Slack channel. “Do we think Apple does a sufficient job at handling employee complaints about discrimination?” she asked. “Do we feel comfortable even reporting issues?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUHnZg"&gt;The note sparked a long discussion from women who also felt misled by the tech giant’s HR team. Gjøvik herself shared that employee relations had investigated some of her complaints and told her “actions were taken.” “But when I pried further, there was no actual resolution or actions because no Apple ‘policies’ were violated,’” she wrote. Her sentiment was echoed by other women who said they’d experienced similar frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAbg0O"&gt;During the pandemic, Gjøvik had become increasingly concerned about the physical safety of the office. She already knew that her Apple department was located on a superfund site — meaning it required special oversight due to historical waste contamination. Then she received an email saying Apple wanted to do a vapor intrusion survey in the office and test the quality of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T7bCBH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“ignore the problem, say as little as possible.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2ClVk"&gt;Gjøvik raised her concerns to her boss, saying she was worried about her safety and the safety of her other colleagues. She says he responded that she shouldn’t share her concerns with any coworkers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5POGU"&gt;Gjøvik went to the employee relations team and asked them to tell her boss to stop saying she couldn’t talk about workplace safety. Instead, she says they opened an investigation into whether he’d violated any policies related to sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQzZag"&gt;About a month later, they came back and said he hadn’t. When Gjøvik asked what her options were, the employee relations representative suggested she file an ADA accommodation request to continue working remotely after September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p5IG7"&gt;To Gjøvik, the request did not solve her concerns about the physical safety of the office. But she didn’t have many other options, so she filled out the form, writing that she had “serious concerns about [the] workplace safety of my building and Apple’s other buildings on chemical release sites.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUIKPv"&gt;Apple told her she’d also need to fill out a medical release form that would give her records to Sedgwick, a third-party claims company, as well as Apple, Inc. Gjøvik said she wouldn’t do it unless the form was amended to say her records would just be released to Sedgwick, not Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jea8t8"&gt;She never received the accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8HEuN"&gt;Gjøvik was frustrated; she felt like she’d been keeping Apple’s secrets for years, staying quiet about mistreatment from her boss and team members, and now — when she had a real health concern — the team was telling her to stay quiet. So she decided to go nuclear: talking about her experience on Twitter and opening up to the press about what she was going through. A few of her tweets contained redacted screenshots of bullying comments from her teammates. One suggested Apple’s access to her work phone was inappropriate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;having resulted in her having to hand over nude photos of herself&lt;/a&gt; during an unrelated legal dispute years before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhGiAQ"&gt;In August and early September, both Gjøvik and Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/"&gt;filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt;. Gjøvik said she’d faced harassment, intimidation, and an unsafe and hostile work environment. Scarlett filed on behalf of all Apple employees, saying the company had been limiting their protected right to organize and discuss pay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qWBTEy"&gt;
&lt;p id="LLEDbF"&gt;If Apple had a playbook for how to respond to allegations of discrimination and abuse over the last four months, it was “ignore the problem, say as little as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22VlkN"&gt;On August 20th, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;announced it was delaying its return to work until at least January 2022&lt;/a&gt; due to a rise in COVID-19 cases. Advocacy about the issue quickly died down as employees realized they weren’t going to be forced back to Cupertino anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6oAxFC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The firing is the first real sign that Apple executives may, in fact, be paying attention.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KClDy2"&gt;The company did start cracking down on non-work Slack channels. After the García Martínez letter, employee relations announced a series of rules that banned channels not related to Apple business unless they were part of an official club or diversity group. The rule did not apply to existing channels, creating a bizarre scenario where Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650751/apple-bans-pay-equity-slack-channel"&gt;banned a company-wide pay equity channel&lt;/a&gt; but left the #fun-dogs, #fun-cats, and #dad-jokes channels alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGtvUk"&gt;Then, on September 9th, Apple made its first major public move in combating employee dissent: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22666049/apple-fires-senior-engineering-program-manager-ashley-gjovik-for-allegedly-leaking-information"&gt;it fired Gjøvik&lt;/a&gt;. The company said she had leaked Apple’s confidential information in violation of her NDA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yO3I7"&gt;The firing is the first real sign that Apple executives may, in fact, be paying attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbPWEE"&gt;Still, Apple likely won’t be able to stop employees from talking to one another. Too many of them have already met and started to organize. Some have joined non-work Discord channels to talk about pay equity and other issues that span Apple’s various teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72E1OW"&gt;It’s too early to tell where all this activity is going. Apple employee organizing is helmed by a relatively small group of workers, some of whom are burnt out and ready to leave the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5QOZe"&gt;There’s also the issue of internal resistance coming from other factions of Apple’s workforce. While many employees don’t want to return to the office, they disagree with how the activists have gone about pushing for change. After Gjøvik started to gain momentum on Twitter, multiple current and former Apple employees tweeted about how they were suspicious of her claims and felt like she was merely trying to get attention. On Slack, when employees talk about their concerns with privacy or a general lack of transparency, they’re often met with pushback from people who say they should have known what they were signing up for when they joined the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk6SIB"&gt;To some employees, the bargain of working at Apple is to endure the hierarchical, secretive nature of the company. But to the workers who are pushing back, the question they’re asking is: does it really have to be this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29ivxQ"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>USB-C cables are getting new, confusing logos for faster 240W charging standard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="usb-c" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RExhSb55AiFJKgW9vswIidKp_QY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932870/vlad-savov-computex-usb-c-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Azf3Cn"&gt;The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) — the group that maintains the USB standard across its many varied incarnations — has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210930005098/en/USB-IF-Announces-New-Certified-USB-Type-C%C2%AE-Cable-Power-Rating-Logos"&gt;introduced new, official logos&lt;/a&gt; for companies to use to brand their USB-C cables and packaging to go with its USB4 and 240W power standards. The goal is a noble one, aiming to help ease the confusion about the different types of USB-C cables (which can differ widely in things like charging and data transfer speeds) when you’re buying one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoxqkC"&gt;Naturally, the USB-IF, in its... unique wisdom, has chosen to simplify things the only way it knows how: a slew of new logos that will soon adorn packaging for cables and chargers to help indicate to customers what charging and data speeds their devices support. Because nothing says “simple” like a chart of seven new logos for charging and data specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgfqk8qtjhRLlBM6xt8kagmJ8QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890719/New_USB_Image_for_PR_FINAL_v2__1_.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HXdE8q"&gt;The new branding is meant to tie in with the recent USB Power Delivery (USB PD) 3.1 specification &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr"&gt;that was announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, which (confusingly) is part of the USB Type-C Release 2.1 specification, and offers devices that can charge with up to 240W of power — assuming you have the right cable and charger. Given that the aforementioned mess of numbers and specification releases is an even less consumer-friendly nightmare, the new logos (which clearly state the supported maximum speed and charging for a USB4-certified device) are definitely better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R9ygSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E0gDtB"&gt;But the new logos also help show just how confusing the USB-C standard still is. There are separate logos for supporting 40Gbps data transfer speeds, as well as slower 20Gbps speeds, and two tiers of power specs too: 240W and 60W. More maddening is that the standards aren’t tied together: You might get a cable that supports 40Gbps data transfers but slower charging. You might get a fast-charging 240W cable that’s bad for transferring files. You can get both (with the USB-IF offering a combined logo to indicate when hardware support both fast charging and data speeds), but it’s still putting the onus on manufacturers to actually use the branding and customers to figure it all out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0Kjof"&gt;Compared with the pricier, but simpler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21317513/intel-thunderbolt-4-standard-docks-cables-usb4-accessories-port-usbc"&gt;Thunderbolt 4&lt;/a&gt; — which just has one type of cable that does &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the things in the specification — and it’s hard not to feel like the rest of the USB-C world is still a bit of a mess. Some of that is due to how rapidly USB-C standards have changed in the past few years as technology has gotten better, hardware has improved, and devices need faster data and charging support. But there’s still a long way to go before USB-C achieves its plug-and-play potential — if it ever does. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC considers new rules to stop scammers from hijacking your cell phone </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eb64yaLSkWjgTX69EMikcliJTx8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932850/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bh4iXE"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Thursday said it’s looking into tightening rules around cell phone service, in an effort to rein in SIM swapping scams and port-out fraud, two ways fraudsters can access a person’s cell phone account and phone number for nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htV8kv"&gt;The agency says in a statement it has received numerous complaints “from consumers who have suffered significant distress, inconvenience, and financial harm” due to SIM swapping and port-out fraud. And, the FCC said, recent data breaches have exposed customer information that could make it easier for bad actors to carry out these kinds of attacks successfully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pw3DTV"&gt;SIM swapping is when someone hijacks your cell phone number so they can intercept two-factor authentication codes — the ones you use to verify a log-in or account access — to gain access to your account information. Typically, a bad actor is able to convince their victim’s cell phone carrier to transfer service to a different device, which the victim doesn’t have access to, but the bad actor does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xp8Q70"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/port-out-fraud-targets-your-private-accounts"&gt;Port-out fraud&lt;/a&gt; happens when the fraudster poses as their victim and opens an account with a different cell phone carrier than the victim’s and has the victim’s phone number transferred — or “ported out” — to the new account with the different carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMZjQ1"&gt;In most instances, if the bad actor has access to a piece of personal identifying information, they can pull off either (or both) of these scams before the victim realizes what has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pD6nfI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to set up two-factor authentication on your online accounts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8wC1Vh"&gt;Most security experts recommend using a third-party authenticator app to provide 2FA rather than receiving a text message with a log-in code, which is a less secure method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cm1cza"&gt;The FCC has now issued a formal notice of proposed rulemaking and said in a &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-376199A1.pdf"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; it wants to amend the current rules to require carriers to adopt more secure methods of authenticating a customer’s identity before they redirect service or a phone number to a new device or carrier. The agency is also proposing requiring carriers to immediately notify a customer whenever a SIM change or port request is made on their account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GZF7z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is bringing digital car keys to its phones, starting in South Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qXKWdETOcwUbS_v8JGlzIioPWNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932693/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w19mFK"&gt;After announcing plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;for digital car keys in its phones&lt;/a&gt; during the Galaxy S21 launch, Samsung is finally starting to &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/pressreleases/unlock-a-new-experience-galaxy-users-can-now-use-secure-digital-car-key-with-genesis-gv60"&gt;add support for the feature&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung says support for the ultra wideband (UWB) and NFC-enabled digital car keys will hit South Korea first, and it will only work with one car to start — &lt;a href="https://www.genesis.com/worldwide/en/models/luxury-suv-genesis/gv60/highlights.html"&gt;the all-electric Genesis GV60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW1qhN"&gt;On devices that support UWB — the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus and Ultra, Note 20 Ultra, and Galaxy Z Fold 2 and 3 — Samsung promises “passive entry,” meaning you can unlock and lock your car without pulling your phone out of your bag or pocket. With your phone nearby, you’ll also be able to start your car and make adjustments to mirrors, seats, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFQZydkuorE6iZ5Er70COiC6ojs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890971/001_genesis_samsung_digital_key.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How keys for the Genesis GV60 will appear on Samsung’s phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EAmmYS"&gt;The digital keys are stored in Samsung Pass — and protected by an “embedded Secure Element (eSE)” —  and, according to Samsung, can be shared with anyone running Android 11 with its app downloaded. That amounts to accessing one type of car in one region right now, but Samsung has partnerships with Audi, BMW, and Ford. Hopefully, those carmakers will add support soon now that Genesis has broken the seal. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Samsung for details on when more cars and regions will be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9YryH"&gt;Also, since Samsung is supporting NFC for keys, older Galaxy phones running Android 11 should be able to get into the fun. Samsung now uses UWB and NFC for two headlining features on its phones: these digital car keys and finding items with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;the Galaxy SmartTag it announced in January&lt;/a&gt;. That brings it in parallel with Apple, which introduced digital car keys enabled by the U1 chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;alongside iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021) review: cut by the Blade</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is still great, but it’s no longer on top&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AM7TxH"&gt;Asus has refreshed its blockbuster, category-defining Zephyrus G14, a gaming laptop that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;so successful last year&lt;/a&gt; that it was basically impossible to buy in the months following its release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4cydi"&gt;As was probably wise, the company has made very few changes to last year’s product. The 2021 Zephyrus G14 has last year’s chassis with new chips (AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors and Nvidia’s RTX 3000 mobile GPUs). There are also new display options: last year’s model had a 1080p 120Hz panel or a 1440p 60Hz panel, while this year’s offers the choice of a QHD 120Hz screen or a 1080p 144Hz screen, in addition to a 1080p 60Hz option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5omkns"&gt;Those updates put the G14 a bit closer to the premium category than it was last year, and the price reflects that — the entry-level RTX configuration, which was $1,499 last year, has been bumped up to $1,549. That’s still decent value, but it’s no longer the rarity that it was in last year’s market. The competition has gotten more powerful, and it’s not too much more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Republic of Gamers nameplate on the lid of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k6n_elcCEoFoGxxFhk6q0l1Ckec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804778/akrales_210824_4724_0120.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We meet again, Zephyrus G14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jMlGyh"&gt;All 2021 Zephyrus G14 models have AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series processors. The top option is the eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HS. This is more efficient than other chips in the Ryzen 9 series (such as the 5900HX, which powers the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Razer Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;), but it still packs some serious power. My test unit paired this chip with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, as well as 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and the QHD 120Hz display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; are a trend that’s exploded this year, in part because Ryzen 5000 and RTX 3000 chips have finally made QHD gaming a reasonable possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I5QTAI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10782239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard of the ROG Zephyrus G14 seen from the side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkvI-sxWe-EQs_24S0-v7FI8tVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804774/akrales_210824_4724_0048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is legitimately my favorite keyboard on any laptop ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m5FxvC"&gt;This configuration is listed for $1,999.99 on &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-series/spec"&gt;Asus’ website&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s sold out there as of this writing), and it’s pretty much the top model you can buy. The &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-aw-se-series/spec"&gt;other $1,999.99 model&lt;/a&gt; is one that Asus developed with DJ Alan Walker, which comes with fancy packaging that can function as a DJ deck. It’s a bit specced down, though, including just an RTX 3050 Ti and 16GB of RAM. (We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;reviewed that device separately&lt;/a&gt; — it’s cool, but mostly cool for Alan Walker fans.) Both of these models also include the AniMe Matrix, a fancy grid of LEDs on the G14’s lid that can form cool animated designs if you’re so inclined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MLr3X"&gt;Those are the only two configurations currently listed on Asus’ website. I’ve also been able to find a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGWIbcuxZB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,549.99 model&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy that includes the RTX 3060, 16GB of RAM, and the 144Hz 1080p display (which is likely better value than my test unit), as well as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGWJxeLuhV#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $1,149.99 model&lt;/a&gt; with a 60Hz display, a Ryzen 7 5800HS, and a GeForce GTX 1650. &lt;a href="https://www.excaliberpc.com/768172/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-ga401qm-211.zg14b.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Excalibur PC&lt;/a&gt; also has an RTX 3060 / QHD / 16GB / 1TB model for $1,799.99. None of these include the AniMe Matrix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 seen from above, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3xVAna_dNAZV8MA_PK9beopPink=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804772/akrales_210824_4724_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our test configuration is pricey for its specs, but some of Best Buy’s options are more reasonable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ghNhSQ"&gt;The biggest thing to take away from all this is that the G14 has a ceiling — the RTX 3060 and the Ryzen 9 5900HS are the best you can get. Last year, that combination would’ve made it the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop in the world. But there’s a reason that’s not the case anymore, and it’s called the Razer Blade 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mvbv7m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The G14 has a ceiling&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zptUJj"&gt;The Zephyrus averaged 191fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO &lt;/em&gt;at native resolution and 263fps in 1080p. Dust particles, fires, clouds, and other intense effects were no problem. It averaged 33fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;with all sliders maxed at 1440p, 40fps on the Ultra preset, and 51fps on the Ultra preset in 1080p. (DLSS wasn’t super effective in this game, oddly — I only saw 42fps on the Ultra preset at 1440p with the feature set to “quality.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7CFGO"&gt;Where the RTX 3060 really struggled was ray tracing in &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. The G14 averaged 28fps on the highest preset with the feature set to Ultra (DLSS was helpful here, bumping that average up to 42fps). It did much better with ray tracing off, averaging 57fps at native resolution and 83fps in 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g80R7CjJ21qt0V2cRwyI9s0284s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804775/akrales_210824_4724_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power port, HDMI, USB-C, headphone jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hj4uOQ8hzgrTShxHsBTsPjy-wLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804773/akrales_210824_4724_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lock slot, two USB-A, one USB-C on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rOTNSn"&gt;Right off the bat, these results are a sizable step up from last year’s G14; this model’s beating it on all three titles in 1080p. However, it still can’t quite run all of these games at playable frame rates in QHD unless you bump some settings down (though it can certainly take full advantage of its 120Hz display with esports fodder like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPwL5z"&gt;The more demanding titles are where the performance gap between the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3070 really becomes apparent. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor and a 3070 crushed the G14 on both &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;(averaging 58fps) and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;(61fps with ray tracing on, 81fps with ray tracing off) in 1440p. That model is actually &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGWK2rjb4O#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than my G14 unit — it doesn’t include the AniMe Matrix and only has 16GB of RAM. The G15 also comes with &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g15-series/spec" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; (with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage), for an even cheaper $1,499.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ne1ZoN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Where the RTX 3060 really struggled was ray tracing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyk3SX"&gt;The Razer Blade 14 I tested had an RTX 3070 as well as a Ryzen 9 5900HX, in a chassis that’s actually a little bit smaller than the G14’s. It also gave the Zephyrus a run for its money on both &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; (averaging 58fps and 51fps in QHD, respectively). An RTX 3070 Blade 14 is more expensive than this G14 model (&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14-%2FRZ09-0370BEA3-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,199.99 as of this writing&lt;/a&gt;) and only has 16GB of RAM, but still offers a lot for that price — you get not only the extra power, but also a 165Hz QHD screen, an RGB keyboard, and a webcam. The G14 doesn’t even have a great cost argument against the Blade 14 if you want to stick with the RTX 3060, because you can also buy the latter with an RTX 3060 and a 144Hz display &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-blade-14-14-gaming-laptop-fhd-144hz-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-black%2F6472588.p%3FskuId%3D6472588&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,799.99&lt;/a&gt; ($200 less than my test model). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="2do5E3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10782255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPAl0c"&gt;One final thing to note on gaming — this thing gets hot. While I didn’t see evidence of throttling necessarily, the 5900HS was consistently in the high 80s (Celsius) or low 90s during gameplay. (On the bigger G15, for context, the same chip ran through all the same titles without jumping above 80.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfy9bo"&gt;The G14’s case also got very, very hot during gameplay. The keyboard was uncomfortable to touch, and the bottom was blistering. If I held my hand right above the keys, I could feel the heat. This wasn’t too far from the experience I had with last year’s G14, but the Blade 14 did a better job with even more powerful components. While it had some trouble keeping its chip cool, the heat didn’t transfer to the outside of its chassis in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh2XWT"&gt;The fans were also loud during gameplay, though you can switch to a “Silent” profile in Asus’ Armoury Crate software. I used this while doing regular office work with the G14, and it did live up to its name while keeping the keyboard cool (though the bottom of the chassis was still toasty most of the time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ufI71i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard was uncomfortable to touch, and the bottom was blistering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52IA8p"&gt;So what does the 2021 G14 have going for it? Pretty much everything else. The display is crisp and vivid, maxing out at 300 nits and covering 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, 87 percent of AdobeRGB, and 99 percent of P3. The speakers — including two downward-firing woofers and two tweeters, deliver clear audio with resonant bass and forceful percussion. The G14 comes preloaded with Dolby Access, including audio presets for games, music, movies, and voice. (The Music profile makes vocals clearer, while the Music and Game presets give the backing tracks more oomf.) The microphones had no trouble picking up my voice on work calls, even with some background noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus logo on the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqnEkOy3T2glOGQoOxmlopOluJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804777/akrales_210824_4724_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a nice, subdued design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The top corner of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihLIE-w4waUfNcXp4iKk-u1RaUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804779/akrales_210824_4724_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not quite as beautiful as the Blade, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NJpx1w"&gt;The chassis is thin, light, and sturdy, and the ErgoLift hinge, an Asus staple that folds under the deck and lifts the keyboard slightly off the ground, isn’t as sharp in your lap as it is on some other Asus laptops. And the G14’s keyboard and touchpad are some of my favorites — not just among gaming laptops but among all laptops on the market. The keys are backlit, quiet, and comfortable, with plenty of travel and a satisfying click — I especially appreciate the dedicated volume keys at the top of the deck. The trackpad is quite smooth, with one of the easiest clicks you’ll find on a laptop. I didn’t see any palm rejection issues and could generally scroll without hitting plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4gQvGs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The display is crisp and vivid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwC7MM"&gt;Finally, battery life is an area where the G14 solidly beats the Blade 14. That’s to be expected, given the former’s more efficient processor. Using the G14 as my daily driver with an office workload, I averaged nine hours and 38 minutes. (This was with Battery Saver on, the screen around 200 nits, and the GPU disabled.) That’s longer than I saw from last year’s G14 as well as this year’s G15, and it makes this model one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops I’ve ever tested. The Blade averaged just six hours and 12 minutes from the same workload.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7ggj4"&gt;Battery gaming was also a decent experience. I got an hour and two minutes of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; gameplay on the Ultra preset; the game was playable for 57 minutes of that time and dropped to stuttery frame rates after that (with around 10 percent remaining). The 180-watt charger is decently fast, though not exceptionally so. It took 50 minutes to juice the G14 up to 60 percent during light Chrome use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G14 open on a table seen from above. The screen displays the ROG logo on a black and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBlpY7JcOAdLq-B6PXfSaYPo7YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804770/akrales_210824_4724_0027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This model is white, so no fingerprint problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="av0Olw"&gt;There are only two real issues with the chassis. First, the fingerprint sensor on my unit was finicky and failed to recognize me about a third of the time. I’ve asked Asus whether this is an issue they’ve encountered before. The second is that there’s no webcam. One of the benefits of a thin and light device like the G14 is that it’s supposed to make for a great multipurpose driver, which is a significantly taller order when it can’t do video calls. Yes, you can plug in an external camera, but that’s a whole extra thing, and it’s especially annoying if you’re carrying the G14 around a lot. Asus really should just stick a webcam on this thing, even a lousy one, especially since its competitors have them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uyF5w6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10782277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CoJqQR"&gt;At the end of the day, the G14 is still excellent. It’s a good performer in a good chassis, with a keyboard, touchpad, speaker system, and battery life span that are absolute standouts. (Seriously — I apologize to whatever keyboard I have to review after this one, because it’s probably going to look bad in comparison.) And the new chips have delivered a marked improvement over last year’s G14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jftia3"&gt;Unfortunately, while this laptop hasn’t changed that much, its competition has. The G14 is no longer the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy — and while its battery life in particular may still make it a great buy for some users, it’s no longer the obvious choice for everyone. The Blade 14 offers significantly more powerful chips in a chassis that’s thinner and almost as light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWU2c2"&gt;And while the Blade 14 is more expensive, there are also a number of ways to get an RTX 3070 for a lower price than the G14 is asking here. If you’re willing to go for something slightly bigger and miss out on the fancy lights, the Zephyrus G15 will give this exact chassis design (with the same exceptional keyboard, touchpad, audio, and battery life) with much better gaming results for less money. If you still want fancy lights, you can also get a 5900HX and an RTX 3070 (along with a 144Hz display) in the RGB-packed &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-ROG-Strix-G513-R9-Gaming-Laptop-15-6-FHD-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3060-16GB-RAM-1TB-SSD-Eclipse-Gray-Windows-10-Home-G513QM-WS96%2F414650603&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROG Strix G15&lt;/a&gt; at a lower price than my test unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qdL8c4"&gt;Again, the G14 is still excellent. But there’s more excellent stuff in this category now than there was last year. The G14 has moved out of “slam-dunk” territory and into “good option for people who want a specific combination of things” territory. Which is, to be fair, where almost all gaming laptops live. &lt;/p&gt;
