  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $395&lt;/a&gt; in select colors, which is $29 off its usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as $385 at Amazon (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; only) or for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; in gold only.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for $529 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $540, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594487-REG%2Fapple_myfq2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; currently have the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors for $559. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted in all color variants at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $679, which is $70 off its usual price of $749. Walmart has a sale on the iPad Air 256GB for as low as $699 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Sky-Blue%2F483096080%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="XeRDay"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863358NV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration on sale for $846,&lt;/a&gt; if you buy it in space gray or you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$850 in silver&lt;/a&gt;. You can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BT4DD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for $1,050&lt;/a&gt; in both colors. Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08634Y7QW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JF4KR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $948&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,030&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,223&lt;/a&gt;. The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,420 in silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right) | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $35 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 more than its lowest price yet. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information on sale for $45 (usually $60). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $45 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; right now it is on sale for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $60 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $160&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $40 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $51, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;Right now, Amazon’s Echo Show 10 is on sale for the first time ever. You can grab the latest generation Echo Show 10 for $210 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to truly wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, I encourage you to read out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Best Wireless Earbuds buyer’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you determine which pair of earbuds is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products in general, the AirPods Pro are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant has better sound quality and features noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. You can also get a new pair for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has the earbuds available for $219.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of AirPods with a wireless charging case. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, they are $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are no current deals available for the Galaxy Buds Pro, but you can buy a pair for the usual retail price of $200 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771584476830246" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771635387220077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Plus were our top pick last year as the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in different color options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9qe27"&gt;Right now, you can get a pair for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693938480222182" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$110 at Samsung’s direct website&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693993307410932" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now — but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. These are a good option if you want earbuds that produce a powerful sound and include lengthy battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;The lowest price you can buy the Samsung GalaxyBuds Live is $60 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168432735464332#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt; But, if you want new pair of these bean-shaped earbuds you can get them for $140 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733697059048914646#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736564903391373246#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t. Although no deals are available now, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for their normal price of $228 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If a $230 price tag is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. The Jabra 75t are our pick for the best true wireless earbuds that are ideal for the multitasker in your life. They’re a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9znxnQ"&gt;You can buy a pair in titanium black for its usual price of $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733698116592948428" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the Beats Powerbeats Pro. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about sweat ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Best Buy for $160 in either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773015236913845" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Odu94n"&gt;Amazon has select colors (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTDP6H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07WBTX9FH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy blue&lt;/a&gt;) on sale for $170.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best video game subscription deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCwJnaJqB9nSAdB083CzqHiRqPY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69062112/acastro_210113_1777_gamingstock_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ve6XpF"&gt;Online game subscriptions are quite common in the gaming industry. Whether it's a subscription for an online service for multiplayer gaming or Netflix-like services that provide access to a massive library of games to play, gaming subscriptions provide good incentives and a lot of value for many gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAgFMs"&gt;While sales tend to stay steady throughout the year, these subscription services will hold promotions or discounts now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="75ZAPD"&gt;PlayStation subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2CYtx"&gt;PlayStation Plus is arguably the most popular subscription service available on PlayStation consoles. Subscribing comes with a few perks outside of occasional discounts on the PlayStation Store and playing (most) games online. Each month, Sony provides a rotation of games you can play for free so long as you have an active subscription. If you own a PS5, you have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PS Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of “generation-defining games” originally released for the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouXbHO"&gt;A one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus normally retails for $60, but &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fpsn-subscriptions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba&lt;/a&gt; tends to sell digital keys for US subscribers for less than half of its usual price. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals03312021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fplaystation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US players can grab a year for $27&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is $60 at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465838929287529#donlotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-plus-1-year-membership%2F10084626.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. The service is also available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B017V6YVDC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK57U?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 for three months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQl0wf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eA7sP"&gt;PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming service, allowing subscribers to stream games released on the PS2, PS3, and PS4 on their PS4, PS5, and PCs. The service tends to release new games into the library regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6jNP0"&gt;New users can do a seven-day free trial to get a feel for the service. Otherwise, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B00ZGG1HZA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt; costs $10, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465889242682683" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of the service&lt;/a&gt; in advance costs $25, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a year-long subscription&lt;/a&gt; is $60. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-now-12-month-subscription-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba has a one-year subscription available for $27&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest we have seen it go for, although Sony recently had a promotion where new subscribers could get one month free of charge. Alternatively, it is $60 at typical retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-now-1-year-subscription%2F11097720.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6LMQ2H"&gt;Xbox subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LuSn3s"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s flagship gaming subscription right now. Subscribing to this service nets you access to Game Pass Console and Game Pass PC. It bundles Xbox Live Gold, a premium online service. Additionally, Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, is included with Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkcdOo"&gt;You can choose between &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a monthly plan for $15&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $45. If you are new to Game Pass, you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get your first month for $1&lt;/a&gt;, and it will convert to a $15 monthly charge unless you cancel. If you are not a new user of the service but want to renew your subscription for one month only, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1-month-subscription-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba is selling a single month for $9&lt;/a&gt;. If you want three months but don’t want to be billed automatically, you can grab it for its usual price at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-3-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832350399%3FDescription%3DXbox%2520Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate%26cm_re%3DXbox_Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate-_-32-350-399-_-Product" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kZo2dI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tchitw"&gt;Outside of Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft has two separate versions of the service, including one specifically for Xbox consoles, which is probably the better choice for gamers who solely play on the Xbox and are not interested in the other incentives offered by the Ultimate Tier. Again, you can get &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model for $1 if you are new&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt;, $60 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07BKXDW67?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six months&lt;/a&gt;, or $112 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07K782P3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full-year subscription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5pUly"&gt;Another subscription available on consoles is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play?join-now=true"&gt;EA Play&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to a slew of titles published by Electronic Arts. It’s available on a few platforms, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-Access-12-Month-Subscription/dp/B014Q5UNH4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=EA+Play&amp;amp;qid=1617219222&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5498-CUSA15087_00-PSEAA1M000000000"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, but the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;included with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; now. If you are subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate and buy an EA Play subscription, it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription"&gt;convert to a certain number&lt;/a&gt; of days or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lh5L5F"&gt;Nintendo subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BVh6Q6"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online is a good service for owners of Nintendo’s hybrid console if they want to do the following: play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, or get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era. It comes in two forms: an individual membership, which provides access and perks through a single account, or a family membership, which provides access to the service via the same or multiple Switch consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haNwb6"&gt;You can get a seven-day free trial for both. Otherwise, an individual membership costs &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership"&gt;$4 for one month&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV61ZC9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$8 for three&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 for a full year&lt;/a&gt;. You can do it directly through Nintendo’s eShop on the Switch itself; retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/nintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership?partner=voxmedia"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership%2F176406.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership-nintendo-switch-digital%2F-%2FA-78630258&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also sell three-month or one-year subscriptions. The best deal currently is at Eneba, which is selling &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-3-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months for $7&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full year for $18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jEWRuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPkA27"&gt;Family Memberships only include a full-year subscription, which you can buy for $35 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473860075502827#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership"&gt;Nintendo eShop&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IcYUKQ"&gt;PC gaming subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qoeGMy"&gt;Xbox Game Pass for PC is available as a standalone service for those with a gaming PC who do not want all of the perks available with Game Pass Ultimate. Like the console version, Game Pass PC is available for $10 a month or $1 for your first month if you are a new user. Typically, retailers sell the PC-only service for three months, which is normally priced at $30. Currently, Eneba has &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-1-month-microsoft-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one month available&lt;/a&gt; for $8 or &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-3-month-windows-10-store-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $23. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Game-Pass-For-PC-Microsoft-Windows-10-Digital-Download%2F116004075&amp;amp;subid1=VergeGamingSubscriptionDeals03312021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also has a deal on a three-month subscription for $24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HIGoSB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMlkSB"&gt;EA Play is also available on PC, but the prices vary depending on whether you subscribe on Steam or Origin. If you &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriptions/ea#SaleSection_77945"&gt;subscribe to Steam&lt;/a&gt;, it is the same price as consoles ($5 per month, $30 annually). &lt;a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/ea-play"&gt;Origin has EA Play Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $15 monthly or $100 per year. The key biggest difference between EA Play and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pro is the Pro version provides unlimited access to the publisher’s latest releases, similar to how Game Pass provides access to Xbox exclusives on the day those titles release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGmZnI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming"&gt;Ubisoft Plus&lt;/a&gt; (formally UPlay Plus), like EA Play, is a gaming subscription service with a library of games published and developed by Ubisoft. You also receive access to new releases at launch, over 100 games in the library, and Amazon’s Luna and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming services. You can subscribe to a monthly plan, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22348957%2Fbest-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $15 each month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fayzzi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422601"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nx27Nw"&gt;Originally released in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Humble Monthly) is a Humble Bundle gaming subscription. Each month, the company allows subscribers to choose from a curated list of 10 or more DRM-free games, which they can keep forever. Unlike some other services by the company, all of the games are revealed upfront. It comes in &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/checkout?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;three tiers&lt;/a&gt;: Lite ($5 per month), Basic ($15 per month), and Premium ($20 per month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVTwM0"&gt;Mobile game subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YZZ3M2"&gt;Released in 2019, Apple Arcade has its own dedicated tab located on the App Store. It is available on products that run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. It costs $5 per month, or you can get a year for just $50. All of the games available on the service are free of in-app purchases and pesky ads and the option to play these games offline. Subscribers can also share access with five other individuals via family sharing. New users can get a one-month free trial. &lt;/p&gt;

It features over 400 apps and games with no ads or in-app purchases. You can subscribe for $5 monthly or $30 annually. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The huge new Among Us map gives you more ways to be sneaky</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUWl651-CDFzaEsU_K1sXORqDVI=/107x0:1259x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061683/oZKbVT.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Innersloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LXu7Mb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ huge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;Airship map&lt;/a&gt; finally arrived on Wednesday, offering new tasks for crewmates, new ways to get around, and new ways to plot against your friends as the imposter. I tried out the new level for an hour or so last night, and players who might have grown bored of the well-worn pathways of &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; other levels will have a lot to play with on the airship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWJ5Rt"&gt;The airship is &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ biggest map yet, but to my surprise, I actually didn’t feel all that overwhelmed in my first matches. Developer InnerSloth did a great job making the different rooms visually distinct. The circular records room has four large bookshelves, for example, while the kitchen has a charming tile pattern and a pot simmering on a stove. The airship also adds a couple of new ways to get around, including ladders and a floating platform that moves you across a chasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLsZ6m"&gt;On some of &lt;em&gt;Among Us’&lt;/em&gt; other maps, I have trouble remembering exactly where I’ve been. But the notable traits of many of the airship’s locations made them easier to recall when pleading my innocence in player meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8BGC9JF9FC8K0TCaNA5CqoxUUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413405/icAXDi.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: InnerSloth&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GNV6KZ"&gt;For crewmates, the airship has a lot of new tasks to keep you busy while avoiding the imposter. In my hour or so of playtime last night, I hammered a showerhead into place, shined a jewel, waved a phone around to get good reception, fast-forwarded a video cassette, dressed up a mannequin, and even unclogged a toilet. And if you’re a longtime &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; player, you’ll recognize some old standbys — rest assured that your finely honed card swiping skills will be put to good use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRJExb"&gt;If you’re an imposter, the airship is a playground, packed with large objects and distant corners you can use to strategically hide the bodies of your crewmates. And of course, imposters can still use vents to zip from room to room as well as turn off the ship’s lights, communications, and other functions to mess with other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHY05w"&gt;At times, the airship can feel &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; big, though; at the default walking speed, it takes a long time to get from place to place. To help with that, InnerSloth lets you start from one of three rooms every time you jump into the map. But no matter where you start, it still takes a while to get to the opposite side of the ship. In games with fewer players, the sheer size of the airship also means you may not see a lot of your crewmates. It almost seems designed for the &lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/237019/lets-go-airship-new-update-out-now"&gt;upcoming 15 player lobbies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supreme Court says Facebook text alerts aren’t illegal robocalls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpzRT5_9sXpVsN0ekZb9tdkACIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061404/akrales_180614_1777_0110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfXwgQ"&gt;The Supreme Court has unanimously decided that Facebook text message alerts don’t violate laws against unwanted auto-dialed calls. The court ruled that a lower court defined illegal “robocalls” too broadly and that the term should only apply to systems that generate lists of numbers and call them indiscriminately, not a system that simply stores numbers and automatically calls them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GBZ4Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320184/supreme-court-facebook-duguid-robocall-tcpa-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;The lawsuit involves text messages&lt;/a&gt; that notify Facebook users of an attempted login. Its plaintiff, Noah Duguid, sued after receiving unwanted, erroneous notifications despite not having a Facebook account. Duguid argued that Facebook was violating the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). An appeals court agreed, but the Supreme Court interpreted the law’s definitions differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5i6Qy"&gt;Closely parsing the TCPA’s grammar, the court concluded that an illegal auto-dialing system “must use a random or sequential number generator,” and this definition “excludes equipment like Facebook’s login notification system, which does not use such technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9k4Rga"&gt;Facebook argued that the earlier court decision could have defined basic smartphone functions as illegal autodialers. The Supreme Court agreed. “Duguid’s interpretation of an autodialer would capture virtually all modern cell phones,” the opinion says. Although robocalls are a huge problem on American phone networks, it says “expanding the definition of an autodialer to encompass any equipment that merely stores and dials telephone numbers would take a chainsaw to these nuanced problems.” So it’s opting for a much more limited definition — both for Facebook and any similar future system.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung created a whole Hulu series that’s sponcon for the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EINbVH77msO-2UZYvp72Hym-uvY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061399/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u9ylel"&gt;Samsung wants you to know its new phone, the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G, is good at capturing photos. Maybe you could outwardly tell from its five image sensors, including four on the back, that the company takes mobile photography seriously. But if not, you now have an entire Hulu series to watch in which the S21 Ultra 5G is the main character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ene3fx"&gt;The company announced today it’s created a branded Hulu show called &lt;em&gt;Exposure &lt;/em&gt;where up-and-coming photographers compete in challenges to be crowned “America’s best mobile photographer.” The show will debut on April 26th, and it entirely centers on the S21 Ultra 5G; it’s the only device contestants will use to capture their images. This is Samsung’s best attempt at showing off its phone in less of a commercial format — although, in reality, this show is an extended commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pn70uv"&gt;Branded content is nothing new for TV. But typically, these partnerships are more covert. Maybe the device someone uses is a specific phone that they mention aloud, or the hosts of a show drive a specific car that lingers on the screen for a second longer than expected. &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; is, instead, a full-out admittance from Samsung that it is so invested in making sure people know about its camera technology that it’s willing to spend money on an entire series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrad81"&gt;For what it’s worth, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Dieter Bohn said the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G’s cameras did live up to the hype when he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;reviewed the device in January&lt;/a&gt;. “The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best I’ve used on any Android phone and is extremely competitive with the iPhone 12 Pro Max,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVRxML"&gt;These &lt;em&gt;Exposure&lt;/em&gt; contestants will likely capture quality images. You just have to be okay with the fact that you’re watching content that Samsung approves and wants you to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UQgoH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan would take on the wreckage of drilling and mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Navajo Nation uranium mining clean-up" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/In7X64PQnpYhf5AtUr3yAnhERPM=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061375/1194589435.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signs warning of health risks are posted outside the gates of an abandoned uranium mine in the Red Water Pond Road community of the Navajo Nation on January 13th, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=The+Washington+Post" target="_blank"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But it will take more than the $16 billion Biden offered&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ZRlUYK"&gt;In Pittsburgh this week, Joe Biden unveiled a new infrastructure plan that will serve as the centerpiece for his economic agenda. Spending $2 trillion over eight years, the sweeping plan includes a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359496/biden-american-jobs-package-broadband-semiconductors-electric-vehicles"&gt;wide range of measures&lt;/a&gt;, from building out electric vehicle charging stations to de-leading municipal water mains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAfbVs"&gt;As part of the plan, Biden wants to spend an “immediate up-front investment” of $16 billion to plug abandoned oil and gas wells and clean up old mines. He says that money will create “hundreds of thousands” of union jobs. It’s also supposed to stop planet-heating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22360189/gas-stove-methane-leaks-electric-climate-change"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; and other pollution from escaping wells and mines. “Many of these old wells and mines are located in rural communities that have suffered from years of disinvestment,” a fact sheet for the plan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HA43p9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Left alone, those wells and mines pose dangers to the environment and to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQfY7p"&gt;Hazards from abandoned infrastructure are a serious and often ignored problem. Left alone, those wells and mines pose dangers to the environment and to people. They’ve also been a financial headache for states and federal agencies left with the enormous costs associated with safely retiring them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pdaty"&gt;The money could cover some of the costs of remediating the oldest wells and mines, which were dug before companies were required to put aside money for what happens to the site at the end of its life. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Thousands Of Abandoned Wells Pose Pollution Risk In Pennsylvania" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4QnFDLNhSY2qodoI37eVFlhrbeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413277/541872914.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Goodney / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil and other pollutants run from an abandoned oil well on a property near the Allegany National Forest in Marienville, Pennsylvania, on June 7th, 2016. In Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the US oil industry, century-old abandoned oil wells have long been part of the landscape. Nobody gave much thought to it when many were left unplugged or filled haphazardly with dirt, lumber, and cannon balls that slipped or rotted away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5mKC7A"&gt;“Our infrastructure is crumbling,” Biden said during an address in Pittsburgh yesterday. “Put simply, these are investments we have to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4W7rS"&gt;$16 billion could go part of the way toward sweeping up the crumbs of neglected resource-extracting infrastructure. But experts and advocates say it’s only a first step toward fully reckoning with the toxic holes in our landscape left by abandoned wells and mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRKju7"&gt;There are 500,000 abandoned mines in the US, according to the Bureau of Land Management. &lt;a href="http://duwaterlawreview.com/the-abandoned-mine-problem-who-should-bear-the-burden/"&gt;Before the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t unusual or illegal for companies to simply walk away from mines when they were no longer profitable. Waste from those mines has polluted the surrounding soil, water, or air. Metals from these mines can leave behind highly acidic water, which puts fish and the people who eat those fish at risk. Dust from mines can also spread arsenic, lead, and even radioactive material, harming nearby communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHiTdW"&gt;Many of the companies responsible for creating these hazards have left governments with the tab to clean it all up. Between 2008 and 2017, federal agencies spent about &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-238.pdf"&gt;$287 million a year&lt;/a&gt; remediating and monitoring abandoned mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Crs3m"&gt;Then there’s the even bigger problem of abandoned oil and gas wells: at least &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/assets/2020/06/22/document_ew_01.pdf"&gt;57,000 out-of-commission wells&lt;/a&gt; in the US are considered “orphans” because whoever operated them either can’t be identified or can’t afford to plug them. On top of that, there are even more “idle” wells that do have owners but haven’t been used in years and are in danger of becoming orphans. Altogether, there are over 2.1 million of these wells languishing in the US, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2020-main-text.pdf"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency estimate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BriHwk"&gt;Even if the wells are no longer in use, they can still do harm if not properly handled. If they’re not plugged or if the plug fails, the well can spew out oil, gas, and saltwater that might contaminate freshwater or soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="XdfjPu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like a ticking climate bomb.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KLM9vk"&gt;Unplugged wells also &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c04265#:~:text=Abandoned%20oil%20and%20gas%20wells%20are%20one%20of%20the%20most,methane%20emissions%20into%20the%20atmosphere.&amp;amp;text=Methane%20emission%20factors%20range%20from,average%20at%206.0%20g%2Fh."&gt;release methane&lt;/a&gt;, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is far more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat. The EPA estimates that orphan and idle wells are responsible for about &lt;a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/green-stimulus-oil-and-gas-workers-considering-major-federal-effort-plug-orphaned-and-abandoned"&gt;280,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of methane a year, which does about the same harm to the climate as 2.1 million cars do in a year. So plugging those wells would help shrink US greenhouse gas emissions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Swn2Dp"&gt;“It’s like a ticking climate bomb,” says Ben Beachy, a director at Sierra Club. “It’s something that we’re gonna have to deal with one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46FJkE"&gt;The problem could get even worse in the future. If Biden follows through with his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;campaign goal&lt;/a&gt; of putting the US on track to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, someone will eventually have to foot the bill for plugging up 3.8 million open wells — including active ones — in the US. That’ll add up to $280 billion, according to Greg Rogers, who co-authored a &lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/reports/its-closing-time/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on abandoned wells for the financial think tank Carbon Tracker. Taking that into consideration, Biden’s initial $16 billion offer for orphan wells is a drop in the bucket.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnfSZf"&gt;States are already losing a lot of money because of abandoned wells. Even though there are now regulations that require companies to set aside money to pay for decommissioning a well, companies can get away with putting up very little money in a lot of states. In Ohio, a company can put up a $15,000 &lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/wps/portal/gov/odnr/buy-and-apply/regulatory-permits/oil-and-gas-permits/bonding-insurance"&gt;“blanket” bond&lt;/a&gt; to cover an unlimited number of wells. It’s a paltry sum considering the average cost of plugging a single well in the state in 2019 was &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063430105"&gt;$100,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PZGGOx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;States are already losing a lot of money because of abandoned wells&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7nr7M1"&gt;“States accept bonds which basically are equal to pennies on the dollar of the cost to actually do this end-of-life work [to plug wells],” says Rogers. “It’s really a subsidy from the state governments to the oil and gas industry.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVvkcE"&gt;The economics of well remediation are daunting, and the current lack of funding could &lt;a href="https://grist.org/energy/plugging-abandoned-oil-wells-carbon-offsets/"&gt;leave wells dangerously unplugged&lt;/a&gt; — particularly after state budgets took a hit from the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zPO7U"&gt;The average cost of safely plugging an older well falls somewhere between $40,000 to $50,000. But for newer wells that are typically deeper, the cost can reach $300,000, according to Rogers’ report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VEEWZ"&gt;If Biden is going to send federal money to states to help them cover those costs, Rogers says he needs to attach strings that will force companies to take greater responsibility for cleaning up after themselves. That might include prioritizing funding states that set higher bonds for extractive companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EWpvEn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Don’t set the conditions for this problem to continue to repeat itself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cSvgHu"&gt;“Don’t set the conditions for this problem to continue to repeat itself,” says Rogers. “Increase the bonding amount. Get rid of blanket bonds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlLfpb"&gt;Rogers and Beachy are optimistic that all that spending will lead to more jobs, especially for people who previously worked in oil and gas fields or mines. “We have got to make sure that we are proactively, creating good family sustaining jobs in the same communities where workers are facing energy transition,” says Beachy, who’s from West Virginia, where the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/coal-miners-coronavirus-job-losses"&gt;decline of coal&lt;/a&gt; has already &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/215786/coal-mining-employment-in-west-virginia/"&gt;cost jobs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tj6kJ3"&gt;Cleaning up the mess of the past is at the core of Biden’s overall infrastructure plan, which would be funded by an increase in corporate taxes. The plan also allocates money to replace all of the nation’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18250801/lead-contamination-flint-michigan-water-testing"&gt;lead pipes&lt;/a&gt;, which have poisoned children — particularly in communities of color like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/15/10991626/flint-water-crisis"&gt;Flint, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. It also invests in speeding the transition to electric vehicles and a clean energy grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bf2sqB"&gt;But environmental advocates like Beachy are pushing for even more ambitious plans. Sierra Club is part of a network of progressive organizations that have endorsed an infrastructure and pandemic recovery agenda called the “&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/infrastructure-bill-biden-administration-progressive-democrats_n_605e518ec5b6531eed04e2a6"&gt;THRIVE Act&lt;/a&gt;” that would spend $10 trillion over the next decade. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) is expected to introduce it as a bill in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMrkSO"&gt;Democrats will face an uphill battle in Congress to turn any infrastructure plan into actual policies. Whether they come to fruition or not, someone will pay for the costs that come with abandoned wells and mines — whether those costs come from cleaning the mess up or living with the environmental consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI announces two new convertible business laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MSI Summit E13 Flip Evo and E16 Flip on a black and white marble background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zS2drs9ovyim5NynOJFLWKxGyg4=/86x0:1954x1245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061243/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQzSfM"&gt;MSI, a company best known for bold and flashy gaming laptops, has announced two additions to its new Summit Series business line. The Summit E13 Flip Evo and Summit E16 Flip are convertible notebooks powered by Intel’s Tiger Lake processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeEcO8"&gt;The big news is that the new Flips come with 16:10 displays. MSI says the new aspect ratio will provide 10 percent more visible screen space than a similarly sized 16:9 screen. That’s a good sign for business users — it means less scrolling and more room to multitask. Both models are also compatible with MSI’s proprietary MPP 2.0 stylus (the MSI pen), which the company says has 4,096 pressure levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1P9js"&gt;Like the rest of the Summit Series, the two models include a number of features designed for remote meetings. These include a “noise-reduction” camera (with a physical shutter as well as a keyboard kill switch), and audio noise cancellation. MSI claims the notebooks will get 20 hours of battery life, which would certainly be a step up from the five-hour lifespan I got out of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22327287/msi-summit-series-b15-review-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers"&gt;Summit B15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user draws on the MSI Summit E26 in reverse-clamshell mode with a stylus. The screen displays a chart." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHo2liz8LD2rgkS8sbApSjzwjDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413346/unnamed__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Summit E16 is stylus-compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pPIR02"&gt;The E13 Flip Evo is, as its name implies, certified through Intel’s Evo program. This means it’s met Intel’s various standards for top-performing Tiger Lake laptops, including responsive performance, quick boot time, all-day battery life, and other modern amenities like Thunderbolt 4 and Wi-Fi 6. MSI claims it “performs 10% higher than other 2-in-1 laptops of the same tier.” (I’ll have to test that claim for myself when I get my hands on a unit, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOU7VK"&gt;The E16 Flip looks to be more of a workstation device. MSI says it will include “the latest Nvidia graphics card” to lend a hand with content-creation tasks. It also comes with four microphones for conference calls. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ygfUcg9GZKh1NAzcS7X_PiAsNnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22413351/unnamed.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml80vK"&gt;Models support Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2, as well as PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukkvN9"&gt;Pricing and availability are still to be announced. The current Summit E13 Flip costs &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6454599&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsummit-e13-flip-13-4-2in1-touch-laptop-i7-1185g7-irisxe-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-win10-with-msi-pen-ink-black%2F6454599.p%3FskuId%3D6454599&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599.99&lt;/a&gt;, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see these two models somewhere above that range.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aptera and its solar car are back from the dead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mY4tg15gOqEyx_KK5tXWW-0huhk=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69061115/Aperta_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;And so is the government program that killed it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="R1bJMk"&gt;A decade ago, a small electric vehicle startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/3/2607224/aptera-motors-closes-its-doors-without-producing-its-space-age"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;. But now it’s back from the dead — and so is the government program that helped kill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcLOLf"&gt;This zombie company, called Aptera, is once again trying to sell people on a curious idea: an ultra-efficient three-wheeled electric vehicle powered, in part, by solar panels. And like a bad sequel, one of the villains from the first go-round is back, too: the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. The same program that famously saved Tesla from an early collapse also helped deliver the death blow to Aptera and a number of other startups along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj0SH0"&gt;Aptera is not the only would-be EV startup that died seeking money from the government in a post-recession world. In fact, one of them — Fisker Automotive — got the money and still keeled over. But Aptera is the only one so far to walk among us once again. It even has its original founders at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgQAdz"&gt;Now, this undead company finds itself in a much different world, one brimming with optimism — and cold hard cash — for electric vehicle startups. But one thing’s the same: the office that ran the DOE’s loan programs is back. And Aptera is ready for another shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoTVd-NWHBGj0RdR8t-vnzfSJn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410850/aptera.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VBeMH9"&gt;Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony founded Aptera in 2006, two years before Tesla started selling its first electric car, the Roadster. The pair came up with an idealistic vision of what one should be: something light, ultra-efficient, and futuristic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUXpmm"&gt;It was the kind of optimistic idea that was popular at the time in the tech industry. Their car was electric, and therefore made no emissions. The solar panels on top made it possible to gather electricity from the sun to power the climate system. It was relatively lightweight and sported just three wheels, meaning it took up no more space than it needed to — practically sacrilege in a pre-recession world full of SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPlKfS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original Aptera was dismissed by Detroit, but it found support in Silicon Valley&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DnwK3L"&gt;There was also what seemed like a great opportunity. General Motors had architected the most serious electric vehicle to date, the EV1. It not only abandoned the program in favor of its gas-guzzlers, but it literally crushed the EVs it took back from owners. Silicon Valley started training its attention on the transportation industry as a place that was ripe for disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1V9vp"&gt;A few other early EV startups shared this romantic view of EVs back then, sparking similarly strange designs. But even among its peers, Aptera’s EV stood out. NBC called it “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna21883886"&gt;Jetson-like&lt;/a&gt;.” General Motors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125288146359206959"&gt;called it a “novelty vehicle.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3t8CJX"&gt;While Detroit dismissed it, Aptera won over parts of Silicon Valley anyway. Google, for instance, backed it &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2008/07/23/googleorg-gives-electric-cars-a-push-with-investments-in-aptera-and-actacell/"&gt;through its philanthropic arm&lt;/a&gt; to the tune of a few million dollars. So did tech incubator Idealab. Part of Aptera’s plan relied on its vehicle being classed as a motorcycle to keep costs down — exactly the kind of regulatory arbitrage that Silicon Valley loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="(CARLSBAD) – The Aptera Typ–1 was designed from the ground up as an electric vehicle, and later as" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcLRR2Y4WXq-tqpTmdZchleLIio=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410870/563981881.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Aptera prototype in 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ql8UMx"&gt;All this attention was enough to help Aptera convince around 4,000 people to put down $500 deposits &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-01-23-aptera-rolls-out-first-pre-production-vehicle-promises-shipment.html"&gt;by the end of 2008&lt;/a&gt;. But the closer Aptera’s vehicle got to the road, the further the company strayed from that original vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mjQXh"&gt;The new board of directors paid “a ridiculous amount of money” to recruit a new executive team, Anthony told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and eventually picked a new CEO from Detroit named Paul Wilbur in September 2008. Fambro took a reduced role as the company’s CTO as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmMU1w"&gt;In December, just after he took over, the Department of Energy &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1070490_aptera-collapse-how-why-it-happened-a-complete-chronology"&gt;rejected Aptera’s application for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program&lt;/a&gt;. Electric vehicles were still viewed more as science experiments than proven products, so the program seemed like one of the safest bets a small startup like Aptera could make when it came to funding. The same program eventually gave out heaps of cash to Tesla, Fisker Automotive, and even Ford. But the DOE wasn’t evaluating three-wheelers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CO2Pr1"&gt;Wilbur decided to redesign Aptera’s vehicle to adhere to the same standards for passenger cars, in hopes of convincing the incoming Obama administration to reconsider the rejection. On top of the redesign, he wanted to create a hybrid variant and a new, more traditional product to be designed as well: a car with four wheels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mx59xL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The closer the vehicle got to the road, the further it strayed from the vision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLeHve"&gt;The DOE agreed to consider three-wheelers for the ATVM program in October 2009. At that point, Aptera was simultaneously redesigning its main vehicle, developing a four-wheeled option, and slogging through the application process for the ATVM loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl0wNa"&gt;Aptera’s efforts to raise outside money stalled in 2010. By that point, Wilbur had essentially bet the entire company on the support of the government. The ATVM program was its last hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QYNk6e"&gt;He nearly hit it big. Aptera got a commitment from the DOE for $150 million in 2011 — on the condition that the startup raise $80 million in the private markets. Wilbur and his team wore a path in the asphalt on Sand Hill Road. But the private funding scene was dry for automotive startups, especially with giants like General Motors having gone bankrupt. Aptera folded at the end of 2011 and sold off all its assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzX93Y"&gt;Fambro and Anthony were already gone. Reports at the time &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/02/steve-fambro-leaves-aptera/"&gt;said they were forced out by the board&lt;/a&gt;, though Anthony maintains he left the company to start battery company Flux Power in 2009. Fambro was officially done in early 2010, and Anthony admits now he “got frustrated much quicker than Steve did.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A revamped version of Aptera’s vehicle after Paul Wilbur took over as CEO in 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="92dcxV"&gt;“We had a production-intent vehicle ready. And unfortunately, the production plans hinged on the Department of Energy loan,” Anthony recalls. “Steve and I had left Aptera, and the new management team did not get that Department of Energy loan, so they really had no path forward. The economy was crumbling and people just weren’t willing to put money into esoteric ideas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YzAilS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ATVM program became a “poison pill”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lFfSHm"&gt;One former Aptera employee, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the company’s collapse, said the loan was a “poison pill” for the startup. “The DOE loans were the worst thing to happen to the EV industry in the 2009-2010 time period,” they said. “It became the only litmus test for whether you were a viable electric vehicle company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHGx5X"&gt;Aptera wasn’t alone — even Anthony’s next company took a hit. Flux Power was developing batteries to be used in other vehicles, but without access to funding, many of them died out. “The ATVM loan program screwed Flux [Power] as well,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7B1Uj"&gt;The Department of Energy handed out a life-saving loan to Tesla, as well as billions of dollars to major automakers like Ford and Nissan. But when startups like Fisker Automotive and solar company Solyndra defaulted on theirs, the program stalled. It hasn’t given out any new money since, despite there being more than $40 billion already appropriated. The ATVM program alone accounts &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program"&gt;for a $17.7 billion slice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He0ISE"&gt;“I think it’s sad that $17 billion are collecting dust,” Anthony says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HWrT0hwzNL1Vs2sa3jy_ygSX-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410915/d77790_64495187b92c4b8f8ac8116a21c52e2a_mv2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KE2gYd"&gt;“After the end of the first Aptera, I tried to just jettison it from my mind,” Fambro explained on a Zoom call in late December. Just a few weeks after leaving Aptera in 2010, Fambro said he already had a term sheet for his next company. He spent the next few years developing advanced hydroponic farms and running a clean tech fund for the royal family in Abu Dhabi but stayed close with Anthony. “Steve and I had always had it in the back of our minds that Aptera would be great to resurrect,” Anthony says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrLwPK"&gt;In the meantime, Aptera was being stripped for parts. The startup’s investors — Idealab, energy company NRG, Google, and others — sold Aptera’s intellectual property in December 2011. Aptera also auctioned off all of its other &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111208006176/en/Assets-of-Concept-Electric-Vehicle-Manufacturer-Aptera-Motors-to-Be-Auctioned-on-December-20-21-2011"&gt;assets&lt;/a&gt; in a liquidation sale, like &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111208006176/en/Assets-of-Concept-Electric-Vehicle-Manufacturer-Aptera-Motors-to-Be-Auctioned-on-December-20-21-2011"&gt;power tools, computer towers, and even the signs on the Carlsbad, California headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese automaker Zhejiang Jonway won the bidding war for the startup’s vehicles, equipment and tooling, and IP, and so those went to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcVdpK"&gt;Zhejiang Jonway eventually tried in 2013 to spin out &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2013/06/11/zaptera-says-aptera-usa-will-push-on-with-gas-electric-versions/"&gt;another independent company called Aptera USA&lt;/a&gt; that would make gas versions of the car in the US. It’s unclear if a new Aptera USA was ever even incorporated after Zhejiang Jonway’s announcement. The Chinese company never even filed to take over Aptera’s IP with the US Patent and Trademark Office, according to the government database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tv4X1P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Chinese company that bought the remains of the first Aptera never did much with them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UFpOfS"&gt;This left Anthony and Fambro room to resurrect their original vision. “There didn’t seem to be any real hurdles in restarting the business just because it had laid fallow for so long,” Anthony says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxJGdp"&gt;The pair decided to reanimate Aptera in 2019. Electric vehicles were no longer science fair ideas. Tesla was in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113987/tesla-q4-2019-earnings-results-profit-revenue-model-3"&gt;then-record year&lt;/a&gt; ahead of becoming the most valuable automaker on the planet, and the financial markets began throwing billions of dollars at companies working on electric vehicles. Other startups had even taken up Aptera’s original mission of trying to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744078/lightyear-one-solar-powered-electric-car-release-date-price-range-features"&gt;a solar-powered commercial EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNAf1O"&gt;This time around, though, the new Aptera wants to take the idea much further, as it claims the solar panels on the vehicle can provide as much as 45 miles of range per day — blowing way past simply powering the air conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qw641c"&gt;There are more than three square meters of photovoltaic cells on the roof that are nearly twice as efficient as the ones the original Aptera used, Anthony says. That capability, paired with a 100kWh battery pack and a shape that produces extremely low amounts of aerodynamic drag, could make it so that some owners never have to plug the new vehicle in to charge, according to Aptera. The startup refers to the car as having a 1,000-mile range and, in turn, refers to it as the “&lt;a href="https://wefunder.com/aptera"&gt;world’s first never-charge solar vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/teDuaCBhrRRySSY8AJp9jIsQUQ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410931/d77790_ecebc023f1c0469da186968a8353c67a_mv2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7MQc3s"&gt;These are staggering claims for any company, let alone a startup. When pressed, Anthony admits Aptera is painting a rosy picture, even for those lucky enough to bask in the Southern California sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WMRQot"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new Aptera is making some bold claims&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F47jgb"&gt;“If you have a job somewhere that has an open parking lot, and you can park [the vehicle] out in the middle of that parking lot, and get lots of sun, [you’ll be] very happy with how much energy you created that day,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwJAJX"&gt;The new Aptera vehicle features more modern trimmings, too. There’s a large Tesla-style touchscreen on the dashboard. It will use in-wheel motors to save space and weight. It will have an attractive price, between $26,000 at the low end and closer to $50,000 at the high end — another big promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHXALd"&gt;Anthony and Fambro didn’t just tweak the technology, though. They’ve also changed how they are financing their effort. They initially turned to a crowdfunding site known as &lt;a href="https://wefunder.com/aptera"&gt;WeFunder&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, which lets people contribute to the company in exchange for small equity stakes. Aptera raised some $200,000 in 2019 on WeFunder and roughly doubled that figure in 2020. Then, they mixed in some private funding and &lt;a href="https://www.aptera.us/post/aptera-closes-4m-series-a-round-and-takes-a-quarter-billion-in-orders"&gt;closed a $4 million Series A funding round in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCGSQw"&gt;In March, Aptera filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786471/000110465921033701/tm218422d1_partiiandiii.htm"&gt;raise another $50 million&lt;/a&gt;, again with a public-private mix. But this time, retail investors will have to go through Aptera’s website; the raise won’t be done on a crowdfunding platform. “We’re hoping that we can raise $20 million as quick as possible so we can get the wheels spinning to get into production,” Anthony says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRZxBR"&gt;More than anything, this hybrid approach to funding the new Aptera is about one thing: Anthony and Fambro want to hold on to power this time. “It’s very crucial for Steve and I to make sure we retain control of the company so we can build it sensibly,” Anthony says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RwKBMW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s new energy secretary immediately revived the DOE loan program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KLzsZ4"&gt;As Aptera started talking about its funding plans more publicly, though, there was a series of announcements from the incoming Biden administration. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who helped broker the recession-era auto industry bailout, was tapped to run the Department of Energy. And one of her first moves was to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ceraweek-usa-granholm/ceraweek-u-s-energy-secretary-ready-to-loan-40-bln-to-boost-clean-energy-idUSL2N2L11U5"&gt;revive the loan programs office&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96FNuw"&gt;The DOE’s loan programs were “a bit moribund over the past few years,” she &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-granholm-interviews-energy-loans-5ceef97a73fc04fe3cca75bf84e91327"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s “an amazing tool.″ Granholm said she will work to streamline the process, too, so that it’s easier for companies to apply than it was back when Aptera took its first shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHm7wD"&gt;Fambro and Anthony were expecting something like this; in fact, they had already hired a lobbyist and spent tens of thousands of dollars. Anthony says they’re pursuing a loan in the $100 million to $150 million range, but that it won’t be necessary in the near term. Anthony says they’d most likely use the money to make a four-wheeled Aptera vehicle — something that’s also back in the company’s sights after the trouble it caused a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjzDzH"&gt;The priorities may have shifted, but this is still a lot to take on for a startup. Aptera’s founders have a weird, exciting solar-powered three-wheeler; they’re thinking about designing a normal car; and they’re once again chasing federal funding. At least the landscape has totally changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="so5yEd"&gt;“I’m stoked. Honestly, I think the first time around for us was it was almost like the cosmos was training us for this time around,” Fambro said. “We’re stronger. We’re better prepared. We’ve got loads of experience under our belt, you know, globally. And so I think we’re far more ready for it now than we were the first time around.”&lt;/p&gt;
