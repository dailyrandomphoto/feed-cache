    <title>Apple’s Dr. Brain is a bold, genre-bending thriller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="dr. brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdSPZb0E9B9NJVm_kU2J-QnyLwI=/694x0:3147x1635/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100297/Dr_Brain_Photo_010302.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A decent Korean original series debut for the platform, helmed by a seasoned director&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Z1rZU1"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; stumbles through its world-building at times, there is something deeply bold and profoundly ambitious in this first Korean original series on Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; takes off as a six-episode thriller starring Lee Sun-kyun (of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; fame) as neuroscientist Dr. Koh Se-won. It’s an encouraging start for the streamer’s Korean debut, though the show doesn’t quite deliver on the promise of its fascinating premise and excellent cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFxyyD"&gt;We are first introduced to Dr. Koh as a young kid on the autism spectrum, struggling to understand emotions and relate to others. He is unfortunately labeled as a problem child in school, which becomes an enormous burden for his single mother. Bringing him to doctors, the (exorbitant) treatments offered don’t quite seem to work the way she hopes for. Growing up with a propensity to “take things apart to see what is inside,” Dr. Koh dives into brain research, which allows him to study the human mind and get a glimpse of how others experience the world. Presenting his research and experiments at conferences, he is portrayed as a relatively successful scientist — albeit one whose ideas are unsettling to his peers. This introduction then takes a dark, abrupt turn as Dr. Koh suffers a series of horrific personal tragedies in quick succession. Increasingly desperate to unearth what happened, he personally tests his research by undergoing “brain syncs” with the dead to pry open their memories for clues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8N3TH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; is a genre-bending piece of work, dancing between crime thriller, science fiction, and, most poignantly, a family drama. The series’ best work is in its portrait of grief, sketching Dr. Koh’s private moments as ones of anguish and gradual reckoning with his own flaws and missteps. There is a saying in academia that all research is in some part autobiographical and this rings true for Dr. Koh. His “brain sync” research becomes both a form of mourning and a type of searching, as he realizes that there is something more sinister behind the tragedies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="XHDPrQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eB9PW65kWFo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbU7oN"&gt;Lee Sun-kyun delivers an appropriately reserved performance, getting the balance just right between playing an aloof neuroscientist and a traumatized, bereaved man seeking answers. His colleague, Dr. Hong Nam-il (Lee Jae-won), blossoms over the series, portraying a depth of character that far outdoes what the script offers him. As police officer Lieutenant Choi, Seo Ji-hye (from the immensely popular &lt;em&gt;Crash Landing On You&lt;/em&gt;) offers a refreshing steadiness throughout the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wg7MNB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"},{"title":"Apple’s latest sci-fi drama Invasion starts out too dang slow","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgTp33"&gt;There are unshakeable marks of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; echoing through the six episodes, as characters wander through altered realities and layers of consciousness. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;is most intriguing when its characters are unsure whether other people they are seeing are real or figments from a glitchy brain sync. Although the show fumbles through the details of the brain sync mechanism, the central story of Dr. Koh’s search for truth and redemption is resoundingly coherent. Which makes it all the more disappointing that the more philosophical explorations in &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; — on neurodiversity, ethics in brain research, and the concept of the self — are half-baked. Additionally, its treatment of female characters feels disconcertingly underdeveloped. They’re often left with little agency, abruptly enter and exit the narrative, and are ultimately relegated as untidy footnotes. With its uneven pace over six episodes, there is a gnawing sense that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;could have been truly great if its supporting characters and theories were more deeply fleshed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irGFjO"&gt;For example, though it never examines this fully, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain &lt;/em&gt;hints at some of the most complex moral dilemmas in technology that we’re really only beginning to truly interrogate. It is gravely disturbing to see Dr. Koh lurking around the morgue to find a corpse to test out his brain sync technology or hook himself up with a cat (!!) in the name of (hopefully) solving a crime. There is a fine balance between being a user of technology and being used by technology. Here is where the concept of brain syncs in the show carries some real-life parallels. How much of ourselves do we share via technology — and do we even have control over what and how much is shared? What does privacy mean in this digital age? Can the methods of technological advancement be justified as long as the outcomes are “good”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dr. Brain" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DnTuAzAMvTWXfCYSFw9JFSheX0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988263/ATV_Dr_Brain_Photo_010104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfcGtw"&gt;These questions are all the more poignant given the fact that the show is backed by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. There is perhaps a meta-critique here somewhere about the relationship between Apple and its users and whether our lives have really been made better by its products. Perhaps the conclusion that the show offers us is one of stubborn ambivalence toward technology: Dr. Koh’s use of brain sync technology (somewhat ironically) allows him to experience the richness of life, in all of its emotions, joys and sorrows, more than he ever could without it. Yet, this comes at a cost. He sometimes suffers from an information overload and his personality changes when reality and technology start to blur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqzmld"&gt;Seasoned writer-director Kim Jee-woon has helmed critically acclaimed Korean classics like &lt;em&gt;The Good, The Bad, The Weird&lt;/em&gt; (2008) and Korea’s first Warner Brothers-funded film &lt;em&gt;The Age of Shadows&lt;/em&gt; (2016). There are flashes of brilliance throughout the series, particularly in its seamless, well-timed use of flashbacks — a storytelling tool that too often feels abused nowadays. On one level, his sleek transitions between past and present fittingly capture the unsettled mind of Dr. Koh. On another, these shifts in time provide an absorbingly suspenseful experience for the viewer, especially in the last few episodes. This works in the show’s favor, as Apple TV Plus will drop episodes of &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; one at a time, weekly through December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3jFg09"&gt;Based on the popular Korean webtoon of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; premiered on November 4th, coinciding with Apple TV Plus’ launch in the Korean market. Though Dr. Brain might feel like a slow start for Apple, it is perhaps helpful to remember that not too long ago, Netflix debuted its first Korean original series &lt;em&gt;Love Alarm&lt;/em&gt; to rather disappointing, less-than-illustrious reviews. However, the platform has since developed a prolific portfolio of Korean shows winning both critical and commercial acclaim, most notably with the breakout success of &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;. Despite its shortcomings, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Brain&lt;/em&gt; offers a promising, hopeful glimpse of Apple TV Plus’ vision for its future projects in Korea and a veritable challenge to other streamers in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook sued by defunct photo app Phhhoto on antitrust grounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JIzpnsYya8tj1F4AQB55JBCdIso=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70100270/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook sued by founders of defunct photo app Phhhoto for putting it out of business&lt;/strong&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B4wt1E"&gt;Defunct photo app Phhhoto is suing Meta, formerly Facebook, on antitrust grounds, claiming the social media platform feigned interest in working with it, but then copied its features and hid its name from search results, effectively driving it out of business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TapuwX"&gt;Phhhoto’s technology allowed users to capture five frames “in a single point-and-shoot burst,” which could be looped into a short video (a phhhoto) to be shared either on its platform or Instagram. Sound familiar? That’s because, according to Phhhoto, Facebook copied Phhhoto’s main feature and &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-boomerang-video-app"&gt;released it on its Instagram platform as Boomerang in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, after blocking Phhhoto from Instagram’s API and from being pre-populated in Instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni4nr7"&gt;“The actions of Facebook and Instagram destroyed Phhhoto as a viable business and ruined the company’s prospects for investment,” Phhhoto says in a complaint filed in US District Court on Thursday. “Phhhoto failed as a direct result of Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct. But for Facebook’s conduct, Phhhoto was positioned to grow into a social networking giant, similar in size, scope, and shareholder value to other social networking and media companies with which Facebook did not interfere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxNiD6"&gt;Phhhoto, which launched in 2014 and shut down in 2017, claims it had 3.7 million monthly active users at its peak, and celebrities including Beyoncé, Joe Jonas, Chrissy Teigen, and Bella Hadid were uncompensated users of the app, posting its content to their Instagram accounts. Phhhoto claims in its complaint that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom, and several other Facebook employees downloaded the app in August 2014 and examined its features. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mIO0qRIZq4XBFWsVWBjZ2i00Om0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988080/zuck_phhhoto2.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Phhhoto / court filing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phhhoto claims in a new lawsuit that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg examined its app in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NvyYRi"&gt;Bryan Hurren, then strategic partnerships manager at Facebook, reached out to Phhhoto in February 2015, telling the company it was “really awesome,” and offering to incorporate its tech into Facebook Messenger, according to the lawsuit. Phhhoto declined, but Hurren then offered to incorporate Phhhoto content into the News Feeds of Facebook users. After investing heavily in the project, Phhhoto says Hurren cited internal legal conversations that prevented the two companies from moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkiMk2"&gt;In March 2015, Instagram’s settings changed, so that users of Phhhoto were unable to find their friends on Instagram, the lawsuit claims. Phhhoto claims Hurren told its team at the time that the company was “upset that Phhhoto was growing in users through its relationship with Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow0KsL"&gt;Then, just as Phhhoto was about to launch the Android version of its app in October 2015, Instagram introduced Boomerang, which the lawsuit calls a “slavish clone” of Phhhoto. In March 2016, Phhhoto discovered that its content was being suppressed on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgVKXz"&gt;The company says its suspicions were confirmed in 2018, when UK’s Parliament released a &lt;a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf"&gt;cache of previously sealed documents&lt;/a&gt; as part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127230/facebook-data-documents-parliament-deals-zuckerberg"&gt;investigation into Facebook&lt;/a&gt;’s alleged anti-competitive and data-collection practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaG2EF"&gt;“This revelation provided the first link between Facebook’s earlier actions toward Phhhoto (here, cutting off API access) as part of an exclusionary scheme with the algorithmic suppression discovered in late 2017,” according to Phhhoto’s lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lgOo7"&gt;Phhhoto is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages. Joe Osborne, a spokesperson for Meta (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Facebook changed its name to Meta&lt;/a&gt; on October 28th), said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “This suit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QrTRA4"&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vnRqfq"&gt;Lime announced today that it raised $523 million in debt financing, a sign that investors are feeling more optimistic about the long-term survival of shared electric scooters in a post-pandemic world. Lime must be feeling more optimistic, too, because a spokesperson confirmed that the company plans on going public sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM6IaK"&gt;Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scooter-startup-lime-raise-new-funding-after-spac-setback-uber-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Lime was hoping to raise up to $200 million in convertible debt from Uber and other previous investors. The scooter company was also reportedly in talks with investment bank Evercore about going public via a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC, but &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;says those talks fizzled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV3isn"&gt;Now, Lime says that its most recent funding round was oversubscribed, with $418 million in debt financing led by Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, Fidelity Management &amp;amp; Research, Uber, and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management. The company also received a $105 million senior secured term loan facility from a private equity group at UBS O’Connor. (These bank loans are typically made to companies that have below investment-grade credit ratings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nsZbXx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime says that its most recent funding round was oversubscribed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VV805V"&gt;Lime is not releasing details about interest rates or anything else related to the terms of the deal, the spokesperson said. The company also declined to reveal whether it plans on going public by merging with a special acquisition company (SPAC) or a traditional initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8cavD"&gt;The past two years have been a rollercoaster for Lime and the shared scooter industry as a whole. The company’s ridership dropped 95 percent as a result of the pandemic. While the world was locked down, Lime made a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;crucial investment deal with Uber&lt;/a&gt; and others for $170 million to take over the ride-hailing company’s bike and scooter business Jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHMmiX"&gt;In the fall of 2020, the company was feeling more optimistic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;having hit the milestone of 200 million rides worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. Lime CEO Wayne Ting told a crowd of investors in November that for the first time the company was operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs, in 2021. (Being cash flow positive means Lime has more money going into the business at a given time than going out. But it’s not the same as having net income or being profitable after adjusting your earnings for interest and taxes, also known as EBIT.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFCm9G"&gt;Then the Delta variant hit, which led to more lockdowns and delayed reopenings. Now, a spokesperson wouldn’t confirm whether Lime was still on pace for a full year of profitability, even though its last two quarters were EBIDTA (earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization) profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0mIT9"&gt;Even though it has proven popular with riders, scooter sharing’s early years were marked by steep losses. Most companies relied on a hefty dose of venture capital to keep their operations afloat. The industry struggled to fix its unit economics, in which the purchase price for each scooter exceeded the amount of revenue it brought in before eventually breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nid79M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime wouldn’t confirm whether it was still on pace for a full year of profitability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5C4Pm4"&gt;The original scooters deployed by companies like Bird and Lime — mostly sourced from Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot — weren’t built for shared use, so they were prone to breakdowns, often within weeks of being rolled out. But over the last several years, the scooter companies have taken pains to roll out better, more durable scooters in order to increase the average life span and improve their unit economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuWHYs"&gt;Going public would certainly help raise cash in the near term, but it also carries big risks. Lime’s main rival, Bird, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;recently went public via a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; that valued the Santa Monica-based company at $2.3 billion. That deal just closed, and as soon as they were publicly listed, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/"&gt;shares in the newly merged company fell sharply&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o004cy"&gt;But while Bird relies on its business model of sending fleets of scooters to small operators to handle deployment and charging, Lime will likely rely on its scale and global status to attract investor interest. The company claims to be the top scooter operator in the US and Europe. It hit 250 million rides over the summer (recall it was at 200 million a year ago) and recently rolled out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575127/lime-next-gen-scooter-profit-quarter"&gt;fourth-generation version&lt;/a&gt; of its electric scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGplhu"&gt;“This oversubscribed round is a testament to the strong business we’ve built and the overwhelming confidence we’ve received from the financial community,” said Ting in a statement. “This investment will allow us to double down on our newest generation of e-bikes and e-scooters, as well as additional modes, to ensure people have reliable access to affordable, shared, carbon-free transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTjLTR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer says its antiviral pill reduces hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UmeQu_bI1-uS7dE2fwFVAvIoOA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099857/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rq77J7"&gt;Pfizer’s antiviral pill is highly effective at preventing people who catch COVID-19 from becoming seriously ill, the company said today &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizers-novel-covid-19-oral-antiviral-treatment-candidate"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. A clinical trial showed that the pill, which has the brand name Paxlovid, cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent for adults at high risk of developing severe disease when it was given within three days of symptoms appearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsFXH1"&gt;The company said it plans to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization “as soon as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5uJta"&gt;This is the second effective anti-COVID-19 pill. The first, developed by pharmaceutical company Merck, cut risk of hospitalization and death &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/covid-antiviral-pill-merck.html"&gt;by about half&lt;/a&gt;. The United Kingdom’s health agency authorized the Merck pill &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/health/uk-authorizes-merck-antiviral-molnupiravir-covid/index.html"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, and the FDA’s advisory committee is scheduled to discuss it &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-hold-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-merck-and-ridgebacks-eua-application-covid-19-oral"&gt;on November 30th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAOK6i"&gt;Pfizer tested its drug in a study that included 1,219 adults who tested positive for COVID-19, had mild or moderate symptoms, and who had at least one underlying medical condition that would put them at risk for a severe case of the disease (like diabetes or a lung condition). Participants were randomly assigned to either take a course of placebo pills or the active drug. Three people in the active drug group were hospitalized and none died. In the placebo group, 27 people were hospitalized and seven died. The data was announced in a press release and has not been published in a scientific journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkqd3V"&gt;The Pfizer treatment works by stopping the coronavirus from making copies of itself inside cells. It includes 30 pills taken over five days. Merck’s, which works in a similar way, requires 40 pills taken over five days. Both are &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22704265/merck-covid-19-antiviral-pill-molnupiravir-treatment-drug"&gt;cheaper than&lt;/a&gt; treatments like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176631/coroniavirus-antibody-treatment-doses-unused-warp-speed"&gt;monoclonal antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which also can keep people from becoming seriously ill. They’re also logistically easier to use — pills can be taken at home, while antibody treatments are given through an infusion at a health center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1Zs75"&gt;The challenge with antiviral treatments like the Pfizer pill is ensuring that people are able to access them in the short window when they’re most effective. If people aren’t able to get a COVID-19 test result or make it to a doctor within the first few days after they start feeling sick, they likely won’t be able to get the same benefits from the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nr1t2q"&gt;Medications taken after someone gets sick also aren’t a replacement for vaccines, which can prevent people from getting sick in the first place. But antiviral pills are an important tool to fight COVID-19. “I think getting an oral pill that can inhibit viral replication — that can inhibit this virus — is going to be a real game changer,” former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/health/uk-authorizes-merck-antiviral-molnupiravir-covid/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiPOwV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fake press release claiming Kroger accepts crypto reached the retailer’s own webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Bitcoin Cash logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GyVB1-soYz4vdW2pZ2eQTbhgHEA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099845/1234440443.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Thiago Prudencio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vco3YT"&gt;Cryptocurrency and blockchain news presents many headlines that are hard to believe, so when a seemingly authentic press release ties a major retail outlet to second-tier crypto, it can take a moment to find out the truth. That was the case with a fake “Walmart takes Litecoin” release in September, and again this morning as PR Newswire &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kroger-to-accept-bitcoin-cash-this-holiday-season-301417472.html"&gt;published an illegitimate announcement&lt;/a&gt; claiming Kroger will start accepting Bitcoin Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YA3gd4"&gt; Because Kroger’s webpage pulls in the releases from PR Newswire, the fake release actually appeared on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FKroger.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kroger.com&lt;/a&gt; until it was removed. Kroger has been linked to cryptocurrency but does not accept it as payment. A partnership &lt;a href="https://blog.lolli.com/earn-bitcoin-back-at-kroger/"&gt;announced with Lolli late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowed users of that rewards program to earn small amounts of Bitcoin back on purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97j63K"&gt;Kroger PR confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Bitcoin Cash release is fake and quickly issued a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WniJnZ"&gt;This morning a press release was fraudulently issued claiming to be The Kroger Co. that falsely stated the organization will begin to accept Bitcoin Cash. This communication was fraudulent and is unfounded and should be disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The price of Bitcoin Cash spiked briefly due to the hoax" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o2PJx1qvniAnlSFT0Tigv_hKtWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22988094/coinbase_bch_price.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The price of Bitcoin Cash spiked briefly due to the hoax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zsAkyY"&gt;In less than 15 minutes, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fbitcoin-cash&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765098%2Fkroger-bitcoin-cash-cryptocurrency-hoax-pump-dump" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Coinbase shows&lt;/a&gt; the price of Bitcoin Cash rose &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/bitcoin-cash-briefly-spikes-on-fraudulent-press-release/"&gt;nearly 5 percent&lt;/a&gt;, going from about $602 to $630, which was likely the point of the hoax. It returned to the previous level almost immediately, but whoever was behind the scheme may have netted a profit already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmlyDc"&gt;Bitcoin Cash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16075276/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-coinbase"&gt;arose from a contentious chain split in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, as its proponents made a “hard fork” from Bitcoin, claiming that cryptocurrency hasn’t addressed high transfer fees and block size limitations. Coinbase halted trading for a time under accusations of insider trading, while in the years since the value of Bitcoin Cash has not kept up with the massive spikes seen from Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro is selling for its lowest price yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPad Pro with the Liquid Retina XDR display" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lq8_4xTg1mDHuMbfOw-7-nj8J4I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099758/vpavic_210512_4592_0192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new $1,399 12.9-inch iPad Pro is selling for $1,249 instead&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7OxW8A"&gt;If you need a powerful iPad with plenty of storage and a gorgeous display, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932FH25J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWafjgPfUw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 512GB, Wi-Fi version of the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro for its lowest price yet. Normally $1,399, the retailer is selling it for $1,249 instead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In Dieter Bohn’s review&lt;/a&gt;, he deemed this the best and nicest iPad out there. Powered by Apple’s M1 processor, the 2021 iPad Pro is a speed demon and it comes with features like Thunderbolt connectivity, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, Apple Pencil support, as well as Face ID unlocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fd91ge"&gt;As we noted yesterday, if you’re looking for something cheaper and smaller, Apple’s 2021 11-inch iPad Pro (128GB, Wi-Fi) is also on sale, selling for $699 instead of $799 at at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVKgWMaDgM?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527112%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fgood-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YtmtDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845841"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Normally around $1,300 while on sale, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F324842746233%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22763370%2Fapple-ipad-pro-macbook-gopro-hero-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $1,100&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a four-year accidental extended warranty. Better yet, after you purchase, &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15376480-48-lg-oled48c1pub-4k-smart-oled-tv-100-ebay-credit-4-year-accidental-warranty-w-burn-in-coverage-1099-free-s-h-at-ebay?src=frontpage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;says that your account will be credited $100, so it’s like getting the TV for $1,000 flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="laDMPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOWsR"&gt;You can also save hundreds on an Intel-powered Apple laptop, if you’d prefer one over an iPad today. And even though it doesn’t come with the M1 processor, it’s still a fast, powerful MacBook in its own right. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mid-2020 13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, four Thunderbolt ports, and a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor for $1,500 instead of $1,999. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we praised this MacBook Pro’s keyboard and build quality, calling it a “competent, dependable laptop.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2O5aOt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VKBXx"&gt;For Android users who are eager to snag a folding phone, Amazon has a great deal on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3. Released just a few months ago in August, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 touts a more durable screen than its predecessors, with 120Hz refresh rate displays, support for the S Pen, and IPX8 water resistance. Its main drawback, usually, is that it can be very expensive, but today’s deal shaving $200 off makes it more affordable. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097CMYTLD?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is the selling the 256GB foldable phone for $1,600&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,800. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HGBG94S?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $80 extra&lt;/a&gt;, you can also add an S Pen case to your order. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TKYAPK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10820291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lDfUD"&gt;Best Buy is taking $200 off of one of the best Chromebooks you can buy, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $529 for the previous-gen model with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of SSD storage, and an Intel 10th Gen Core i3 processor, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfMWtFCPMfN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it now for $329&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we found this Chromebook outperforms many others when it comes to features, build quality, and performance. Although it lacks Intel’s 11th Gen processor and Thunderbolt 4 support, we found that it boasts slightly better battery life than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEq0RM"&gt;However, if you’d prefer the latest version with an Intel Evo-certified 11th Gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and Thunderbolt 4 support, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfM3aomFXkf?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22490339%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling that&lt;/a&gt; one for $529 instead of $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8hwmpR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730313"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKPznw"&gt;If you’re going on an adventurous vacation soon and want to take great photos and video clips, check out this GoPro Hero 9 deal. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; last year, we called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 GoPro Hero 9&lt;/a&gt; the “biggest, baddest action camera out there.” The portable action camera is capable of capturing 5K video and 23.6-megapixel photos, and it can also be used to record in a variety of settings, including underwater. Right now, the GoPro Hero 9 is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVPVzIXaMN" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $350, the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ElvxWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="seU8L7"&gt;Best Buy is taking $100 off of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVSQ4vPqZp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 32-inch UltraGear QHD Nano IPS display&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $500, you can buy the gaming monitor for $400 instead. This monitor features thin bezels and a 16:9 aspect ratio with a sharp 2560 x 1440 resolution. It’s fast, boasting a 165Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time, and it’s also compatible with Nvidia’s G-Sync adaptive sync technologies. We might see slightly lower prices come Black Friday, but those who are in the market for a capable 32-inch gaming market should check this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEwZtz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10846505"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Dune movie flushed away a chance to talk about wastewater</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VriNkg_6VeyrADmp6G5k6Kaci4=/0x0:5913x3942/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099618/rev_1_DU_10412rv4_High_Res_JPEG.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Stillsuits reclaim more than just sweat and tears&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tRxXMt"&gt;Nearly an hour into the new &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; film, our favorite colonizing scamps, the Atreides boys, are introduced to a Fremen technology staple that allows them to survive Arrakis’ harsh desert environment. In the original 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, the stillsuit is full-body attire that recycles potable water from literally every drop of moisture produced by the wearer, including sweat, tears, feces, urine, and even breath (it would also theoretically work as a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dune-stillsuits-maxi-pad/"&gt;period-recycling apparatus&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypCjLm"&gt;In 2021, it appears that Denis Villeneuve is not a fan of drinking recycled pee. “A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system,” explains Dr. Liet Kynes (played by Sharon Duncan-Brewster), the Imperial Ecologist tasked to work with House Atreides. “It cools the body and recycles the water lost to sweat. Your body’s movements provide the power. Inside the mask you’ll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.” In a later scene, after Paul and Jessica have a cathartic family cry in their Fremen tent — an efficient structure that works similarly to the stillsuit — Paul urges his mother to drink. “It’s recycled water from the tent,” he says, “sweat and tears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRHDQZ"&gt;A few criticisms of Villeneuve’s movie have been that it was too flat, too beige, too sanitized, and didn’t seize the opportunity to get sufficiently weird with the source material. I’m usually a simple moviegoer with simple needs. My umbrage with the new &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is far more basic: removing a real-life sustainable solution from a pioneering work of climate fiction is peepeepoopoo erasure, especially when our disintegrating planet has so little left to give us. It’s time to destigmatize recycled piss water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UQ6Mmt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dune review: a movie that puts an epic franchise ahead of its epic story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="UzwZE7"&gt;I first tried drinking recycled sewage water in 2005, when the Singapore government introduced &lt;a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/fournationaltaps/newater"&gt;NEWater&lt;/a&gt; to the population; the idea of recycling municipal wastewater has been around since the 1970s when it was clear that the country didn’t have enough clean water sources of its own. Most Singaporeans grow up acutely conscious of the fact that half the country’s potable water supply comes from &lt;a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/fournationaltaps/importedwater"&gt;an agreement with Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; that expires in 2061. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Re9bp8"&gt;“The PUB (Public Utilities Board), for many decades, sat down in meetings that are organized in community centers,” says &lt;a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/interdisciplinary/staff/ceciliatortajada"&gt;Cecilia Tortajada&lt;/a&gt;, a former adjunct senior research fellow at Singapore’s Institute of Water Policy who has advised numerous international environmental organizations and is currently based at the University of Glasgow. “And they would take notes of anything that referred to water and then bring it back to the planning table and to the policy table ... and this is how they found out that scarcity was a concern of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y1bngSxKOu1WA0FLt04ePxBYmWw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985791/rev_1_DUN_T2_0040r_High_Res_JPEG__1_.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EeLWLR"&gt;I couldn’t tell you whether NEWater tastes noticeably different from “normal” water, even with the preexisting knowledge of its origins, because 16 years later, I don’t care. I do remember, though, the jokes and outright disgust expressed at the time NEWater rolled out, but more importantly, how quickly everyone accepted it and moved on. When you grow up surrounded by constant ambient rhetoric about water scarcity, even in a hyper-efficient capitalistic wet dream like Singapore, recycled drinking water is just fine. What I do know is that I can turn on the tap, stick my head under it like a cartoon, and drink whatever comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmu6Iz"&gt;“I find it very progressive, very enlightening, the idea of using all the resources you have,” says Tortajada. “If you have fresh water, if you have the rainfall and you have somewhere to store it, that is the best option and the cheapest option,” she says. “But there are places where there is water scarcity, so what is the next option? You use the resources available.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="n15xlp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These innovations, many times, come out of bright ideas or out of necessity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7LauPy"&gt;Tortajada points out that when it comes to technological innovations, the United States is, more often than not, first. But in the world of recycled drinking water, it’s Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia, which built the first large-scale recycled drinking water system in 1968. Even today, Windhoek is still the only place in the world where recycled drinking water can be piped directly into people’s homes. &lt;a href="https://www.ocwd.com/gwrs/"&gt;In Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt; and Singapore, there’s still a “middleman” step where a percentage of recycled wastewater gets blended in with reservoirs and aquifers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDUURh"&gt;“These innovations, many times, come out of bright ideas or out of necessity,” Tortajada explains. As such, recycled drinking water is usually only accepted by the people who actually need it. If you hadn’t already guessed by now, the thought of drinking recycled wastewater — a varietal blend of strangers’ pee and poop — is too disgusting for many people to accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nA8z0S"&gt;Ching Leong, an associate professor at the Institute of Water Policy who specializes in “irrational environmental behavior,” unpacked the finer points of this particular sentiment in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/11/548"&gt;a 2016 paper&lt;/a&gt; that compared the resounding success of Windhoek with a failed water reclamation project in LA’s East Valley. “The ‘yuck’ factor has been found to be the only statistically significant factor in empirical studies variously defined as ‘psychological repugnance,’ ‘disgust,’ or ‘profound discomfort,’” she wrote. “Implementation of [recycled drinking water] is still rare, despite its existence for more than 40 years, and despite policy makers and international agencies lauding it as a sustainable option for water supply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJjKv9"&gt;It doesn’t help that much dystopian sci-fi and pop culture humor leans hard into this disgust. Kevin Costner in &lt;em&gt;Waterworld&lt;/em&gt; faces the ultimate mockery of being surrounded by ocean, yet must scavenge for clean water and use his own spit to water his sole plant. Survivalist Bear Grylls is best known for drinking his own urine as an act of survival (something that then-President &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obama-refuses-to-drink-his-own-pee-shows-his-human-side-on-bear-grylls"&gt;Obama declined to do&lt;/a&gt; on Grylls’ show), though the &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/05/is-it-a-good-idea-to-drink-urine-when-water-is-scarce.html"&gt;Army Field Manual&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t recommend it. Since 2009, NASA astronauts have used a Urine Processor Assembly that can reclaim &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/34688-recycled-astronaut-pee-boosts-deep-space-travel.html"&gt;75 percent of water from their urine&lt;/a&gt;; today the tech has improved to the point where astronauts can safely drink it, but space travel is still far from being a comfortable experience for the average person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Nb_FYKAJgy_Wg3CuizIk_XP9iI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985793/rev_1_DUN_T2_0092_High_Res_JPEG.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMz0Ex"&gt;It’s especially interesting to think about our collective cultural reaction to drinking pee-water within the context of Leong’s research on emotions. Recycled water is objectively one of the cleanest things on the planet and is held to extremely rigorous standards. Yet, we only really see fictional instances of it in dire situations where survival is paramount. Leong’s case study of the East Valley water recycling failure points to a fundamental failure in communication, as in this line of work, good information campaigns are critical to helping people understand and accept recycled drinking water. Tortajada holds up the PUB’s NEWater rollout as a success story where transparency was key — there was a carefully planned campaign and the government opened a visitor’s center where people can take a tour and try bottles of NEWater for themselves. Most importantly, it was always clear what NEWater is: recycled wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGOsTI"&gt;“[Recycled drinking water] is the best alternative we have,” Tortajada says. “Not the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;— is the &lt;em&gt;best &lt;/em&gt;alternative we have. Because acceptance also comes in terms of pricing. So you cannot produce a source of water that would be so expensive that people would have to choose between paying [for their children’s school] or having water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0q7if"&gt;Even if you aren’t falling over backward to drink recycled sewage, you should probably know that it’s just really goddamn clean. “It is through recycling that you get the cleanest water,” Tortajada says, explaining that the PUB does double the number of quality checks than the standard parameters. According to her, water today is more polluted than ever, and that most people prefer bottled water despite the fact that the quality of bottled water often tests poorly compared to tap water in developed cities (and in some cases, bottled water is simply &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/truth-about-tap"&gt;repackaged tap water sold without oversight&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FgBzPD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Fremen relationship with water is marked by respect, practicality, and a hint of subdued reverence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn8MCZ"&gt;As to whether pop culture plays a significant role in the general public’s acceptance of recycled water, Tortajada says yes. “It depends on how communication is managed,” she says, pointing to failed projects in Queensland, Australia and San Diego where people weren’t given enough information, the public balked, and the projects were canceled. Within these sentiments are threads of classism, exceptionalism, and a deeply ingrained idea of what near-future dystopia looks like. For instance, in Leong’s East Valley case study, the strong “yuck” factor was associated with a sense of social justice — the perception that wealthier west LA would be getting “good” water, while poorer people were left with toilet water. Wildly fictional narratives in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d605rM0U3x0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fury Roa&lt;/em&gt;d&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIfMAhK7Boo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tank Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aren’t quite as silly when real-life cartoon villain CEOs claim that &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/waterbarons/water-and-politics-fall-suharto/"&gt;water should be privatized&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/waterbarons/cholera-and-age-water-barons/"&gt;corporations take advantage of corrupt governments to control clean water supplies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YXozG"&gt;Public acceptance is a problem for governments, policymakers, and science communicators, but it should also be addressed in the softer, subtle language of film, literature, and television. On the cultural front, perhaps it’s time we also shifted away from thinking of recycled toilet water in a dystopian context into one about positive long-term sustainability. The Fremen relationship with water is marked by respect, practicality, and a hint of subdued reverence for its properties, even when it’s been recycled from poop collected in your stillsuit’s thigh pads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="062m0Q"&gt;Like Paul Atreides, his cursed descendants, and even the Bene Gesserit, long-term planning seems to be the name of the game when you want people to accept an unpalatable reality. The real narrative of &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is an eons-long cycle of reshaping a planet and toying with inevitability, with a lot of proselytizing and preaching in between. We don’t have the luxury of that kind of time, nor do we have magic spice powers to make anything happen. But in the parlance of Leto Atreides — lord of air and sea power and would-be harnesser of desert power — perhaps the trick to conquering water scarcity is actually toilet power, and we need to stop being weird about it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Code suggests Google’s folding Pixel will return to 12-megapixel camera next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UDdpgPW5i6DLdApNvtrnMrWNRs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099537/dbohn_210820_4722_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhPdxC"&gt;Google’s rumored foldable device could release next year with similar camera hardware to what older Pixel phones used prior to this year’s big Pixel 6 overhaul, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Reports about the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;first emerged this summer&lt;/a&gt;, at which point it was expected to launch before the end of the year. Now the device, whose codename appears to have changed from “Passport” to “Pipit,” seems to be on track for a launch in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD9huF"&gt;These latest details have emerged thanks to code discovered in the Google Camera app. In particular, they suggest that the foldable will use a 12.2-megapixel IMX363 sensor for its main camera. That suggests the foldable won’t be equipped with the same 50-megapixel Samsung GN1 camera sensor Google used on this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the IMX363 is the sensor Google used for the Pixel 3 through 5. Its lower resolution suggests the foldable might struggle to match the excellent camera quality of the Pixel 6 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z77dsh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google switched to a 50-megapixel main sensor with the Pixel 6&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwxnjy"&gt;Aside from the main sensor, the code snippets suggest the Pixel foldable’s other cameras will be more in line with the Pixel 6. There’s a 12-megapixel IMX386 that’s expected to handle ultrawide shots and two 8-megapixel IMX355 sensors for its selfie cameras. Two selfie cameras appear to be necessary to allow selfies to be taken while the foldable is both open and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sfjZd"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, it’s not uncommon to see companies equip foldables with less powerful camera hardware than their flagships. The recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, for example, had a 12-megapixel sensor rather than the 108-megapixel sensor Samsung used in the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But it might be a disappointment for anyone expecting Google’s rumored foldable to match the camera quality of its latest flagships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duYy3l"&gt;A release date of next year makes sense for the foldable given what we know about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;Android 12L&lt;/a&gt;, the upcoming Android update that’s due to launch early next year and is designed to offer a range of improvements for devices with larger screens, including foldables. The update, which has previously been referred to as Android 12.1, also contains code suggesting Google might have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683566/google-jumbojack-foldable-passport-android-12-1-code-discovery"&gt;second foldable device in development&lt;/a&gt; under the codename “Jumbojack.” It’s unclear when, or even if, this second foldable may be released.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’s latest overkill gaming phones arrive in Europe with up to 18GB of RAM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwUsM0jHvmwjR7mNiHB8BMW66kI=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70099241/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro, which has a small display on its rear.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dPFt5t"&gt;Asus has announced pricing for the ROG Phone 5S series in Europe, following their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630283/asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features"&gt;launch in Taiwan in August&lt;/a&gt;. The ROG Phone 5S costs €999 for 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, while €1,099 gets you a step-up model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The top of the line 5S Pro has an excessive 18GB of RAM and the same 512GB of storage and retails for €1,299. Meanwhile in the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/asus/158977-asus-rog-phone-5s-pro-specs-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket-Lint&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the 16GB model will cost £999, and the 18GB Pro model will set you back £1,099, but there’s no mention of pricing for the 12GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhmTIR"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S and 5S Pro are functionally minor updates to the ROG Phone 5 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; that Asus released earlier this year. They have a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus processor and their screens have a more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate (their 144Hz refresh rates are unchanged), but the core specs remain the same. They still have 6.78-inch 1080p displays, 6,000mAh batteries, and triple-rear camera array with 64-megapixel main sensors. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gJJAmG"&gt;Although European pricing for the phones has now been announced, exact release dates seem to vary from country to country. In the UK, for example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fuk%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus’ online store&lt;/a&gt; currently doesn’t offer links to preorder the phones. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ffr%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FAll-series%2Ffilter%3FCategory%3DGaming-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765036%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-europe-launch-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In France&lt;/a&gt; the 16GB model of the ROG Phone 5S is available to buy now, but the 12GB and 18GB RAM variants are due to ship on November 19th. We’re yet to hear about any US release plans for the new phones.&lt;/p&gt;
