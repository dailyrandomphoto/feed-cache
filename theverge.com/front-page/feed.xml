    <title>Pfizer vaccine gets green light from FDA committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Food And Drug Administration Headquarters In Maryland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jISL6MwrWzmsRrv8_j6BoM1iijw=/0x0:5741x3827/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493778/1227710766.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXzHxE"&gt;An independent committee of experts recommended Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccine for people over the age of 16. Now, the FDA will decide whether to follow that recommendation. The agency could announce a decision within days. If they do authorize the vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; could begin receiving the shots almost immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3oZPu"&gt;The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met all day to review data on the vaccine, discuss plans for distribution, and outline plans for continued research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yaHet"&gt;FDA scientists published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163146/covid-vaccine-fda-review-safe-effective-time-pfizer-biontech"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about the vaccine on Tuesday, which analyzed data from the pharmaceutical companies and found that the vaccine was safe and 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. Data from the clinical trial, which included over 43,000 participants, was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;em&gt; New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;on Thursday and reported the same findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxlem1"&gt;In addition to the recommendation, the committee meeting also outlined ways researchers will continue to study the vaccine after it is authorized. The initial trial was in tens of thousands of people, enough to understand how well it works and how safe it is — but the vaccine will eventually be given to hundreds of millions of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTwJq6"&gt;“Despite the completely appropriate size and scope of the trials, it’s always important to monitor vaccines post licensure and post authorization,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a presentation to the committee on Thursday. “And that’s especially true with COVID-19 vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WFCqu2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s always important to monitor vaccines post licensure and post authorization”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ysu66"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA will track the vaccine’s safety with multiple monitoring systems, including some focused on residents in long-term care facilities and people in the military. Pfizer and BioNTech will also monitor the safety of the vaccine. The FDA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlecGaffney/status/1337127752412110848"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the companies to include anaphylactic reactions as part of the risks they monitor, after two people had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine-idUSKBN28J1D1"&gt;allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt; after receiving the vaccine in the United Kingdom this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHC0Kw"&gt;Messonnier outlined priorities for continuing to track the vaccine’s ability to protect against COVID-19. In the first few months, experts will watch to see if the vaccine appears to prevent disease as well in the real world as it did in the clinical trials. They’ll also track whether the vaccine can prevent infection with the coronavirus, or transmission of the virus, not just symptomatic disease. Pfizer said during the meeting that it’s collecting data that will show if the vaccine prevented asymptomatic infections, and that it’ll have that analysis in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znQE9M"&gt;“We have data not from humans but from non-human primate studies that would argue that the vaccine does prevent infection,” Kathrin Jansen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dry3ki"&gt;The committee also discussed the tricky question of whether Pfizer and BioNTech should tell people who were in the placebo group of the clinical trial that they were in that group, and offer them the vaccine. That would let everyone in the trial get the benefits of vaccination but would cut off the drug company’s ability to collect placebo-controlled data on the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t56t4r"&gt;Pfizer &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144337/download"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; offering the vaccine to people in the placebo group either six months after their second trial dose or when they’re eligible to receive it under the FDA’s authorization. The first group in the US eligible for vaccines under the CDC’s recommendations will be health care workers. There would be enough participants left in the placebo group even if health care workers in the trial took a vaccine to continue the study until the next wave of people became eligible, William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sPVQE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYKCMU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUyHRS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook won’t make employees get a COVID-19 vaccine before returning to the office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/com650mbRguhd21S4zE3AoXvqSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493746/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0417stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5b7AkW"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday during an all-hands meeting that they will not be required to get vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine to return to the office once the social media giant begins reopening its facilities, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/mark-zuckerberg-tells-facebook-staff-they-wont-need-a-vaccine-to-return-to-work?via=twitter_page"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Facebook employs more than 50,000 corporate employees, a vast majority of which have been working from home since the beginning of the year. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1337124112561438720"&gt;independently verified the news&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXJFsk"&gt;The company’s offices have been closed since March, and in May, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;announced a permanent work-from-home policy&lt;/a&gt; that gave employees the freedom to choose where they work going forward. But the plan since at least August of this year has been to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357768/facebook-extends-remote-work-employees-july-2021-covid-19"&gt;reopen its offices by July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which is when Facebook employees must declare a permanent residence and opt to either return to work in an office or choose to become a fully remote worker, a decision that may involve decreases in pay depending on where the employee resides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVaLoJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite this, he expressed confidence in the vaccines. He also said that some employees have already started to return to offices abroad in places w/ low COVID numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He did not mention contract content mods who were recently forced to come back in some US offices.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Mac   (@RMac18) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1337128409776881664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwVPja"&gt;Throughout its communication regarding remote work, Facebook has said little of how it plans to reopen its offices and, more importantly, what it may require of employees to begin returning to work. Zuckerberg’s internal announcement today marks the first of such declarations, and it makes him the first major tech CEO to stake out a position on whether employees will be required to get vaccinated to return to office work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhMGtJ"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Embrace your inner yellow blob with Headspace’s new Netflix meditation show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/za36vKyxDo4Q_z1xm09Okg3s5bE=/273x0:1622x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493738/headspace_netflic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Headspace and Netflix are teaming up for a new show on meditation&lt;/em&gt; | Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPVv9g"&gt;Meditation apps and streaming services have been booming of late, with people locked down and stressed out during the coronavirus pandemic, so the next logical step was for meditation apps to launch streaming shows. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458335/new-trailers-resident-evil-truth-seekers-queens-gambit-netflix-amazon"&gt;Calm launched &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;World of Calm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max in October, and Headspace has just announced a &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-headspace-team-up-for-three-original-series"&gt;three-series deal with Netflix&lt;/a&gt; that kicks off next month with the &lt;em&gt;Headspace Guide to Meditation&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNmhOi"&gt;Anyone who’s used Headspace will recognize the voice of co-founder Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk who advises you to “be kind to your mind.” The first series of eight episodes launches January 1st and will teach the benefits of the practice and provide guided meditations. The &lt;em&gt;Headspace Guide to Sleep&lt;/em&gt; and an interactive experience will come later in 2021. (Disclosure: the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Headspace&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Netflix series is produced by Vox Media, parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XLTSX3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H77PL7SlI1M?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3Ntbt"&gt;Headspace has made its content free for a variety of audiences during the pandemic, providing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181773/headspace-free-health-care-provider-public-health"&gt;premium subscription content&lt;/a&gt; to health care providers and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209831/headspace-app-new-york-free-content-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENYauo"&gt;Helping people relax their brains has been big business during the pandemic, with downloads for Calm and Headspace surging. Earlier this week, Calm raised a new round of funding, putting the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/calm-hits-2-billion-value-with-lightspeed-goldman-tpg-backing"&gt;company’s valuation around $2 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeMDQB"&gt;The Calm series features episodes “designed to transform your feelings through enchanting music, scientifically engineered narratives, and astounding footage,” with voiceovers from celebrities like Mahershala Ali, Idris Elba, Keanu Reeves, Nicole Kidman, and Kate Winslet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cPc5m"&gt;The Headspace show will feature 20-minute sessions, with Puddicombe’s voice guiding listeners through different mindfulness techniques to focus on things like sleep and stress with animations and music. It will be subtitled and dubbed in 30 languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Slv9K"&gt;Just look how calm that little yellow blob creature looks in the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QREpan"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s new bundle will offer ad-free Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus for $18.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Crqp0yJWUhESjleSUWNifQ3K7II=/0x35:1396x966/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493610/disney_plus.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SJLq2j"&gt;Disney has announced a new combined bundle for its streaming services, which will offer Disney Plus, ad-free Hulu, and ESPN Plus for $18.99, a six-dollar increase over the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757626/disney-plus-espn-hulu-bundle-price-date-streaming-service"&gt;existing $12.99 streaming bundle&lt;/a&gt; (which only offers a version of Hulu with ads).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMNwwG"&gt;That $6 price increase is the same as the difference between the standalone version of Hulu’s service with ads ($5.99 per month) and the ad-free version ($11.99 per month), so customers aren’t necessarily getting a deeper discount, but the pricing does mean that customers who prefer the ad-free version of Hulu will be able to take advantage of the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6D4v1"&gt;Purchased separately, Disney Plus ($6.99 per month), ESPN Plus ($5.99 per month), and Hulu without ads ($11.99 per month) would cost $24.97, so the new bundle would save customers $5.98 each month. Or, taken another way, the bundle means that subscribers to Disney Plus and Hulu’s ad-free service can effectively get ESPN Plus for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpYKui"&gt;The new bundle should be available sometime in January. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney unveils Star, its Hulu replacement for international Disney Plus subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3KHGidpv5oRc1jzOlJ5mO2ZXvQ=/72x0:975x602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493583/atlanta.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSWFVO"&gt;Star, Disney’s international answer to Hulu, will roll out in certain European countries, Canada, and New Zealand beginning on February 23rd, the company announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9IYqm"&gt;Star is a free tier within Disney Plus for subscribers in Europe, Canada, and New Zealand that will be fully integrated into Disney Plus. It will be accessible as the sixth brand tile in the app. Essentially, this will carry a number of shows from Disney’s other non-main franchise brands. That means shows from FX and movies from 20th Century will be available to stream. People will be able to opt in to choose if they want to watch shows with higher age ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bzY1u"&gt;The company is also introducing Star Plus to Latin American subscribers. The new streaming service will carry Disney-owned entertainment from its top brands but will also carry ESPN Plus and ESPN content. This is one of Disney’s biggest pushes into making a streaming service carry linear sports content. Star Plus launches in June 2021. The news comes as Disney announced it has more than 137 subscribers across its various streaming platforms, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;86 million on Disney Plus alone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLRtxf"&gt;Disney CEO Bob Chapek first talked about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354712/disney-star-streaming-service-international-expansion-hulu-plus-abc-fx-fox"&gt;Star in early August&lt;/a&gt;, announcing plans to launch an international streaming service that would effectively become a more general entertainment platform similar to Hulu. Unlike Hulu, Star won’t carry titles from other studios. Instead, Star will only carry TV shows and films from ABC, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, and 20th Century Studios. The streamer will also have localized content for various countries in which it operates. Chapek believes that adding Star will “enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZXlvJ"&gt;“In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror our successful Disney Plus strategy by using our Disney Plus technical platform, bringing in content we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own, which is, of course, Star,” Chapek told analysts at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YpwgzO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Absent from Chapek’s announcement were details about what is happening with Hulu&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SqOJmr"&gt;Disney Stars Studio is a big brand overseas. When Disney acquired Indian conglomerate Star India and its subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273142/disney-fox-acquistion-final-hulu-marvel-streaming-21st-century"&gt;streaming service Hotstar in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the company rebranded the streamer to Disney Plus Hotstar. Now, Star is known as Disney’s Star India. Having “Star” become the international brand name, on top of Disney Plus, makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j21FS"&gt;Absent from Chapek’s announcement were details about what is happening with Hulu. Prior to Chapek announcing Star in August, the plan was to bring Hulu to international markets. That was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123168/hulu-international-2021-disney-plus-streaming-bundle-rollout"&gt;case up until February 2020&lt;/a&gt; under former CEO Bob Iger. If Hulu remains a domestic-only streaming service, it can only amass so many subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4P123"&gt;Chapek pointed out in August that “Hulu has no brand awareness outside of the US.” But is Hulu still a priority for Disney? The company is facing a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/media/disney-hulu-comcast.html"&gt;multibillion-dollar payout&lt;/a&gt; to Comcast in 2024 and, while Disney is seeing “very, very strong demand for advertising on Hulu,” according to chief financial officer Christine McCarthy, Hulu’s place in the overall Disney streaming empire is a bit of a conundrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avAXiD"&gt;Since former CEO Randy Freer stepped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117502/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-disney-plus-kevin-mayer-dtc-espn-marvel-studios#:~:text=Randy%20Freer%20is%20stepping%20down,business%20under%20its%20own%20executives."&gt;down at the end of January&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Hulu executives have left the company. Disney executives have been brought in to oversee the service. Now, Hulu will be overseen in part by Kareem Daniel, who heads up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514728/disney-streaming-reorganization-plus-espn-hulu-studios-movies-network-tv-shows-pandemic"&gt;Disney’s new Media and Entertainment division&lt;/a&gt; and is in charge of all things streaming. Chapek and Daniel made it clear this afternoon that Star is a big part of Disney’s future — whether Hulu is remains unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKkU41"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="paX4aO"&gt;Disney has announced that it will bring a lot of original content directly to its Disney Plus streaming service over the next few years. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Disney/status/1337152322653351936"&gt;is bringing&lt;/a&gt; “roughly” 10 Marvel series; 10 &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; series; 15 Disney live-action, Disney Animation, and &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/705883/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; series; and 15 all-new Disney live-action, Disney Animation, and Pixar features to Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2HUhU"&gt;The commitment to launch so many shows directly on Disney Plus speaks to Disney’s confidence in the service in the long term. Disney announced that &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;will debut on Disney Plus as a Premier Access title the same day it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;hits theaters on March 5th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The company dipped its toes in launching directly on Disney Plus with the premiere of the live-action remake of &lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, and Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt; is set to premiere on the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;on December 25th&lt;/a&gt;. The news also follows WarnerMedia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;bombshell announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it would be bringing all of its 2021 films to HBO Max the same day they premiere in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzNPuE"&gt;Disney Plus launched just over a year ago, and it already has more than 86 million subscribers, a figure the company also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165579/disney-plus-86-million-subscribers-netflix-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. That growth has been in part fueled by the success of the mega-hit &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/705878/9358?sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a series airing only on Disney Plus that is currently in its second season. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney to release Raya and the Last Dragon on Disney Plus and in theaters on the same day </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4IPsC5-X4udmfIgRYNVtganO8IQ=/86x0:1484x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493513/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_4.50.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cq8599"&gt;Disney will release &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;as a Premier Access title the same day it hits theaters on March 5th, 2021, the company announced today. Disney did not provide a price for the movie, but when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21407106/disney-mulan-release-date-free-streaming-subscribers-december-window"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;shifted to Premier Access&lt;/a&gt;, it charged $30 for the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKdZqv"&gt;Similar to WarnerMedia, Disney needs to have a continuous stream of new releases to keep people subscribed for $7 a month and bring in new subscribers. Also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;like WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt;, most of the movies that Disney is moving to Disney Plus, bypassing a theatrical release, were box office gambles to being with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Pe6pQc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welcome to the Kingdom of Kumandra. Raya and the Last Dragon is coming to theaters and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt; with Premier Access on March 5, 2021. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyRaya?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyRaya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/tF94qRTo0E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tF94qRTo0E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney (@Disney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Disney/status/1337152641135239169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vnk6El"&gt;Before Disney Plus, Disney had no choice but to bring them to theaters or release them as straight-to-video titles, which wasn’t a great option. Now, those movies can be used to bolster Disney Plus and give subscribers something new to watch. CEO Bob Chapek said Disney saw enough of a performance to justify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;continuing the release strategy&lt;/a&gt; and plans to release more films in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIiohB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus hits 86 million subscribers in a little over one year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iMbwmx3LsqcoPn0bjFoFqt1QBp8=/93x0:648x370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493362/baby_yoda.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MfE15d"&gt;Disney Plus has amassed more than 86 million subscribers since launching in November 2019, CEO Bob Chapek announced. Disney also announced that Hulu has reached 38.8 million subscribers and ESPN Plus has amassed 11.5 million subscribers. Disney’s streaming services now have a combined total of 137 million subscribers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rM2r8D"&gt;“Disney Plus has exceeded our expectations,” Chapek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4lpK0"&gt;Disney Plus’ latest batch of subscribers came amid its expansion into parts of Latin America in late November. Just before the rollout, Chapek announced that Disney Plus had amassed just under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;75 million subscribers globally&lt;/a&gt;. With its new milestone, Disney has accomplished in one year more than executives originally hoped to accomplish by 2024. To put it another way, Disney accomplished in one year what Netflix took several years to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eGqiF"&gt;Prioritizing streaming as a core part of Disney’s business is paying off for the House of Mouse. Executives have made moves over the course of the last 10 months that seem to have cemented their faith in Disney Plus: &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;moved from a theatrical &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;title to Disney Plus for free&lt;/a&gt; (alongside &lt;em&gt;Artemis Fowl &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508491/pixar-soul-disney-plus-release-date-christmas-holidays-streaming-theaters"&gt;Pixar’s upcoming &lt;em&gt;Soul&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;kicked off Disney’s Premier Access program, which charges an additional fee for new films, and &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian’&lt;/em&gt;s second season&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;leaped into some of the most-watched programming in the United States, according to Nielsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KP88Jb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To put it another way, Disney accomplished in one year what Netflix took several years to do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UnPr4O"&gt;Major shareholders like Dan Loeb are publicly asking Disney to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/dan-loeb-calls-on-disney-to-suspend-dividend-invest-it-in-disney-plus.html"&gt;go in even more on streaming&lt;/a&gt;, and Disney is listening. The company is planning to forgo its semiannual dividend payout to shareholders to invest in more content for its streaming platforms, most meaningfully Disney Plus. As Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris wrote in a note prior to Disney’s fourth quarter earnings in November, the company is making “streaming its primary mechanism for monetization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ECwOb"&gt;2021 is shaping up to be a good year for Disney Plus. More live-action adaptations, like &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pinocchio, &lt;/em&gt;are &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/disney-plus-moving-pinocchio-cruella-peter-pan-and-wendy-no-theaters-1234619134/"&gt;reportedly heading&lt;/a&gt; to Disney Plus, Marvel Studios’ series will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562411/wandavision-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-studios-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany"&gt;finally start premiering&lt;/a&gt;, and there will likely be new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; things to look forward to. On top of potential new series from Pixar and Disney’s own live-action divisions, Disney is going to want to add as much to its service as possible — especially as WarnerMedia prepares to bring Warner Bros.’ entire slate to HBO Max and compete for people’s wallets and attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RGLoL"&gt;Disney Plus is still expanding, and it’s still got a long way to go. Netflix likely has more than 200 million subscribers worldwide at this point. But more than 86 subscribers in just a little over a year is pretty impressive. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft will let parents block kids from playing Xbox until their homework is done</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WGZXu5XYYyo0Zd45edqO0qhQY0=/0x34:911x641/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493291/Family_Settings_App_Hero_Img_12_9_updated.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="66qb6I"&gt;Microsoft is adding &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/xbox-family-settings-app-updates/"&gt;new screen time and game purchasing controls&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Family Settings app in anticipation of a gaming-filled holiday at home. Microsoft originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271922/xbox-family-settings-app-screen-time-limits-windows-10"&gt;launched the app in preview&lt;/a&gt; during the summer, and it released the final version in September. But the company is now adding in more features so parents can better manage their children's playtime on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvgsOS"&gt;Alongside the current ability to set and manage the amount of time kids are able to play on their Xbox, parents can now also use Pause Screen Time to temporarily block an account as motivation to finish homework or hang out with family members. The block can be removed any time via the app or automatically turned off at the end of the day. If the blocked account tries to play anything while the block is on, they’ll be shown a notification informing them their screen time is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U3cq8"&gt;Microsoft is also adding in some controls over purchases that were previously available directly on Xboxes and PCs. With the “Ask to Buy” setting turned on in the Xbox Family Settings app, when a kid goes to buy something from the Xbox Marketplace, their parent will be notified in the app from which they can read more about the game and approve the purchase. With the setting turned on for an account, only purchases made with a gift card or the remaining account balance will go through without approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1WJZp"&gt;The Xbox Family Settings app is available for download now on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxfamily&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xbox-family-settings/id1507406707"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2020 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2020 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2020 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2020. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2020 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 touchscreen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Un0RYw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air is the best laptop you can buy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;The 2-in-1 laptop to buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ff7WtW"&gt;A gorgeous 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BGSdq5"&gt;The Spectre x360 is a premium-level 2-in-1 Windows laptop with the latest processor options from Intel, a vibrant touchscreen, and more port options than are found on other laptops in this segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL9pqG"&gt;The x360 weighs less than three pounds and is about two-thirds of an inch thick when closed, which makes it very easy to travel with. The latest model has a smaller footprint than before, thanks to shrunken bezels above and below the screen, but it still maintains a full-size keyboard and spacious trackpad. In addition, it provides both facial and fingerprint biometric authentication, so you can choose which way you prefer to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQyU1"&gt;HP updated the trackpad drivers it uses in the latest model to Microsoft’s Precision set and the experience is improved over the older versions to the point where it’s no longer an issue. The x360’s trackpad is now right up there with the best Windows trackpad options (which are still a tick behind what you get on a MacBook) in terms of scrolling, multifinger gestures, and palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msO0V8"&gt;The biggest argument against the x360 is that it has a 16:9 display, as opposed to the 16:10 or 3:2 screens you’ll find on Dell or Microsoft’s computers. Those taller aspect ratios are much better for productivity work, whether that’s working in two documents side by side or researching on the web without having to scroll as much. But unless you are very particular about your screen’s aspect ratio, most people won’t find this to be a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 15 is one of the best laptops for video editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telaZa"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE proves that you don’t need to break the bank for a great gaming experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xLW8VK"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
