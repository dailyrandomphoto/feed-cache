    <title>India reportedly warns Twitter of ‘unintended consequences’ if it fails to follow new rules</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K2BIW6"&gt;India’s government has told Twitter it could face “unintended consequences” if it fails to comply with the country’s new social media rules, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-twitter-comply-with-it-rules-or-face-unintended-consequences-2021-06-05/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; India’s technology minister wrote in a June 5th letter to Twitter that the company’s responses to previous government letters about the new rules did not confirm whether Twitter was in full compliance, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f38IJN"&gt;Under India’s Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/whatsapp-reportedly-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-end-privacy.html"&gt;took effect in May&lt;/a&gt;, social media companies could be subject to legal action if they fail to follow the code’s provisions, which are aimed at regulating the platforms’ content. The new rules call for platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp to remove content within 36 hours of receiving a legal order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBellz"&gt;The rules also require the companies to have a grievance officer who acknowledges users’ complaints within 24 hours, a chief compliance officer, and a contact person who would be available to law enforcement agencies 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L34WJQ"&gt;The June 5th letter to Twitter said the company had not yet met the requirements for the new roles, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported, and could results in India holding Twitter legally liable for content on its platform. But the letter stated that “as gesture of goodwill, Twitter Inc is hereby given one last notice to immediately comply with the Rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="993BRH"&gt;Twitter has tangled with the Indian government on several fronts in recent months. In April, the social platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;removed tweets critical&lt;/a&gt; of the Indian government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and did so at the government's request. And late last month, police in the Indian cities of Delhi and Guragon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;raided Twitter offices&lt;/a&gt; there as part of an investigation into why some tweets by government officials were labeled as “manipulated media” under Twitter’s policy. There were no employees in the offices at the time, as Twitter employees in India were working remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noQ7Gq"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLVkyX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers reportedly used a compromised password in Colonial Pipeline cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Colonial Pipeline Storage Tanks" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06nE8mij9ZQwphFkgNfqJ3trOes=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410925/1232834767.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dckft0"&gt;An analysis of the cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline found that the hackers were able to access the company’s network using a compromised VPN password, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The hack led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443933/colonial-pipeline-ransom-4-million-hack-gas-shortage"&gt;ransomware payout of $4.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, and resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gas-prices-hit-3-a-gallon-as-shortage-sets-in-amid-colonial-pipeline-shutdown-11620832180"&gt;gas prices around $3 per gallon&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in several years at US gas stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTOhAS"&gt;According to cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the VPN account didn’t use multi-factor authentication, which allowed the hackers to access Colonial’s network with a compromised username and password. It’s not clear whether the hackers discovered the username or were able to figure it out independently. The password was discovered among a batch of passwords leaked on the dark web, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7TtaW"&gt;The breach occurred April 29th, according to Mandiant, and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;discovered on May 7th&lt;/a&gt; by a control room employee who saw the ransomware note. That prompted the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;take the pipeline offline&lt;/a&gt; to contain the potential threat. Close to half of the fuel in the eastern US travels through the affected pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4dajG"&gt;In response to the hack, the Transportation Security Administration put a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/27/1000694357/in-wake-of-colonial-attack-pipelines-now-must-report-cybersecurity-breaches"&gt;new policy into place&lt;/a&gt; requiring pipeline operators to report cyberattacks to the government within 12 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anCoec"&gt;Colonial Pipeline CEO Joseph Blount is &lt;a href="https://homeland.house.gov/activities/hearings/cyber-threats-in-the-pipeline-using-lessons-from-the-colonial-ransomware-attack-to-defend-critical-infrastructure"&gt;scheduled to appear&lt;/a&gt; before the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 9th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise gets permit from California to provide passenger test rides in driverless vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Test Drive Robot Car Cruise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v1FdN-BIvRtiI3Oqr9S3X469olw=/32x0:2528x1664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410778/1189070708.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NwdI3B"&gt;The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) &lt;a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) it has authorized General Motors-owned self-driving vehicle company Cruise to provide driverless passenger service to the public in its robotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNdgvL"&gt;The CPUC said Cruise is the first entrant in its driverless pilot program, which lets companies give test rides in vehicles without drivers. Under the terms of the program, Cruise may not charge passengers for the rides, and the company must submit quarterly reports to the CPUC about the vehicles’ operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk04DI"&gt;Cruise has been testing its driverless vehicles in San Francisco, and last month &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-waymo-cruise-seek-permits-charge-self-driving-car-rides-san-francisco-2021-05-11/"&gt;applied for a permit&lt;/a&gt; that will allow the company to charge for autonomous rides and deliveries in the area. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;unveiled its Cruise Origin&lt;/a&gt;, a  prototype vehicle without a steering wheel, pedals, or any controls typically associated with human driving last year. It’s slated to begin production at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt; starting in &lt;a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2021/05/13/cruise-plans-start-making-autonomous-origin-shuttle-2023/5078848001/"&gt;early 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, most of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/gms-cruise-begins-testing-autonomous-vehicles-without-human-drivers-in-san-francisco.html"&gt;Cruise’s driverless test vehicles&lt;/a&gt; are Chevrolet Bolt EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaEe5Z"&gt;In addition to Cruise, &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/avcissued/"&gt;seven other companies&lt;/a&gt;, which include Google spinoff Waymo, Zoox, owned by Amazon, and Aurora, have CPUC permits to test driverless vehicles on roads in California, but only Cruise is permitted to provide rides to passengers without a driver on board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMqyN8"&gt;In California, companies need permits from both the CPUC and the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to test driverless vehicles (and eventually, to get the vehicles on the road with passengers). A total of &lt;a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"&gt;55 companies have active permits&lt;/a&gt; from the DMV to test driverless vehicles in California, including Cruise, but so far Nuro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197980/nuro-licensed-autonomous-deliveries-california"&gt;is the only company&lt;/a&gt; to receive a deployment permit from the DMV that allows it to operate its autonomous vehicles in California commercially. That deployment permit doesn’t allow Nuro to transport passengers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfEDar"&gt;In January, Microsoft announced a long-term strategic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238407/microsoft-cruise-self-driving-investment-azure-cloud"&gt;partnership with Cruise&lt;/a&gt;, and said it was joining a $2 billion funding round that pushed Cruise’s valuation to $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI is trying to get IP addresses and phone numbers of people who read a USA Today article</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LnGltTEjwvFv3g0I5JXRG7ieV08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410733/acastro_200218_3900_StoryStream_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvLENO"&gt;The FBI is trying to get a list of IP addresses, phone numbers, and other information on people who read a &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; article about the deaths of two of its agents (&lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/03/usa-today-subpeona-florida-shooting-491847"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.1.pdf"&gt;The subpoena&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) says it relates to a criminal investigation, and is seeking the information of readers who accessed the article in a specific 35-minute timespan, but it’s unclear who or what the Bureau is trying to track down. &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; is fighting back against handing over the information, calling the request unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE4VfF"&gt;“We were surprised to receive this subpoena particularly in light of President Biden’s recent statements in support of press freedom.  The subpoena is also contrary to the Justice Department’s own guidelines concerning the narrow circumstances in which subpoenas can be issued to the news media,” &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; publisher Maribel Perez Wadsworth said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="plNW1z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/02/sunrise-florida-shooting-fbi-agents-injured/4352344001/"&gt;The article in question&lt;/a&gt; was one published on February 2nd, 2021, about a shootout that occurred when FBI agents &lt;a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/02/04/source-fbi-shooting-suspect-david-huber-sunrise/"&gt;tried to execute a search warrant&lt;/a&gt; in a child pornography case, resulting in the deaths of two FBI agents and the suspect. The subpoena, filled by an FBI special agent, requests a large amount of information about the devices that accessed the article from 7:03PM ET to 7:38PM ET on the evening it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t-LuODuCYiS_6InAhGehAV40GT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638577/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_4.09.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CourtListener&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of the subpoena, which the FBI sent to a closed office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bFXkXX"&gt;It’s unclear why the request was made, given that the suspect described in the article was, by the time the article was published, reported to be dead. Whatever the FBI is looking for, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; says &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951/gov.uscourts.dcd.231951.1.0.pdf"&gt;in its court filing&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that the request violates the First Amendment, citing multiple rulings from previous cases where the government was not allowed access to similar records. It also argues that the FBI accessing the general records of who read a story could put a cooling effect on its journalistic efforts — as a Supreme Court Justice cited in the motion put it in 1953, the government asking for this kind of information can make people feel like someone is reading over their shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUCoNE"&gt;Perez Wadsworth said in the statement that &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;’s attorneys attempted to contact the FBI before moving forward to fight the subpoena in court. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Despite these attempts, we never received any substantive reply nor any meaningful explanation of the asserted basis for the subpoena,” she said. “We intend to fight the subpoena’s demand for identifying information about individuals who viewed the USA TODAY news report. Being forced to tell the government who reads what on our websites is a clear violation of the First Amendment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiCLaT"&gt;She added that USA Today has asked the court to quash the subpoena “to protect the important relationship and trust between USA TODAY’s readers and our journalists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZXklV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtqAIC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memorials to honor COVID-19 dead begin to take shape</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The National Covid Memorial Wall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPurKEdqDAgxtXUkwi5KvCp-g_I=/0x0:4724x3149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410634/1233138114.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PAM853"&gt;How can we possibly memorialize the brutal toll of COVID-19? It’s something I’ve been thinking about this week. The US observed Memorial Day on May 31, honoring people who died in military service. Artists, politicians, and activists are now starting to think about how to memorialize the more than 3.7 million people around the world who have died of COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whaazx"&gt;Temporary memorials have already sprung up over the past 18 months, &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/11/coronavirus-deaths-covid-memorials-remembering-victims.html"&gt;with flags, painted hearts, and pictures honoring the dead&lt;/a&gt;. But plans for new, more permanent memorials are starting to take shape. Some are massive structures, others are quiet gardens, and still others will be incorporated into spaces already dedicated to memorializing people who have died. In the UK, plans are being discussed for a &lt;a href="https://guernseypress.com/news/uk-news/2021/05/12/boris-johnson-sets-out-plans-for-coronavirus-memorials/"&gt;memorial in London&lt;/a&gt; at St. Paul’s Cathedral. Last August, a team in Uruguay announced plans to build a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/08/940802688/hardly-any-1918-flu-memorials-exist-will-we-remember-covid-19-differently"&gt;large-scale memorial to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in Montevideo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A concave concrete bowl with a hole in the middle is built out over the coast." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIuhCvCT-XlZ7_T6JuyVqhbScWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22639357/01_MMP_IMAGEN.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GomezPlatero&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An artist’s impression of what the memorial in Montevideo might look like. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r8BJlp"&gt;Whatever form those memorials end up taking, they’ll occupy a unique place in the memorial landscape. Compared to other tributes, disease memorials are relatively rare. There are almost no memorials to the millions who died during the 1918 flu pandemic, and the few that do exist &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/1918-flu-memorials.html"&gt;were only installed recently&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjTg2a"&gt;Unlike diseases, wars, attacks, and disasters are usually finite, tied to a particular place, or a defined time. Memorials to those kinds of events can be set up at specific places. Diseases, on the other hand, can be more pervasive, spreading throughout whole regions or populations. There’s no equivalent to Ground Zero for COVID-19, just like there wasn’t for the flu that ravaged the world in 1918. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giau92"&gt;Many diseases are &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/sociology-disease-disgust-shame"&gt;also stigmatized&lt;/a&gt;, making them &lt;a href="https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20200617/lessons-from-hiv-ebola-can-help-mitigate-covid19-stigma"&gt;harder for people to talk about&lt;/a&gt;. In the past few decades, public memorials have helped break through that stigma. Forty years ago today, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5021a1.htm#:~:text=Twenty%20years%20ago%2C%20on%20June,homosexuals%22%3B%20two%20had%20died."&gt;first reports&lt;/a&gt; of a different epidemic — HIV/AIDS — were published by the CDC. The disease tore through the gay community, and homophobia and fear left patients and their loved ones ostracized. &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/artery/2015/05/01/aids-memorials"&gt;The AIDS quilt&lt;/a&gt;, first displayed in 1987, showed the world the devastation of the epidemic, and helped pressure officials to do something about the disease, instead of ignoring the growing death toll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaCpAT"&gt;COVID-19 memorials are being built in a different environment than the ones built by AIDS activists in the 1980s. Research into COVID-19 is well-funded, and the societal pressures between the two are nothing alike. What they do have in common is a need for a space to mourn.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VhbZKw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;establishing memorials can be a part of helping societies heal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3ajuW"&gt;Other deadly outbreaks have shown that establishing memorials can be a part of helping societies heal after devastating and disruptive loss. As a part of efforts to combat Ebola, experts &lt;a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/51580/1007-3384-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;recommended that memorials&lt;/a&gt; be established in affected regions, to give communities a safe space to mourn their dead. Cemeteries and memorials for people who died of Ebola were &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30626732"&gt;established in Liberia&lt;/a&gt; and other countries. Similar plans could help comfort people grieving loved ones lost to COVID-19, who may have had to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-57362876"&gt;forgo funeral rituals&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oW70hZ"&gt;Some COVID-19 memorials are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/jersey-city-announces-plan-for-covid-19-memorial-park-at-former-superfund-site/2760964/"&gt;already taking shape&lt;/a&gt;, from gardens and parks to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/arts/design/coronavirus-memorials-italy-britain.html"&gt;steel statues&lt;/a&gt;. Others may take longer to come together. Advisory committees are being set up to plan for memorials across the US, from &lt;a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2021/03/24/long-beach-mayor-announces-forthcoming-covid-19-memorial-project-to-honor-those-who-have-died/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/546783-new-york-plans-to-build-memorial-to-covid-19-essential-workers"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/12/11/22170479/hart-island-covid-memorial-new-york-city-potters-field"&gt;Ideas for a COVID-19 memorial&lt;/a&gt; in New York City at the city’s public burial grounds are still in their infancy (The city’s sanitation department — hard-hit by the pandemic — recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/nyregion/nyc-virus-memorials.html"&gt;unveiled its own memorial&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBsGiE"&gt;All these monuments, made of steel and stone, and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-57133573"&gt;living wood&lt;/a&gt; will be designed to honor people who are gone, or who contributed to the efforts to stop the pandemic. There will be plaques and parks, statues and stained glass, all trying to comprehend something that is incomprehensible. Any effort will be complicated by the sheer immensity of the task at hand. The number of dead that need to be memorialized continues to grow, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22424422/pandemic-covid-coronavirus-death-toll-estimate-antivirus"&gt;may never be known fully&lt;/a&gt;. Anything we come up with will only be an echo of the vast loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDikyW"&gt;“Even if we could come up with a complete census of COVID’s victims,” author and journalist Justin Davidson &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2021/03/covid-memorial-project-design-pandemic.html"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Curbed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year, “inscribing all their names would require a wall the size of Hoover Dam” &lt;/p&gt;

Hospitalizations among kids aged 12-17 went up earlier this year, and the CDC is urging people in this age group to get the vaccine.  (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter blocked in Nigeria after deleting a tweet by its president </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZp21XpU6txa9U-OX0bUhUeWYeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410594/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wq5AdK"&gt;Twitter is suspended “indefinitely” in Nigeria, “for the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence,” according to a statement (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;threaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) from the country’s minister of information and culture. The move comes days after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003506918/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-it-deleted-a-tweet-by-the-president"&gt;removed a threatening tweet&lt;/a&gt; by president Muhammadu Buhari which Twitter said violated its “abusive behavior” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67sf2I"&gt;The statement from Minister Lai Mohammed did not mention the deleted tweet, or what form the suspension would take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYudQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;— Fed Min of Info &amp;amp; Cu (@FMICNigeria) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843065364029446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MQTzgj"&gt;In Buhari’s deleted tweet, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-presidents-tweet-was-deleted"&gt;he suggested he would punish&lt;/a&gt; secessionists. “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Biafra war,” he wrote. “Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” Buhari was a major general during the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51094093"&gt;Biafra war&lt;/a&gt;, which left more than a million people dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emAxut"&gt;Twitter’s Public Policy team said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?s=20"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Saturday it was “deeply concerned” and would work to restore access in Nigeria. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nigeria-indefinitely-suspends-twitter-operations-information-minister-2021-06-04"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that Twitter’s website was not accessible on some of Nigeria’s mobile carriers, but appeared to be working sporadically on other carriers in Lagos and Abuja, two of the country’s biggest cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ICrSyl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenInternet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OpenInternet&lt;/a&gt; is an essential human right in modern society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeepitOn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KeepitOn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psgpRx"&gt;“Suspending Twitter in Nigeria is just one more way of stating that people’s rights do not matter just what the State wants,” Osai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International in Nigeria &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/livingtruely/status/1400887522398543881?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a dangerous precedent and must be called out for what it is.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmnestyNigeria/status/1400862127456391168?s=20"&gt;Amnesty called on Nigerian authorities&lt;/a&gt; to immediately reverse the suspension, “and other plans to gag the media, repress civic space, and undermine Nigerians’ human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5GW2"&gt;In April, Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/establishing-twitter-s-presence-in-africa.html"&gt;opened its first office in Africa&lt;/a&gt; in Ghana, which some in Nigeria considered a snub. In its announcement, Twitter cited Ghana’s support of free speech, online freedom and the Open Internet as the reasons for its decision. Nigeria’s information minister &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/media-portrayal-nigeria-led-twitter-choose-ghana-africa-office-minister-2021-04-16/"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter’s decision not to locate its Africa offices in Nigeria was due to misrepresentation of the country by the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2r6v8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/africa/nigeria/report-nigeria/"&gt;According to a 2020 report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, Nigerian authorities “used repressive laws to harass, intimidate, arrest and detain human rights defenders, activists, media workers and perceived critics. Non-state actors also subjected journalists to intimidation, harassment and beatings.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Supreme Court pared down a controversial anti-hacking law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Supreme Court Releases Opinions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6JRemP_2WR-Evf0-bousC1LiQu4=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410461/1319807308.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="76uI31"&gt;The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a controversial anti-hacking law which bans “exceeding authorized access” on a computer system, was narrowed by the Supreme Court on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf"&gt;in a 6-3 ruling&lt;/a&gt;. The court said the law shouldn’t cover people misusing systems they’re allowed to access — and that claiming otherwise would criminalize a “breathtaking amount” of everyday computer use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08PEaS"&gt;The court case, &lt;em&gt;Van Buren v. United States&lt;/em&gt;, concerns a former Georgia police officer named Nathan Van Buren. Van Buren accepted $5,000 in exchange for looking up a woman’s license plate in a police database. (The deal was actually an FBI sting operation, and the plate number was fictitious.) Because the exchange violated department rules, prosecutors said Van Buren had “exceeded access” to the system. Van Buren’s lawyers argued that whether or not he misused the database, he was authorized to access it — and therefore hadn’t violated anti-hacking laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ERxoqW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cases should be judged on gate-crashing systems, not misusing data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="65fQiI"&gt;The Supreme Court’s majority opinion, delivered by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, concurred. It backed a “gates-up-or-down” approach to authorization: accessing parts of a system that are specifically forbidden breaks CFAA rules, but simply accessing authorized areas in an unapproved way does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCb4Ln"&gt;Barrett’s opinion noted that people routinely bend or break the rules of computers and web services. “The government’s interpretation of the ‘exceeds authorized access’ clause would attach criminal penalties to a breathtaking amount of commonplace computer activity,” she wrote. “If the ‘exceeds authorized access’ clause criminalizes every violation of a computer-use policy, then millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens are criminals.” The law could cover an employee who sends a personal email on a work computer, for example, or “criminalize everything from embellishing an online dating profile to using a pseudonym on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6XT2nm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It could “criminalize everything from embellishing an online dating profile to using a pseudonym on Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BDRPs1"&gt;Legal experts and civil liberties advocates broadly praised the overall ruling. “This is an important victory for civil liberties and civil rights enforcement in the digital age,” said Esha Bhandari, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project deputy director. Electronic Frontier Foundation staff members Aaron Mackey and Kurt Opsahl also &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security"&gt;called the decision&lt;/a&gt; a victory, saying the court “provided good language that should help protect researchers, investigative journalists, and others.” (Both organizations previously filed briefs supporting Van Buren.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTwcuR"&gt;CFAA can be used to crack down on legitimately malicious hacking, but it’s also notoriously vague, and different charges can carry penalties of up to 5, 10, or 20 years in prison. Critics argue that this combination threatens researchers and other people who use freely accessible information in unapproved ways. Federal prosecutors can stack up intimidating charges against targets, as was the case with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/01/aaron-swartz-cfaa-a-year-after-aaron-swartz-s-death-the-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act-remains-unchanged.html"&gt;activist Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide in 2013 while facing prosecution. Companies can also use it to &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/how-strange-secretive-cult-company-waging-legal-war-against-journalists/"&gt;harass journalists&lt;/a&gt; or employees that leak documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E3yy6A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CFAA’s definition of hacking was notoriously broad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E75c0Y"&gt;In theory, prosecutors now have to establish that users actually accessed parts of a system they were barred from entering. “I think it’s a really substantial deal,” Cornell University Law School professor James Grimmelmann tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It really clarifies that employees using computers disloyally is not a CFAA issue, and that blows away an enormous piece of criminal and civil use of the CFAA.” The ruling could also affect &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859399/linkedin-hiq-data-scraping-cfaa-lawsuit-ninth-circuit-ruling"&gt;cases involving scraping&lt;/a&gt;, or mass-collecting publicly available data from websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnBRtA"&gt;Employees may still be guilty of other offenses, like stealing trade secrets, says Grimmelmann, and data scrapers could face CFAA charges if their activities cause a site to become inaccessible. But &lt;em&gt;Van Buren&lt;/em&gt; raises the bar for what’s considered criminal hacking. “You get rid of a huge swathe of things that are not really high-tech, dangerous hacker crimes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nbsJHL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What is a gate? It’s an open question&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOzAZB"&gt;The ruling also leaves crucial questions unanswered, though. The court’s decision didn’t ultimately rest on the law’s overall impact or validity. It focused on a dictionary definition of one word (“so”) to decide if “exceeding authorized access” should be defined like a similar ban on computer use “without authorization” — which uses the gate metaphor. And while it says violators must have bypassed some metaphorical “gate,” it doesn’t firmly define these gates. On Twitter, Berkeley Law professor and CFAA expert Orin Kerr &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1400461828807741455"&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; a footnote that implies gates could be technical barriers &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; rules in a contract — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1400462972372193290"&gt;in Kerr’s words&lt;/a&gt;, something as potentially broad as “do not access this computer for a bad purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sW7zhu"&gt;“It is still an open question whether the restriction on access has to be technological or contractual,” says former EFF staff member and computer crime attorney Hanni Fakhoury. As Fakhoury notes, the ruling does say it’s not necessarily “plausible” for the CFAA to hinge on fine semantic distinctions in private contracts. “It certainly seems to me they’re uneasy about the idea that the CFAA would somehow become a tool to criminalize contractual obligations,” he concludes. But it leaves this big question for lower courts to debate — at least until another case reaches the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where did the microchip vaccine conspiracy theory come from anyway?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of five hands, each scrolling through images of syringes twisted out of shape on mobile phones." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDW97V6v07Zn3UdLj6vs6ZkuX5w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410101/VRG_ILLO_4617_Microchip_Vaccine_Conspiracy_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Tyler Comrie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How an innocuous Reddit thread mutated into a dangerous, viral lie&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="w5899D"&gt;On October 2nd, 2020, then-President Donald Trump and the first lady tested positive for the coronavirus. As we were all waking up to the news, I got into my car and tuned in to &lt;em&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt; on Power 105.1 FM in New York, where Charlamagne Tha God, its most outspoken host, wasn’t having it. “I got a few thoughts and one of those thoughts is the reason I’m saying ‘allegedly,’” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOEzKa"&gt;At the time, the country was accelerating into the third wave of the pandemic, and the president had been appearing at large, mask-less rallies. But the news didn’t sit right with Charlamagne. “The conspiracy theorist in me simply doesn’t believe it,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gpasP"&gt;As I listened, he seemed to build a conspiracy theory on the fly. According to Charlamagne, the president was pretending to get the coronavirus so he could be the first to take the vaccine and become a hero to the world just in time for the election. Which is the provocative, Sasquatch-exists brand of conspiracy theory you might expect to hear on the show. But then Charlamagne took the conversation in a direction I didn’t see coming: “Millions will line up to take the vaccine, and boom, microchips for all of y’all,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;right in time for goddamn Thanksgiving.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F7AU6p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be clear: there are no microchips in any vaccine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hOmGz4"&gt;Microchips? In the vaccine? I looked around to see if I could make eye contact with any neighbors. &lt;em&gt;Did anyone else hear that?&lt;/em&gt; I thought. But no one else was shaking their head at their radio. Hopefully, the millions who tune in to this nationally syndicated show knew he was just joking. Right? But after the fourth time Charlamagne repeated his wild claim that the government is putting microchips in the COVID-19 vaccine, I couldn’t help but wonder: is this going to be a problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ixsWoA"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PQa3VP"&gt;To be clear: there are no microchips in any vaccine. There’s no evidence that even one of the nearly 170 million Americans who have received a shot so far have been implanted with a tiny piece of tracking hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUqvjt"&gt;But this conspiracy, along with other false claims about the vaccine, has gained traction. These dangerous myths have built on a distrust of vaccines sown for years by well-organized groups that launched targeted, effective disinformation campaigns. Through &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brooklyn-measles-outbreak-how-glossy-booklet-spread-anti-vaccine-messages-n993596"&gt;glossy magazines&lt;/a&gt; distributed to Orthodox Jews in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-became-anti-vaxxer-icon-nightmare"&gt;intimate seminars&lt;/a&gt; led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the California coast, and deceptive websites like the National Vaccine Information Center, these messages found receptive audiences among Americans who have grown more distrustful of its elites and institutions.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrNrF2"&gt;Even before COVID-19, anti-vaccine disinformation has had &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-019-0354-3"&gt;real consequences&lt;/a&gt; for our health. Measles, which was controlled in the 20th century, is back in the 21st. One of the key reasons, according to Seth Berkley, CEO of the nonprofit Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance: “the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine.” The World Health Organization now ranks vaccine hesitancy as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019"&gt;top 10 threats&lt;/a&gt; to global health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z1NSjI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I would just look at them like, ‘This is not the time to play’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf1plk"&gt;In the US, polling from March found that 42 percent of respondents believed at least one COVID-19 conspiracy theory. That &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f7671d12c27e40b67ce4400/t/60a3d7b3301db14adb211911/1621350327260/FINAL+for+posting_Facebook+Survey+Summary+Document+for+Website.docx.pdf"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, commissioned by the nonprofit Surgo Ventures, found that 16 percent of eligible Americans are a hardened group of COVID-19 skeptics steeped in conspiracy theories, while another 7 percent are system distrusters. The skeptics are disproportionately white and conservative, while the system distrusters are heavily Black and Latinx. This mixture of ideological strains means vaccine hesitancy has taken hold in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-california-farmworkers/?no_nav=true&amp;amp;tid=a_classic-iphone"&gt;rural communities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brooklyn-measles-outbreak-how-glossy-booklet-spread-anti-vaccine-messages-n993596"&gt;religious enclaves&lt;/a&gt;, in dense coastal cities and in &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/05/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-became-anti-vaxxer-icon-nightmare"&gt;wine country&lt;/a&gt;. As the nation moves into a phase when most vaccine enthusiasts have gotten their shots, this broad coalition of the skeptical poses a massive challenge for public health officials. The next phase of vaccination will likely depend on reaching members of this population and understanding their specific concerns.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3sJQy"&gt;Jordan Dow works at Kings County, a large public hospital in Brooklyn, about a mile from where I heard the microchip rumor. He said he was hearing a variant on the microchip conspiracy in his ER. Dow said that of the hundreds of patients he was giving COVID-19 nasal tests to every day, 1 in 5 would ask about a tracking microchip on the end of the swab. “I would just look at them like, ‘This is not the time to play,’” he told me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE07I1"&gt;Most would laugh and go on with the test; others would refuse. The Surgo survey found that 1 in 14 people believe a tracking chip might be planted with the vaccine. A &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-03/topline-axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index-w42.pdf"&gt;poll from &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; / Ipsos&lt;/a&gt;, also from March, asked 1,000 American adults if the COVID-19 vaccines contained a tracking microchip. More than 1 in 4 said they didn’t know. That’s the equivalent of nearly 69 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A looping animated illustration of a hand scrolling through images of syringes twisted out of shape on a mobile phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4jmfYmGbF6mteSOzWYY9Lk8VvI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638065/VRG_4617_Microchip_Vaccine_Conspiracy_002.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9LXM2f"&gt;Joan Donovan, research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, is the kind of disinformation researcher who listens to white supremacist podcasts at 2AM. That’s actually how she first learned about a mysterious illness in China before she had seen news of the outbreak published anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSCT5B"&gt;“I don’t think anybody’s written a definitive case on the microchips,” she said, “but I have one kind of half-done that might be useful for you.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLrHZ1"&gt;Donovan’s analysis led me to some web chatter at the dawn of the US pandemic, on March 18th, 2020 — after the NBA had suspended its season but when reported American deaths were still around 150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVo222"&gt;That’s when Bill Gates, whose foundation has pledged $1.75 billion toward international pandemic aid, logged onto a Reddit AMA to answer questions about the pandemic. In &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/?context=3"&gt;the chat&lt;/a&gt;, he predicted that one day, we would all carry a digital passport for our health records. He suggested not a microchip, but some kind of e-vaccine card that people could flash before going into a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7UmdV"&gt;The next day, a Swedish website that reads like a tabloid full of memes about biohacking wrote about Gates’ comment. The site’s administrator, who goes by the name CyphR, belongs to a community of biohackers who advocate for human implantable microchips. They also have them — and hope that one day we all will be using them to monitor our biometrics and verify our identity. But they believed that future was a decade away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hTeiG3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We advocate for the adoption of biohacking wherever possible, even if it means memeing the desired outcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8tB4sH"&gt;That is until they saw Gates’ comment about digital certificates on Reddit. “We’re like, WTF! This is it! Suddenly, chip implants don’t only have an actual, scalable mainstream application, but one that is an urgent medical need,” CyphR said in an email. The bloggers connected Gates’ remark with various research projects supported by the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, including one &lt;a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/523/eaay7162"&gt;December 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; exploring invisible “quantum dot” tattoos that could reveal your vaccine history when held close to a special smartphone light. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPNbOa"&gt;Then, CyphR acknowledged, they made a fateful “jump” — by suggesting the best way to implement Gates’ idea was through an implantable microchip. “We did what [we] do best and tried to meme this biohack into the mainstream,” CyphR wrote. “As advocates of biohacking, that’s what we do. We advocate for the adoption of biohacking wherever possible, even if it means memeing the desired outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXTwHh"&gt;Their headline read: “Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnduMz"&gt;Two days later, Adam Fannin, a polemical Baptist pastor from Jacksonville, Florida, stumbled upon the blog post online. It resonated with his deep distrust of Gates and he ran with it. Fannin, who started his own church with its own YouTube channel in 2017, transformed the biohackers’ fantasy into a biblical prophecy, one that was warned about in the book of Revelation: “It’s not just an implantable ID system,” Fannin says on a YouTube video. “It’s literally worshipping this beast.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAicO8"&gt;The pastor’s nine-minute sermon tapped into a long-standing, wide-ranging conspiracy theory that Gates, through his business and philanthropy, is trying to “depopulate” the planet. The pastor titled the post, “Bill Gates – Microchip Vaccine Implants to fight Coronavirus,” adding one pivotal word to the biohackers’ title: vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7GHRRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each time I saw a new host repeat the lie, it seemed to mutate, tapping into a new strain of American mistrust&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7VTbOm"&gt;The video quickly got 1.6 million views — an order of magnitude more than the pastor’s account had ever received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22HWzi"&gt;Then the conspiracy theory spread. Posts like this were suddenly getting shared by shock-jock comedians and doomsday preppers on YouTube; by the far-right news site Newsmax; by pop culture icons such as M.I.A. and Kanye West; and by defiant, conspiracy-minded members of Gen Z on TikTok. In one minute-long video, a young woman points at spurious microchip-related screenshots and over an &lt;em&gt;X-Files-&lt;/em&gt;style score says, “It’s already being activated across the globe, including New York.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azaAFZ"&gt;Each time I saw a new host repeat the lie, it seemed to mutate, tapping into a new strain of American mistrust: mistrust of the medical system, mistrust of the government, mistrust of powerful elites. And then there’s Roger Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zq6SFA"&gt;On April 13th, 2020, in Stone, the lie found the superspreader it had been waiting for. That’s when the former political adviser to Trump, who was convicted of repeatedly lying to Congress, made a guest appearance on &lt;em&gt;The Joe Piscopo Show&lt;/em&gt; on AM 970 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zArN0K"&gt;The early &lt;em&gt;SNL&lt;/em&gt; star didn’t even need to prompt Stone before he launched in. “Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate,” Stone said. “He and other globalists are definitely using it in a drive for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXRv14"&gt;Later that afternoon, the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; gave the story legitimacy, running the headline, “Roger Stone: Bill Gates may have created coronavirus to microchip people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7VqBy"&gt;Soon, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; story and the pastor’s video each had over a million interactions on Facebook. Since then, the lie has continued spreading and mutating across the world. By January, according to the Surgo survey, 1 in 10 US adults — and 1 in 7 Republicans — said they believed a tracking chip would be implanted with the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvj4Ym"&gt;Charlamagne and the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; did not respond to queries about their role in spreading the conspiracy, and Reddit spokesperson Sierra Gamelgaard&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;claimed the conspiracy had existed in the bowels of the web — on 4plebs — before it surfaced on Reddit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEHIVP"&gt;But Fannin and Stone defended their remarks. “The idea of a microchip in order to track who has been vaccinated is no crazier than the idea of a vaccine passport,” Stone said. “The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives every American the right to question the safety of any vaccination.” Fannin, the YouTube preacher, confirmed his view that “Bill Gates is an evil person” — and that he has continued to avoid the vaccine himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReyMRu"&gt;It’s easy to write off these beliefs as far-fetched. But since I started looking closely at this conspiracy theory, I started seeing microchips everywhere. One night, I turned on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; and saw a segment about how the US military is developing a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/last-pandemic-science-military-60-minutes-2021-04-11/"&gt;subdermal implantable sensor&lt;/a&gt; to detect viruses. But it’s not a tracking microchip, right? Then a couple weeks later, the show was reporting on an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/semiconductor-chip-shortage-60-minutes-2021-05-02/"&gt;international microchip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. Where’d they all go? Then IBM announced that the company had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/06/tech/ibm-semiconductor-two-nanometer/index.html"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; the smallest, most powerful microchip ever. It felt like I was consuming the raw material that would shape the next microchip conspiracy theory.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An illustration of four syringes in a grid. Each are twisted out of shape in a different way and atop of a unique background color." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SjzInnKlZGWzwXXE0e_YREXFMb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638042/VRG_4617_Microchip_Vaccine_Conspiracy_003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OCYiUH"&gt;Social media is the place where so much information gets repackaged and shared as misinformation. So I went to the major platforms to ask what they are doing to contain this high-stakes infodemic. Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said that by May, the platform had removed 16 million pieces of content for violating its COVID-19 and vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641/"&gt;misinformation policy&lt;/a&gt; and slapped warning labels on 167 million pieces of content rated false by its fact-checking partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNDjaD"&gt;YouTube offered a statement saying the platform had removed 900,000 misleading videos about the coronavirus, including 30,000 just about the vaccines. The video platform even has an &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785?hl=en"&gt;explicit policy&lt;/a&gt; banning videos that claim there are microchips in the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLOcNU"&gt;TikTok pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/covid-19/"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; that prohibits medical misinformation, including vaccine misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNN8Jo"&gt;But according to &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, based in London and Washington, platforms fail to act on 95 percent of COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation reported to them. That means that when people go looking for accurate information about the vaccine, there’s a decent chance they will run into a falsehood first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1kxq0"&gt;In April, the video by the Baptist pastor that helped spark this conspiracy was still up, with nearly 2 million views. I asked YouTube why, but officials declined to answer. Instead, two days later — more than a year after the pastor shared it, spawning a wave of social media disinformation — YouTube decided to take the video down for violating its medical misinformation guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afFn65"&gt;In total, the platform removed six out of seven YouTube videos I asked about. The comedian Andrew Schulz — who said, “So if you think that there’s not going to be more shit in that chip that they’re going to put in our arm besides proof that we’ve been vaccinated, you’re outta your goddamn mind” — got to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUEhDc"&gt;TikTok likewise removed five of the six videos I asked about and quarantined the other one to limit its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6xVsh"&gt;Given the scale of this problem and the severity of the public health risks it poses, I figured there’d be a war room of epidemiologists and disinformation specialists somewhere in the federal government poring over posts, monitoring conspiracies, and coordinating with social media platforms and media outlets to halt their spread. Instead, Facebook, for instance, said the platform uses machine learning and human fact-checkers to moderate posts to flag misinformation after it lives on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KXzhF0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“less than one-half of 1 percent of global funding has gone to any research or any programs addressing misinformation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P1dmoe"&gt;In January, a year after the first US case was reported, the White House released a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/National-Strategy-for-the-COVID-19-Response-and-Pandemic-Preparedness.pdf"&gt;national COVID-19 response plan&lt;/a&gt; that included building the “capacity to quickly identify disinformation.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But when I repeatedly asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention what resources it has deployed for tracking and responding to that misinformation, I couldn’t get an answer. I spoke with a member of the White House’s COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, Bobby Watts, who is also CEO of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council. He told me about the federal government’s strategy to tackle vaccine hesitancy “with a mass education campaign to let people know about the importance of vaccinations,” including messages tailored to various Asian American and Pacific Islander cultures, Spanish speakers, people experiencing homelessness, and rural Republicans. But he didn’t know whether the federal government has a way of monitoring and interrupting misinformation influencing those communities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lR9x9w"&gt;After weeks of asking the CDC and the White House to provide details on how they are monitoring COVID-19 misinformation, I finally turned to Joe Smyser, a public health expert whose nonprofit helped create the nation’s largest vaccine misinformation tracking system. &lt;a href="https://projectvctr.com/"&gt;Project VCTR&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “vector”) is now used by 450 organizations, including the health department for New York City, the city whose radio and print outlets were so decisive in the early spread of the microchip conspiracy theory. Smyser said he has been talking with a team of data scientists at the CDC who just last year started to build their own misinformation monitoring system. But he said they had to proceed with caution — and were constrained from communicating with state health departments — because misinformation was so politicized in the last administration. The CDC did not respond to queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpiCBA"&gt;Tracking medical misinformation is a relatively new and underfunded field of public health. Of the flood of money dedicated to coronavirus vaccine research, production, and distribution since the pandemic began, Smyser said, “less than one-half of 1 percent of global funding has gone to any research or any programs addressing misinformation.” The nonprofit CDC Foundation, he pointed out, recently put out a &lt;a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/social-media-vaccine-misinformation-call-slides?inline"&gt;request for proposals&lt;/a&gt; for combating misinformation through social media; three to four projects will receive around $2 million each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzJecX"&gt;Meanwhile, the disinvestment has left county and state health departments mostly on their own, fighting the tide of COVID-19 misinformation while trying to get enough vaccines in enough arms to finally bring an end to the pandemic. With the nation’s current anemic response to misinformation, a new projection from the Surgo survey estimates that only 58 percent of the US population, including 74 percent of adults, will be vaccinated by next April.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JI8bRP"&gt;In New York, where the microchip theory first went mainstream, the city has a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/nyregion/vaccine-hesitancy-outreach.html"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; that tracks vaccine rumors in order to inform its educational messaging. I recently found my way to the State Department of Health webpage dedicated to combating vaccine misinformation. It was last updated in January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says Bing’s ‘Tank Man’ censorship was a human error</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZvjmR656ik9VAzw9-3xX_FykS0=/2x0:329x218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69409375/Tianasquare.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5bDTkb"&gt;On Microsoft’s search engine Bing, searching for “Tank Man,” the iconic figure from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, turned up no image results in the United States for part of Friday. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8v9m/bing-censors-tank-man"&gt;Vice was able to produce the same results&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and heard from multiple users from other countries who ran into the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLTXln"&gt;Stranger still, searching “Tank Man” or “Tiananmen Square Tank Man” turned up normal search results in Bing, it’s just images that were mysteriously missing. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Microsoft for an explanation, it said “&lt;em&gt;This is due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KV2qfVdLPMUtGauWzxdci8QTuWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638218/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_12.54.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search results for “Tank Man” after the accident.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoL7SF"&gt;It’s an unfortunately timed accident given that June 4th, 2021 is the 32nd anniversary of the student-led protests in China — an uprising in response to changes in the country that was met with assault rifles, tanks, and a massacre. Microsoft did eventually restore results to the specific search, though it’s still noticeably missing the well-known image. Adding in a mention of “Tiananmen” or “Tiananmen Square” pulls up what you’d expect, however. It’s not clear why Bing would weigh generic images of tanks more heavily than a famous piece of visual history, but we’ve reached out to Microsoft see if that’s normal. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCFXMtJY_t9JzVIZhi6KwJP8Bp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638266/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_1.34.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search results for “Tank Man” after Microsoft addressed the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EXBNXH"&gt;Bing’s presence in China is somewhat complicated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18195200/microsoft-bing-search-engine-blocked-in-china-internet-censorship"&gt;The search engine disappeared&lt;/a&gt; from the country for nearly a day in 2019 seemingly because China Unicom, the state-owned telecom company, was ordered to block it, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/714ac466-1f64-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft did not disclose the cause of the outage, but service was eventually restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp3nc6"&gt;Google’s experienced issues exploring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17981834/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-china-project-dragonfly-wired25-summit"&gt;a modified version of Google Search&lt;/a&gt; for China, but faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134563/human-rights-amnesty-google-dragonfly-china-search"&gt;harsh pushback from employees&lt;/a&gt; and US regulators over how the product could impact users in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGwdGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlcEAN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
