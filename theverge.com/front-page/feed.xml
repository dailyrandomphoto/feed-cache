    <title>Obscenely detailed scan lets you peer at Rembrandt’s Night Watch masterpiece online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJRM5TxLz0rDUJ6K2ogLHSUNHic=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373546/Operation_Night_Watch___Rijksmuseum_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The level of detail is staggering.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hpNkdV"&gt;The Rijksmuseum has released what it claims is the “largest and most detailed photograph of any artwork,” and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo"&gt;viewable for free on its website&lt;/a&gt;. The scan is of Rembrandt van Rijn’s 1642 masterpiece &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;, a roughly 12 by 14 foot painting which is currently the focus of a massive research and restoration project called “Operation Night Watch.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbqF0C"&gt;The technical details of the scan are staggering. In a &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/press/press-releases/rijksmuseum-publishes-717-gigapixel-photograph-of-the-night-watch"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Rijksmuseum explains that it’s made up of 8,439 individual photographs taken with a 100 megapixel Hasselblad H6D 400 MS camera. Neural networks were reportedly used to check each image for color and sharpness, and an AI system helped stitch these photos together into a single image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y2s8z"&gt;The result is a 717 gigapixel image that’s 5.6 terabytes in size, where each of its pixels shows an area just 5 micrometers in size on the original painting. The museum notes that it’s four times sharper than the last scan that was put out by the museum, which was &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; 44.8 gigapixels big, and where each pixel represented a comparatively massive 20 micrometers. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrRjSLa2KTYlfwxVNUXao0G5mic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160429/Operation_Night_Watch___Rijksmuseum__2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rijksmuseum&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enhance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IvjwdM"&gt;The impact is a little mind-boggling, allowing you to zoom in to see the cracks that have appeared in the individual brush strokes of this masterpiece. Arguably it’s an even better experience than seeing the painting in the flesh, since this software allows you to really press your nose up against it in a way that would get you thrown out of most museums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7ulKE"&gt;If you’re willing to sacrifice a bit of resolution, then the website also has an &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-including-missing-pieces"&gt;alternative version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548402/rembrandt-night-watch-uncropped-artificial-intelligence-rijksmuseum"&gt;missing cropped sides&lt;/a&gt; restored. These sections were stripped from the painting in 1715, allowing it to fit in a more cramped location in Amsterdam’s City Hall. These missing segments were restored last year based on a 17th-century copy of the original painting made by Gerrit Lundens. This work was also completed as part of the same Operation Night Watch project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="525OyY"&gt;The Rijksmuseum’s press release notes that this scan will help with research of the painting, especially remotely. It should also allow researchers to track how the painting ages going forward with more accuracy. With the scan complete, the museum notes that it now plans to mount &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch&lt;/em&gt; onto a new stretcher to correct deformities in the canvas that have appeared, and that it will consider other “conservation treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOeTDR"&gt;The high resolution scan of &lt;em&gt;The Night Watch &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo"&gt;viewable here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-including-missing-pieces"&gt;version with its missing sides is here&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s got you in the mood for looking at more high-resolution scans of classic works of art, check out this 10 gigapixel scan of &lt;a href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/"&gt;Johannes Vermeer’s &lt;em&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s funding threatened by Marco Rubio after ‘humiliating apologies’ to China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2019 ChinaJoy In Shanghai" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lv2Pmwe2gIPLHKM-YfqSMQKyUQQ=/0x0:4896x3264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373467/1165707843.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Visual China Group via Getty Images/Visual China Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a31M0j"&gt;US Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has threatened the government funding of chipmaker Intel after the company made what Rubio described as “humiliating apologies” to China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mj86fj"&gt;Intel issued apologies to its Chinese partners and the Chinese public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods#comments"&gt;last December&lt;/a&gt; after it noted in a routine letter to suppliers that it would not use “labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region.” This stipulation is &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2021/12/23/biden-signs-the-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-into-law/"&gt;required by US law&lt;/a&gt; as part of trading sanctions against China for its ongoing persecution of the Xinjiang region’s Uyghur population (which the US government has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/trump-china-xinjiang.html"&gt;designated a genocide&lt;/a&gt;). Intel’s letter to suppliers, though, went viral in China, and caused a huge public backlash against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNyJtR"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods#"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last year, Intel not only issued public apologies but also deleted all references to Xinjiang on its website. When asked about this deletion, Intel’s senior director of corporate comms, William Moss, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;: “We amended some language based on concerns from stakeholders to focus on broadly and globally applicable principles and policies, consistent with our general practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3B65"&gt;In response to Intel’s actions, Rubio &lt;a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=D0696334-4F97-413F-B7CB-E45AE5DF0625"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; on Monday: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="njANRu"&gt;“Intel’s cowardice is yet another predictable consequence of economic reliance on China. Instead of humiliating apologies and self-censorship, companies should move their supply chains to countries that do not use slave labor or commit genocide. If companies like Intel continue to obscure the facts about US law just to appease the Chinese Communist Party then they should be ineligible for any funding under the CHIPS Act.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ugxEvn"&gt;The CHIPS Act is a reaction to the global shortage of semiconductors and the United States’ dwindling ability to manufacture these vital components. CHIPS was enacted last year as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/07/1062192097/house-passes-ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act"&gt;annual military funding bill&lt;/a&gt; (the National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA), with the Senate authorizing $52 billion in federal investments to go to “domestic semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing provisions.” However, that funding is only speculative as of right now, as despite broad bipartisan backing the legislation is &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/chips-manufacturing-congress-subsidy"&gt;currently stalled in Congress&lt;/a&gt;. That means Rubio’s threat to Intel is, itself, only hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Redownload your Harry Potter e-books from Pottermore before they disappear for good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HDtZaV-StBEChlLYHYap5Uu0jQ=/0x1:1277x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373453/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.09.22_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An email sent to customers warning them about the change.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Pottermore&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBNziK"&gt;If you own digital Harry Potter books purchased on Pottermore, you might want to redownload your copies before the option disappears for good at the end of the month. The site is emailing its customers to warn them that the books will no longer be available to redownload after January 31st, since being removed from sale in September last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwyWkM"&gt;When it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/28/7928325/harry-potter-ebook-oyster-subsciption-service"&gt;launched back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Pottermore was the only official way to download digital copies of the Harry Potter books. Despite big stores like Amazon running promotions for the titles, which are some of the best-selling books of all time, stores would funnel customers to Pottermore to complete the sale (retailers like Amazon reportedly still got a cut, however). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TZIUKa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey, remember when they forced Amazon to require users to buy e-books through Pottermore to read Harry Potter on a Kindle? &lt;a href="https://t.co/bj6ydScp5S"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bj6ydScp5S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan C. Gordon (@icculus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1479635293099671555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v7wJtL"&gt;But sales of the e-books &lt;a href="https://www.scotsman.com/regions/harry-potter-digital-arm-loses-ps6m-and-sheds-jobs-2461743"&gt;reportedly declined over the years&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2015 they were made available directly from other online stores. Digitally enhanced editions launched on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9477815/harry-potter-apple-ibooks-enhanced-edition"&gt;Apple’s e-books store in October 2015&lt;/a&gt;, and releases on other digital stores like Amazon followed later that year. Pottermore eventually &lt;a href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/a-new-wizarding-world-website"&gt;morphed into WizardingWorld.com&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vo3loS"&gt;Although the option to redownload existing book purchases from Pottermore will disappear for good at the end of the month, it shouldn’t be too hard to hold on to your existing digital copy. On Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1479637303433867272"&gt;Ryan C. Gordon notes&lt;/a&gt; that existing downloads consist of a DRM-free .epub file, which you should be able to transfer to any new e-readers in the future (though you have to &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/ebook-readers/41944/how-to-put-free-ebooks-on-your-amazon-kindle"&gt;convert the .epub file&lt;/a&gt; to make it readable on a Kindle). Just be sure to stash the file somewhere safe if you don’t want to pay again for books you already own in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Pumped gets a new, longer teaser with more Uber shenanigans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fAghgQjZ0KftSAQtBmgzNQYE4X4=/398x0:2129x1154/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372719/Screen_Shot_2022_01_10_at_17.09.58.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Travis Kalanick in the show’s first season.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T9tNdD"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfuFRgGVM8U"&gt;a new teaser&lt;/a&gt; for the first season of &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, Showtime’s upcoming anthology show about Silicon Valley startups that hit it big. As we saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/2021/12/23/22851481/uber-showtime-series-super-pumped-trailer-joseph-gordon-levitt"&gt;in the teaser from December&lt;/a&gt;, season one will revolve around Uber and its former CEO Travis Kalanick, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOWKPE"&gt;The show’s first story will be based on the book that’s also named &lt;em&gt;Super Pumped&lt;/em&gt;, which was written by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter Mike Issac. It’ll follow the, in the trailer’s words, “wild, loud, cocky, shady, reckless, excessive, ridiculous, damaging, outrageous” story of Uber’s founder, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15844836/uber-ceo-resigns-travis-kalanick"&gt;resigned from his role as CEO in 2017&lt;/a&gt; after investors demanded change following a series of controversies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uy6gqz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NfuFRgGVM8U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZFa10"&gt;This new trailer contains some quotable moments, including one where someone asks “is this legal?” and is met with laughter. Then, there’s the line delivered by Kyle Chandler, who plays early Uber investor and former board member Bill Gurley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6iKq8Y"&gt;The best thing about Travis is that he is willing to run through walls to win. The worst thing about him is he thinks everything is a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ivxsxJ"&gt;And, of course, there’s the line delivered by Gordon-Levitt himself, where he name-drops the show. “Are we super pumped?” he yells at a cheering crowd. If you’re super... excited for the show, it premieres on February 27th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting a hotfix for the game’s epic but frustrating 12-player matchmaking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c9HInsU4CzaqMauVIRmGkXJMpXM=/0x0:1796x1197/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372705/halo_infinite_keyart_primary_horiz_9e788e276ba740e3af6451ef073fd3de.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ML7gN1"&gt;Having trouble connecting to a big game of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer with a bunch of your friends in the game’s 12-person-per-side Big Team Battle mode? That will hopefully soon be a thing of the past: developer 343 says it’s not only aware, it believes it has “a fix in hand for the core issue” and will release a special hotfix specifically for it. “It’s a little too soon to give an ETA yet but please know our goal is to release this as soon as we can,” &lt;a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/halo-infinite-update-btb-and-more-jan-10/490385?u=ske7ch"&gt;write the developers in an official blog post&lt;/a&gt;,” adding that “It won’t be this week, but we hope it’s not too much further out and we’ll share an update as soon as we have line of sight on a release date (once we clear ‘cert’ we are then ready to ship).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vmuwV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is the best thing that’s happened to me and my gaming buddies in years. It doesn’t matter how many people are down, it doesn’t matter if they’re on PC or console, and it doesn’t cost a cent — the game’s free cross-platform Big Team Battle multiplayer mode lets &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of us dive into an epic game filled with plasma explosions, grappling hooks, nail-biting gunplay and vehicular mayhem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9FE1Ge"&gt;Theoretically, anyway. Most of the time we’re twiddling our thumbs, waiting for a match to load, only for Microsoft’s servers to spontaneously disconnect (or even ban) a couple members of our fireteam because the matchmaking service can’t seem to connect the dots — and doing that again and again until we magically luck out. Yesterday evening, we finally made one of our friends the fireteam leader and &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got six of us together in matches, but even then the servers split some of us up with randos instead of friends. Once one of us quit for the evening, another player weirdly didn’t make it into the game. When we quit in solidarity, our fireteam leader got banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q93Dp2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Cheaters are already ruining Halo Infinite multiplayer games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"},{"title":"Halo Infinite’s creators say your wildest stunts are part of the series’ DNA","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22827053/halo-infinite-developers-wild-stunts-series-dna"},{"title":"Halo Infinite campaign review: playing the hits","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ml2zHH"&gt;Can’t wait for this to get fixed! Most of my group’s favorite multiplayer games require precisely 3, 4 or 6 players to work properly, so Halo’s been a breath of fresh air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwSy2"&gt;343 says it’s also planning on a second patch in mid-February that should address “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807663/halo-infinite-cheating-hackers-aimbot-wallhacks-problems"&gt;some issues with instances of cheating&lt;/a&gt;” and possibly “wonkiness with the ranked experience” among other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCQ6eZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; already added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829744/halo-infinite-playlists-slayer"&gt;some additional multiplayer playlists&lt;/a&gt; for four-player fireteams; I’m hoping once the Big Team Battle bugs are worked out, we can get some more variety in 12-player games, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jeGIxq"&gt;Meta, the parent company of Facebook, will require staffers to have received a COVID-19 booster shot to be able to work from its US offices, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-owner-to-mandate-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-for-office-workers-delay-reopening-11641852001?st=dpc5i90mrknpv99&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meta had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;already said&lt;/a&gt; that US office employees would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when they returned to the office, but beginning March 28th, they’ll also need proof of a booster vaccine, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company is also delaying its full office reopening until March 28th, pushing back a return that had been previously set for &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-will-offer-office-deferral-program-for-employees-unready-to-return-11638920387?mod=article_inline"&gt;the end of this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EustQ8"&gt;Not all Meta employees will have to return to the office on March 28th. Those who want to come back can defer their return by three to five months, a policy that was first announced &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/rto-meta-lyft-delayed"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also letting staffers request &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;to work remotely full time&lt;/a&gt;. Employees will now have until March 14th to decide if they want to come back to the office, defer their return, or request full time remote work, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5ysKAQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes are being announced as COVID-19 case counts are surging across the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HR2mKi"&gt;The changes are being announced as COVID-19 case counts &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/01/09/us-case-count-live-covid-updates/9146794002/"&gt;are surging across the US&lt;/a&gt;, forcing companies and organizations to shift their plans for in-person gatherings. The rising cases caused many companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;pull their physical presences from this year’s CES&lt;/a&gt;, and the conference itself was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861669/ces-2022-ends-early-covid-january-7"&gt;closed a day early&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, both the Grammy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22869140/grammys-sundance-film-festival-postponed-virtual-omicron-coronavirus"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt;; the Grammys have been postponed due in part to concerns about the omicron variant, while Sundance canceled the in-person programming for its 2022 event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InWd7Z"&gt;Other big tech companies have also recently shifted their office reopening plans. Apple indefinitely delayed its return to work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838471/apple-delays-office-reopening-date-covid-19"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, pushing back a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;previously-set February 1st reopening&lt;/a&gt;. Google had planned to keep in-office work voluntary until today, January 10th, but the company pushed that back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814879/google-return-to-office-covid-omicron-hybrid-work-plans-2022"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would wait until 2022 to make more return to office plans. Microsoft gave up predicting an office reopening date &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664284/microsoft-office-reopening-plans-us"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, and Amazon announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721096/amazon-work-from-home-policy-teams-decide-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that it would let individual teams decide when they would return to offices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google exec says Apple is ‘holding back’ customers who text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4LltNBE5S-g1C6kXU8Tt28q8GVI=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372410/vpavic_190508_3403_0377.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ubml4b"&gt;On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer"&gt;accused Apple of “using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products&lt;/a&gt;,” after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; revealed how US teens have turned Apple’s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6YMP"&gt;Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777"&gt;said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that “we’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hhiPL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We’re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663650775883777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alkhQP"&gt;“By not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1480663659135176705"&gt;adds Lockheimer&lt;/a&gt;, later in the Twitter thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgvZlc"&gt;That’s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446193676883922953%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715696%2Fsvp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;accept Google’s olive branch&lt;/a&gt; to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOt9Oq"&gt;On the lock-in front, there’s little question about Apple’s motivation. Thanks to the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the world has now seen confidential emails&lt;/a&gt; between Apple executives that show  the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. “I am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043920-2013-april-federighi-and-schiller-tell-cue-not-to-bring-imessage-to-android-lockin/#document/p2"&gt;wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013&lt;/a&gt;, adding “I think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWOCzA"&gt;“Joz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,” &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043935-2016-march-phil-schiller-why-imessage-lockin-is-important/#document/p1"&gt;wrote Apple’s Phil Schiller in March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he “missed a ton of messages from friends and family” after switching to an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCGNOG"&gt;What’s less clear is whether RCS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"&gt;the next-gen replacement for SMS that’s championed by Google&lt;/a&gt; and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That’s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6U1Fmm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Let’s chat about RCS","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783220/vergecast-podcast-rcs-explainer-google"},{"title":"The moral case for iMessage on Android","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"},{"title":"Why I turned on iMessage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="nMgnBN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715696/svp-android-invitation-apple-rcs-texting-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS &lt;em&gt;literally years &lt;/em&gt;with no comment&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re not holding our breath. We’ve also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/6/18171021/moral-case-imessage-android"&gt;the moral case&lt;/a&gt; that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677644/imessage-iphone-apple-secure-encrypted-chat-moral-imperative-signal-rcs-hangouts"&gt;the personal plight of dealing with Apple’s inaction&lt;/a&gt;. (And when I say “we”, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I’m writing this post because he’s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren’t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvKptQ"&gt;But maybe now that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22828277/apple-3-trillion-market-cap-company-earnings"&gt;is basically a three-trillion dollar company&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22807871/apple-frontline-employees-retail-customer-service-pandemic"&gt;its employees are speaking out&lt;/a&gt;, and pieces like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ’s&lt;/em&gt; are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;larger than simply scaling up the company&lt;/a&gt; to become the most valuable in the world with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871202/tim-cook-2021-pay-package-compensation-proxy"&gt;a fat pay package&lt;/a&gt; as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrmWgg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 7:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was “No comment.” I regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Associated Press is starting its own NFT marketplace for photojournalism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKxls6x43ADMtaVsgwa9QHS38zI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372369/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resellers will also be to get in on the action.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lb3R8D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2022/ap-to-launch-nft-marketplace-built-by-xooa"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s starting &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/join-waiting-list"&gt;a marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to sell NFTs of its photojournalists’ work in collaboration with a company called Xooa. It’s billing its foray into NFTs as a way for collectors to “purchase the news agency’s award-winning contemporary and historic photojournalism” and says that the virtual tokens will be released at “broad and inclusive price points” (though it’s hard to tell what types of prices resellers will want on the &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; marketplace).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU7r2Y"&gt;The news outlet says its system will be built on the “environmentally friendly” Polygon blockchain and that the NFTs will “include a rich set of original metadata” to tell buyers when, where, and how the photos were taken. It says its first collection, launching January 31st, will include NFTs featuring photos of “space, climate, war and other images to spotlights on the work of specific &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; photographers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rtdZob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Other journalistic enterprises have experimented with NFTs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q52GQ2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first journalistic enterprise to use or express interest in NFTs. &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1984094/quartz-is-selling-the-first-ever-nft-news-article/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quartz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350663/new-york-times-nft-auction-half-million-dollar-article-charity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have sold copies of their articles as NFTs, and Getty Images’ CEO Craig Peters &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-12-10/getty-images-ceo-talks-nft-aspirations-after-4-8-billion-deal-with-blank-check-company"&gt;said in December&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “a real opportunity” for the company when it comes to NFTs. We probably won’t see people debating whether to get a Getty or an &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; NFT anytime soon, though, as the former seems to be taking a more wait-and-see approach, with Peters saying that he didn’t feel the need to race into the space. So far, though, this does seem like one of the largest NFT-related efforts from a major news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDCRHT"&gt;It doesn’t seem like &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is trying to sell its NFTs as a metaverse tie-in (either as part of a virtual museum or as decorations in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/accounting-firms-scoop-up-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse-11641599590"&gt;an online accounting office&lt;/a&gt;), like other media executives &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/plugged-in-executives-metaverse/"&gt;in the music industry may be interested in doing&lt;/a&gt;. Its announcement and &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/faq"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; make no mention of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt; (outside of mentioning that Xooa also works with brands on “metaverse strategies” in the “About Xooa” section), and the project seems entirely aimed at collectors who want to, as the press release puts it, “seamlessly buy, sell and trade official &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; digital collectibles through the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="zw4RP2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Pulitzer Drops” will “have increased scarcity to preserve their status”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7K4Mrn"&gt;Buyers will be able to pay for NFTs from the market using either credit cards or Ethereum — &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says the MetaMask will be the first wallet supported but that there are plans to add support for others. There will be virtual queues to buy NFTs as they’re released by &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt;, with “Pulitzer Drops” containing more limited-edition NFTs happening every two weeks — the FAQ says these particular images will “have increased scarcity to preserve their status.” Buyers will be able to resell those NFTs on the site’s secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCVP3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says that the proceeds from the NFTs’ sale will be used to fund its journalistic endeavors. It’ll also get revenue whenever they’re resold on its marketplace — the FAQ says there’s a 10 percent fee associated with reselling, and Xooa spokesperson Lauren Easton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email that the two companies would share that fee. (The transaction fees, or “gas” fees, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency"&gt;Ethereum is infamous for&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t add too much to the price of sales, as they’re significantly lower on Polygon.) Easton also told us that the “photographers will share in all revenue collected,” but didn't specify what their cut would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpjPKh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The marketplace has an early access waitlist scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GGIuPM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; says its marketplace is set to open on January 31st, but it does seem to be offering a sort of early access scheme; the landing page for the marketplace says you can get on a waitlist and that you can get “priority access” and a higher waitlist ranking if you refer others to sign up. If you’re the type of collector &lt;em&gt;AP&lt;/em&gt; is targeting with these offerings (or you’re someone interested in how this type of marketplace will work), it’s worth doing a thorough read of &lt;a href="https://apmarket.xooa.com/p/faq"&gt;the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; — it gets into how Xooa is planning on adding support for moving the NFTs to other marketplaces, talks about how the drops will work, and has tons of detail about the marketplace, account system, and the seller verification processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LAPD officers fired for catching a Snorlax instead of a burglar denied appeal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rer0PyatBZDHTwHsSZHjCujTaaQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70372301/pokemoncop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDv3HK"&gt;Two LAPD officers who were fired from their jobs in 2017 for playing Pokémon Go while on duty have had their appeal for reinstatement denied by a California judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QL48om"&gt;The officers’ squad car video camera showed the two officers, Louis Lozano and Eric Mitchell, ignored a request for backup to play the game, according to court documents. The pair were stationed near a robbery in progress, and after the responding officers put out a call for backup, Lozano and Mitchell seemingly ignored the call and left the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBxO2u"&gt;When asked later why they hadn’t responded to the call, the two officers said they were in a loud area and couldn’t hear their radio. Lozano and Mitchell’s supervisor was skeptical of their explanation and checked the in-car recording system (commonly known as a dashcam), which revealed the two had heard the call and chose to go elsewhere as they didn’t want to help. The supervisor reported the incident, which opened a formal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAhf2Q"&gt;According to court filings, an extensive review of the in-car video system revealed that shortly after leaving the scene of the robbery, the two officers could be heard discussing Pokémon Go, including a Snorlax that had appeared and the best route to intercept and catch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y4Q0BC"&gt;For approximately the next 20 minutes, the [in-car video system] captured petitioners discussing Pokémon as they drove to different locations where the virtual creatures apparently appeared on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slfX0b"&gt;When confronted, the officers denied they were playing Pokémon Go and said they were just having a conversation. They tried to appeal on the grounds that the in-vehicle recordings were not meant to be used to monitor officers’ “private conversations,” but a judge ruled that that premise was ”flawed” and denied the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lX89e"&gt;T-Mobile appears to be blocking some iPhone users from enabling iCloud Private Relay, a feature that lets you hide the websites you visit from third parties, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/t-mobile-block-icloud-private-relay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The block doesn’t appear to be malicious, however — without it, some T-Mobile services couldn’t operate, &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;via a subscription to iCloud Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwCA9M"&gt;Private Relay is still in beta in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, and it isn’t turned on by default. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;You have to go into your iPhone’s settings to switch it on&lt;/a&gt;, which is where some T-Mobile customers have noticed a strange message popping up. As shown in the above tweet, the user is presented with the message, “Your cellular plan doesn’t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z095du"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guidryjd/status/1480631410239094797?s=20"&gt;a reply to that tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the user shows what happens when you click the “Learn More” button below the initial message — there, Apple explains why T-Mobile might be blocking the feature. “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay,” it reads. “Your cellular provider may be providing network-based services, such as Parental Controls, requiring them to view the traffic on your network.” An &lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;internal note shared with &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oYDJF"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The T-Mo Report, &lt;/em&gt;iCloud Private Relay conflicts with a number of T-Mobile services. Notably, Private Relay conflicts with T-Mobile customers using Web Guard, and Sprint and Home Office Internet customers who enable content filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4ZROa"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/10/european-carriers-seek-to-block-iphone-private-relay-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;iPhone users in Europe were the first to notice that access to the Private Relay feature had been blocked. T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica added their names to an open letter published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F10%2F22877211%2Ft-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that criticizes the feature. Carriers argue that Private Relay “will impair others to innovate and compete in downstream digital markets and may negatively impact operators’ ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7LADr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to T-Mobile and Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWnp0v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 11th, 4:48AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tmo.report/2022/01/t-mobile-blocking-icloud-private-relay-for-some-but-its-not-what-you-think/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;reporting by The T-Mo Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
