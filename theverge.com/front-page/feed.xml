    <title>You’ll be able to pay for Amazon purchases with Venmo starting in 2022</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4Wk7H"&gt;If you want to buy anything on Amazon.com, you’ll generally need a credit or debit card — but in 2022, the online retailer will begin accepting Venmo as well. Venmo parent company PayPal &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-11-08-PayPal-and-Amazon-to-Enable-Customers-to-Pay-with-Venmo-at-Checkout"&gt;announced the news&lt;/a&gt; during its Q3 earnings call on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkUVAB"&gt;We’re pretty sure that’s the first third-party payments platform Amazon has embraced in recent memory. You can’t use PayPal itself to buy things on Amazon! (Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GFBWMNXEPYVJAY9A"&gt;a list of the payment methods Amazon does accept&lt;/a&gt; as of today). You might cite Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/amazon-partners-with-affirm"&gt;recent buy-now, pay-later partnership with Affirm&lt;/a&gt;, but that still requires credit. Venmo, by comparison, acts more like a bank account for some mobile users, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213387/venmo-check-cashing-paypal-customers-banking"&gt;complete with a (sometimes expensive) check-cashing feature.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7IkRW"&gt;Details on the Amazon partnership are scarce right now, but if you’ve got a US Venmo account, PayPal says you’ll be able to use it to make purchases at both Amazon’s website and its mobile app starting in 2022, and you’ll be able to use either your Venmo balance or a linked bank account to pay. The company didn’t provide a more specific timeframe or any details about how those transactions might work. It’s possible that Amazon will surface it as a full-fledged payment mechanism by offering an entire Pay with Venmo option, or it’s possible it will try to maintain more control by requiring you to integrate Venmo with its own Amazon Wallet. (Maybe you’ll have to deposit Venmo money into your Amazon balance first?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xkw3r"&gt;Venmo, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357246/paypal-buy-with-bitcoin-litecoin-ethereum-crypto-checkout"&gt;like PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, recently added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392274/venmo-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-hold-bitcoin"&gt;support for popular cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear if that will allow you to effectively purchase Amazon items with cryptocurrency, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNuLnj"&gt;On PayPal’s Q3 earnings call, the company stated that while the PayPal portion is still larger than Venmo, the Venmo business has now grown as large as the entire PayPal US footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic sells 100 tickets to space at higher price after reopening sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8E0yJT5dcbVeCvdQWKojcQYfmXI=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114097/1233923008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBzVKV"&gt;Space tourism venture Virgin Galactic says that 100 people purchased more expensive tickets to fly on the company’s suborbital spaceplane after it reopened ticket sales this August. That means that the company has roughly 700 ticket holders now for quick tourist trips to space, about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic hoped to sell ahead of starting commercial flights of its vehicles. The company announced the news &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;during its third-quarter earnings release out on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwhnjZ"&gt;Virgin Galactic reopened ticket sales just a month after the company successfully flew its founder, billionaire Richard Branson, to the edge of space and back on the company’s primary spaceplane, called &lt;em&gt;VSS Unity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in July. Taking off from Spaceport America in New Mexico, Branson flew with two test pilots and three other passengers, reaching a height of more than 53 miles before returning back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bt01s4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;about 300 less than the 1,000 tickets Virgin Galactic hoped to sell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WVKWv9"&gt;The flight was a major spectacle, hastily scheduled nine days before rival Blue Origin flew &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; founder, Jeff Bezos, to the edge of space and back. And at the time, it was seemingly a major success. But in September, a story in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;revealed that Branson’s flight had actually deviated from its approved flight path when it returned to Earth. The Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654516/spaceshiptwo-richard-branson-faa-virgin-galactic"&gt;temporarily grounded Virgin Galactic as the agency investigated&lt;/a&gt; the incident but ultimately resolved the issue and cleared the company to fly again in mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3zSEP"&gt;Before the investigation came to light, Virgin Galactic decided to reopen ticket sales, arguing that there had been a “surge in consumer interest following” Branson’s flight. The company opted to list tickets at $450,000, significantly higher than the $250,000 price tag during Virgin Galactic’s initial ticketing round years ago. Additionally, Virgin Galactic had been targeting to fly its next mission with people in September — a flight called Unity 23 that will carry three members of the Italian Air Force. It’s meant to be Virgin Galactic’s first revenue-generating mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxYUdV"&gt;But in early September, Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Provides-Update-on-Unity-23-Test-Flight/default.aspx"&gt;announced a delay to Unity 23&lt;/a&gt; after a third-party supplier “flagged a potential manufacturing defect in a component of the flight control actuation system” that it supplies to the company. Virgin Galactic opted to put the flight on hold and do inspections of its fleet to see if the defect was present in its vehicles. Along with &lt;em&gt;VSS Unity&lt;/em&gt;, Virgin Galactic rolled out another vehicle, &lt;em&gt;VSS Imagine, &lt;/em&gt;in March, and the company is working on another vehicle called &lt;em&gt;VSS Inspire&lt;/em&gt;. Then in October, the company announced that it would not resume commercial flight operations &lt;a href="https://investors.virgingalactic.com/news/news-details/2021/Virgin-Galactic-Begins-Planned-Vehicle-Enhancement-and-Modification-Period-Unity-23-Test-Flight-Rescheduled-to-Follow-Completion-of-This-Program/default.aspx"&gt;until the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;, more than a year after Branson’s flight. &lt;em&gt;VSS Imagine&lt;/em&gt; will not attempt its first glide flight until early 2023. That means Virgin Galactic’s customers could be waiting a while before they see space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r094OE"&gt;In its earnings report, Virgin Galactic also revealed that it had made $2.6 million in revenue this quarter but netted a total loss of $48 million, down from the $94 million net loss the company suffered in the second quarter of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PzAaL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood says a hacker who tried to extort the company got access to data for 7 million customers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adiDT19QxumRrD2ILB0igeaR9TE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70114077/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Robinhood says more than 7 million customers affected by ‘data security incident’&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt; | Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aXtNfP"&gt;Trading platform Robinhood said Monday that personal information for more than 7 million customers was accessed during a data breach on November 3rd. The company &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; that it does not appear that Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed, and no customers have had “financial loss” due to the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr5Fze"&gt;An unauthorized third party “socially engineered a customer support employee by phone,” Robinhood said, and was able to access its customer support systems. The attacker was able to get a list of email addresses for approximately 5 million people and full names for a separate group of 2 million people. For a smaller group of about 310 people, additional personal information, including names, dates of birth, and zip codes, was exposed, and for about 10 customers, “more extensive account details” were revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRYKKq"&gt;The company did not provide further information about what those “extensive” details were, but a spokesperson said in response to a query from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that even for those 10 customers, “we believe that no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed.” The spokesperson declined to say whether any of the customers may have been specifically targeted in the hack, but the company said it was in the process of notifying those who had been affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOpeQb"&gt;“Following a diligent review, putting the entire Robinhood community on notice of this incident now is the right thing to do,” Robinhood chief security officer Caleb Sima said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCMr2a"&gt;After it was able to contain the attack, Robinhood said the unauthorized third party sought an “extortion payment,” and the company notified law enforcement but did not say whether it had made any payments. Robinhood enlisted the help of outside security firm Mandiant as it investigates the incident. Charles Carmakal, CTO of Mandiant, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had “recently observed this threat actor in a limited number of security incidents, and we expect they will continue to target and extort other organizations over the next several months.” He did not elaborate further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdUO1y"&gt;Customers seeking information about whether their accounts were affected should visit the help center on the company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="obBPd9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MPMc8F"&gt;Robinhood has had a rocky 2021 so far; in January, it halted trading as Redditors helped push up the prices of so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Theaters. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22290110/house-financial-services-robinhood-gamestop-squeeze-roaringkitty-hearing"&gt;incidents led to a congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; where CEO Vlad Tenev testified along with Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and trader Keith Gill aka RoaringKitty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dnU1g"&gt;The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600570/robinhood-ipo-retail-investors"&gt;trading on the Nasdaq exchange in July&lt;/a&gt;, with the worst market debut among 51 US firms that raised as much money or more than Robinhood, according to data from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/robinhood-flirts-with-worst-debut-ever-for-ipo-of-its-size"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; In its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559438/robinhood-ipo-dogecoin-hood-revenue-2021"&gt;S-1 filing&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood acknowledged a recent SEC Enforcement Division inquiry and that the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California had executed a search warrant for Tenev’s phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker expansion delayed two weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vb0yBunLIw0ZgSQ7ij814L-4_XI=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113945/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_26.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lIzM0L"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; has been delayed for two weeks, arriving December 7th instead of November 23rd. &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/543305a31fe801d5df3a29ef2cea581e00b46761"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, game director Naoki Yoshida says the delay was to ensure adequate quality assurance testing in the final days of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXfOcI"&gt;Yoshida says the decision to delay the game arose from a desire to ensure &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s story was something that befit 11 years of&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s epic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRwcK6"&gt;“We remained firmly resolved to adjust down to the smallest nuances and ensure our writing covers even the finest points of the vast and intricate story that has spanned these past 11 years since the original &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; to ensure that everyone can fully enjoy their adventure in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;,” Yoshida writes. However, the time it took to make the necessary story adjustments disrupted &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s quality assurance testing schedule. Notably, Yoshida cites the game’s stability as a major factor in postponing the game. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eI6OVI733mb3zN3MhzLXAfDW53s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996770/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_11.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Alisaie when she heard &lt;/em&gt;Endwalker&lt;em&gt; was postponed.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zzaQWe"&gt;In July, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; saw &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/c2d7b35d55577879086b64cfde0acb6c23ccd07f"&gt;a massive increase in popularity&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the digital deluxe version of the game &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-is-so-popular-even-the-digital-versio-1847272446"&gt;selling out&lt;/a&gt; and new character creation on North American servers briefly disabled. The spike in new players caused longer login queues and prompted Square Enix to kick idle players while increasing capacity in order to help with server congestion — all without a major release driving player interest. With &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; on the horizon, Yoshida wanted to ensure the game could handle what will likely be an even bigger spike in players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvNSJO"&gt;Yoshida was apologetic for the delay, &lt;a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/RoundTemperedBobaTF2John-yFh46EuFMIHtXhJt"&gt;apparently tearing up&lt;/a&gt; as he made the announcement. The beloved developer, affectionately known as Yoshi-P, said he took players’ potential inconveniences — like requesting time off to play — into account before making the difficult decision to postpone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjqHOU"&gt;“I was incredibly torn between whether or not we should cut down the expansion pack’s volume or even release content in installments,” Yoshida writes. “As such, I humbly ask you all to forgive me for the decision I’ve made.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vncPDr"&gt;The new date places &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;a day before the release of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving the first full week of December two of the biggest, most-anticipated titles of the last couple years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xQPtk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; launches on PC and PlayStation December 7th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s parent company briefly hits $2 trillion valuation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BIsdnAfgztnKGEoQW6HxcptWmEk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113691/acastro_180130_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="donwQi"&gt;Alphabet, Google’s parent company, briefly hit a market cap of $2 trillion. The tech behemoth’s market cap is currently at a comfortable &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/"&gt;$1.98 trillion&lt;/a&gt;, but crept over the $2 trillion mark midday Monday, later closing out at $2,987.03 per share. Alphabet’s market cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069458/google-alphabet-trillion-dollar-market-cap-apple-microsoft"&gt;has just about doubled from $1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; since January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYD6gc"&gt;In the third quarter of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747193/google-q3-2021-earnings-record-revenue-profit"&gt;Alphabet had a record quarter&lt;/a&gt;, earning a hefty $65.1 billion. The company reported that its revenue soared by 41 percent, while its profits jumped by almost 69 percent. Google Search saw a slight increase in profit, climbing to $37.9 billion from $35.8 billion in the previous quarter. YouTube, another Alphabet company, earned $7.2 billion in the most recent quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZfgjj"&gt;Throughout the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348652/pandemic-earnings-antitrust-google-facebook-apple-amazon"&gt;Big Tech has boomed&lt;/a&gt;, and as companies across the world shifted from in-person workplaces to remote, cloud-based work environments, Google benefited in the form of cloud storage subscriptions and digital ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0AVpq"&gt;Alphabet nearly joined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549559/microsoft-2-two-trillion-dollar-market-cap-close"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; as one of three US-based companies that are part of the exclusive $2 trillion club. Apple hit the mark in April of last year, while Microsoft reached $2 trillion this past June. Amazon is close to joining the $2 trillion club, but its current &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/"&gt;$1.7 trillion valuation&lt;/a&gt; falls just a bit short.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Wv2PC"&gt;Apple will continue to accept App Store app submissions through the holidays, marking a shift from the company’s approach in the past. Typically, Apple doesn’t let developers make submissions through the App Store Connect portal for a few days around Christmas, meaning that they would have to rush to release apps or updates ahead of when many people receive new Apple devices or gift cards as holiday presents. With this change, it seems as if the App Store will hum along largely like you’re used to this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6TMFv"&gt;However, Apple is already suggesting that developers try to stay ahead of things during one of the busiest times of the year. “Due to anticipated high volume, plan to send time-sensitive submissions early,” Apple said in a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe&amp;amp;1636388143"&gt;short post on its developer website&lt;/a&gt;. “Please note that reviews may take longer to complete from November 24 to 28 and December 23 to 27.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Controversial Bitcoin tax provision passes Congress with infrastructure bill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBfPD6gJ2r7V2wGpR8sGHc61FQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113609/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S8EPb5"&gt;On Friday, Congress passed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature. But while the measure makes historic investments in roads and bridges, it also maintains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22631096/cryptocurrency-tax-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-advocacy-jack-dorsey-ashton-kutcher"&gt;a controversial new cryptocurrency tax reporting requirement&lt;/a&gt; that the Treasury Department could apply to miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sxotp"&gt;Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires brokers to report trader information on transactions of more than $10,000 to the IRS. The provision was added to the Senate version of the bill in late July after the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would offset $28 billion of infrastructure costs over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jIET6t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it would offset $28 billion of infrastructure costs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MlfN2"&gt;But the cryptocurrency community is more concerned about how the bill defines a “broker” more than the new tax requirements it imposes on them. Industry groups and think tanks, like the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center, have argued that the bill’s current language is “too broad and vague” and could impose these reporting requirements to miners and wallet developers, not just brokers like Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mDWbe"&gt;Senators that are sympathetic to the cryptocurrency industry, like Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), tried to remedy the problem over the summer before the Senate passed the bill, joining with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) for an amendment clarifying the role of brokers in the legislation. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617055/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-deal-reporting-lummis-wyden-schumer"&gt;the amendment was shot down&lt;/a&gt; when Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) objected to a unanimous motion to approve it in August. Shelby previously chaired the Senate Banking Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xy9iT6"&gt;Shortly after the Senate’s passage of the bill, the bipartisan Blockchain Caucus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1424845416697323522?s=20"&gt;sent a letter to every House lawmaker&lt;/a&gt; calling on them to help fix the “crypto pay-for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWQvQd"&gt;“Cryptocurrency tax reporting is important, but it must be done correctly,” the lawmakers wrote in the August letter. “When the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act comes to the House, we must prioritize amending this language to clearly exempt noncustodial blockchain intermediaries and ensure that civil liberties are protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Aj6xA"&gt;Despite any efforts to change the language in the House, the problematic broker definition remains in the final bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZZ863"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Treasury Department will have the sole authority to decide what entities would be considered brokers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bqytrn"&gt;Once Biden signs the legislation, the Treasury Department will have the sole authority to decide what entities would be considered brokers. A Treasury official &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/treasury-will-not-target-non-brokers-even-without-crypto-tax-amendment.html"&gt;previously told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it wouldn’t target miners and hardware developers, but that promise doesn’t prevent new administrations from going after them in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNvEDt"&gt;Cryptocurrency groups are already preparing to bar the Treasury from changing its mind on miners in the future. Neeraj Agrawal, director of communication for Coin Center, said that the group would “be pursuing legislative fixes to constrain the new language more permanently” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1457726300987273223?s=20"&gt;in a tweet on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear what this remedy could look like as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QE99V1"&gt;Aside from the cryptocurrency reporting rules, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;the infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; includes billions of dollars to improve roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure across the country. The measure includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;$65 billion to connect&lt;/a&gt; every American household to high-speed broadband over the next 10 years. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22600226/bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-ev-charging-climate-change"&gt;$7.5 billion to build&lt;/a&gt; over half a million EV charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6FgRn"&gt;At a Monday White House press conference, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that the “bipartisan infrastructure deal will now become the law of the land” but declined to answer additional questions on when to expect Biden to sign the bill. The White House has yet to announce the timing for a future signing ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAl4m8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUgdlM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Bezos’ latest plan to protect forests could backfire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Day Two of COP26 Climate Change Talks World Leader’s Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFxLVkMwqamO4GIIdfoSJnj_gNI=/53x0:2948x1930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113501/1236293806.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during the Action on Forests and Land Use session at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, U.K., on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Robert Perry/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qcS7dk"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ $2 billion plan, announced last week, to plant trees and restore landscapes across Africa and the US has already raised red flags for some conservation experts and activists. Last year, after he pledged &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;$10 billion&lt;/a&gt; to fight climate change, activists in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;called him out&lt;/a&gt; for not doing enough to cut down Amazon’s pollution or work with local communities while crafting his environmental plans. This time, he’s facing similar criticisms on a global scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4WmjR"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund &lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest round of funding on November 1 during a high-profile United Nations climate summit taking place in Glasgow. There aren’t many details out yet, but the fund says it will funnel $1 billion towards planting trees and “revitalizing” grasslands in Africa, as well as restoring 20 different landscapes across the US. The other $1 billion will support sustainable agriculture initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9pEfX"&gt;The hope with the new conservation investment is to preserve ecosystems that naturally draw down and store planet-heating carbon dioxide pollution. That builds on a commitment Bezos made in September to spend $1 billion to create and manage so-called “protected” areas for conservation. The Bezos Earth Fund also says it wants local communities and Indigenous peoples “placed at the heart of conservation programs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mQxvJU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The worst-case scenario is they do a lot of damage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EscxjA"&gt;But without safeguards in place, the initiative could potentially harm ecosystems and infringe on local and Indigenous peoples’ rights, some experts say. Instead of flinging money into these projects, they’d rather see Bezos cut pollution from the behemoth businesses he’s founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giNOkY"&gt;“Organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund have tended to sort of hire people in Seattle to fix Africa. And that doesn’t work,” says Forrest Fleischman, who teaches natural resources policy at the University of Minnesota. “Sort of the best-case scenario [with inexperienced donors] is that they waste all the money, and the worst-case scenario is they do a lot of damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuvFn4"&gt;There are heated debates flaring up right now around how to conserve and restore ecosystems. That’s, in part, because of a stream of splashy, new projects to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss. Last year, for instance, the World Economic Forum launched an initiative to plant a trillion trees. That was met with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign"&gt;pushback&lt;/a&gt; from a cadre of forestry and conservation experts, who warned that aggressive tree-planting campaigns have, at times, led to monocrops of a single species of tree. Those tree farms don’t offer the same kinds of ecological benefits as natural forests that are teeming with diverse species. They might even harm ecosystems by putting a lot of trees where they don’t belong, like in savannas and grasslands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2zCoL"&gt;“Many believe that nothing bad can possibly come from planting trees, but planting trees ...in grasslands and savannas does irreversible damage to grasslands and savannas,” Rhodes University ecologist Susanne Vetter wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Environmental groups like the World Resources Institute have mistakenly mapped those ecosystems as degraded forests suitable for tree planting in the past, Vetter wrote in an opinion &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.549483/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems in 2020. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBZxQE"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund said that it will work with AFR100, a partnership between 31 governments in Africa that is advised by WRI and aims to restore 100 million hectares of land across the continent by 2030. AFR100 “advocates actively against the conversion of natural ecosystems, like grasslands and savannas, into tree plantations,” a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Each country that’s part of AFR100 ultimately makes decisions based on input from experts and local communities, says Bernadette Arakwiye, a research associate for WRI based in Rwanda. The maps Vetter referenced in her paper have been updated and don’t necessarily inform decisions on which lands to restore, according to Arakwiye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcJsdq"&gt;But splashy climate change commitments like the Bezos Earth Fund can easily fall into pitfalls associated with tree planting because of their focus on speed and scale, says Prakash Kashwan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. “Designing restoration projects that are environmentally good requires working with each individual landscape based on what the landscape is like,” he says. “If our goal is to learn from indigenous engagements with nature, one fundamental principle is to slow down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BfeYMN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a history of “green-grabbing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6BTSLq"&gt;Taking the time to consult with local communities who use the land is also important because projects can also inflame old wounds inflicted upon Indigenous peoples in the name of conservation in the past. There’s a history of &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;“green-grabbing” that’s tied to colonization&lt;/a&gt; around the world. Half of “protected” areas around the world occupy lands that were once Indigenous peoples’ homes and territories, according to a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/Conservation.aspx"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples’ Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. After land has been set aside as a protected area, tribes might be pushed off their lands or could be barred from practicing traditions like hunting, even when done sustainably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4vMHt"&gt;There’s also a history of violent policing of protected areas. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), for example, funded park rangers accused of killing, raping, and torturing local and Indigenous people at African national parks and wildlife reserves, a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/wwfsecretwar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; found. In 2020, the Bezos Earth Fund awarded WWF &lt;a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/the-bezos-earth-fund-wwf-investment-in-community-and-climate#:~:text=The%20Bezos%20Earth%20Fund%20has,of%20people%20around%20the%20world."&gt;$100 million&lt;/a&gt; to protect and restore more lands.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlAg2D"&gt;Experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with have advice for how to avoid repeating the past. “This money should be targeted to wherever, to whatever local communities are already doing and think are the best approaches to [restore landscapes],” says Ida Djenontin, whose research focuses on environmental management and governance at Michigan State University and London School of Economics. Djenontin has also previously collaborated with AFR100. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that forests fare better under the care of Indigenous peoples that depend on them for their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C6U6hB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forests fare better under the care of Indigenous peoples&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqvYGX"&gt;Kashwan is concerned that even if the Bezos Earth Fund is serious about wanting to center Indigenous peoples in its conservation programs, meaningful engagement could be hampered in developing nations that lack a strong, existing framework of legal protections for tribes. “These initiatives are fundamentally flawed because all they do is to [make] declarations of good intentions,” Kashwan says. There’s no institutional mechanism for accountability across much of the Global South, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXIli5"&gt;Even in the US, there’s still work to be done to make sure environmental philanthropy efforts are mindful of vulnerable populations. The Bezos Earth Fund says that 40 percent of funds earmarked for the US will go towards projects that “directly engage or benefit underserved communities.” That comes after grassroots activists &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662529/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-150-million-climate-justice-amazon"&gt;pushed Bezos&lt;/a&gt; to invest more in communities of color disproportionately burdened with pollution. Some of those communities are still fighting for Amazon to clean up the air pollution its warehouses saddle their neighborhoods with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ICELp"&gt;Experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that perhaps the biggest impact Bezos could have would be to stop the harm Amazon does to the environment through its pollution. Even after making big pledges to tackle climate change, Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300427/amazon-climate-change-commitments-greenhouse-gas-emissions-jeff-bezos"&gt;continued to grow&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. As long as that’s the case, initiatives like Bezos Earth Fund amount to little more than corporate greenwashing, say experts like Fiore Longo, head of the conservation campaign at Survival International, a human rights organization that advocates for tribal peoples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqZrAl"&gt;Wealthy corporate figureheads, she says, “think they can just keep destroying the planet through producing emissions and then creating protected areas or planting trees somewhere and then magically, their emissions will be compensated for. In the key moment that we are in when we need real decisions for the protection of biodiversity and to stop climate change, we can’t allow ourselves this kind of distraction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5r2zF"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund declined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton finally adds a pause button for its on-demand classes on its bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buLtCNcVJt0ignuuJSkWFvnK850=/128x0:2306x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113322/Screen_Shot_2021_11_08_at_2.46.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcyOtR"&gt;Peloton has announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/pause-button/"&gt;finally added a pause button&lt;/a&gt; for its on-demand classes for its Bike and Bike Plus devices, allowing users to temporarily pause workouts in the middle of a class and then resume them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kbsBC"&gt;It’s a feature that bewilderingly hasn’t been available until today — and, technically, still isn’t even available on all of Peloton’s products, as the pause button is only rolling out to its cycling bikes for now. The Tread treadmill is set to get a similar update sometime “in the future” — but for now, you’ll have to do your runs all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IHfuG"&gt;While it’s easy to joke at Peloton’s expense for the outsized deal the company is making over adding so small a feature, it is worth noting that adding a pause button to Peloton classes &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; involve a bit more thought behind it than simply just pausing and resuming the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZwaaYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rolling out today on the Bike and Bike Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bX3zyN"&gt;That’s largely because of Peloton’s popular leaderboard and ranking system, which let customers compare how they’re doing in a particular workout against fellow Peloton users. Adding a pause button could sully the integrity of those metrics, allowing unscrupulous users to pause, catch a quick breather, and then resume the workout at maximum effort to skew their ranking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYA2yi"&gt;Pausing a workout, however, will automatically cause users to lose their rank on the leaderboard (although all the other usual metrics, challenges, achievements, and personal records will still be unchanged). Paused users will still appear on the “Here Now” list in the app and receive high fives from other Peloton users, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKDJlg"&gt;Obviously, the new pause button only works for on-demand Peloton classes and not for live classes — Peloton is a powerful force, but freezing the forward motion of temporal space and reversing the entropic march toward the universe’s inevitable heath death remain beyond its capabilities. At least, for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian will start selling electric vans to non-Amazon companies in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWZr0lgZQcjon48uXkbF9Nckass=/118x0:1558x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70113105/fleet_overlay_amazon_alzb8t.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zBm5Jo"&gt;Rivian says it will start taking orders for its electric delivery vans in 2022 and will deliver them to fleet customers in “early 2023,” calling into question the status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8PI33"&gt;The buzzy EV startup — which is slated to go public this week at a valuation of $50 billion or higher — quietly announced the details about its fleet sales plans in a &lt;a href="https://rivian.com/fleet"&gt;new section of its website that went live Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. It also said it will sell fleet versions of its R1T electric pickup truck and R1S electric SUV, meaning it will compete with Ford’s commercial version of the F-150 Lightning, as well as a fleet management platform called FleetOS and a charging infrastructure solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPySLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electric vans, plus fleet versions of the R1T and R1S, will be available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GvjywR"&gt;Selling electric delivery vans to commercial fleet customers other than Amazon could help Rivian make a lot more money in the near term, as the market for these vehicles is still wide open. But the startup runs the risk of biting off more than it can chew. Rivian’s ability to make vehicles at scale is still unproven; it has only just started making and delivering the R1T and is still preparing the delivery van for mass production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WppWmX"&gt;The fleet section of Rivian’s website was launched just one day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764212/rivian-discrimination-lawsuit-toxic-bro-culture-rj-scaringe-ipo"&gt;the company was sued by a former VP&lt;/a&gt; for alleged gender discrimination; among other things, she claimed Rivian had manufacturing quality problems and too-lofty delivery targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwfT29"&gt;Amazon and Rivian announced that they were collaborating on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;an electric delivery van in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The conglomerate said it would order up to 100,000 vans through 2024, part of the effort to decarbonize its logistics fleet. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20percent-stake-in-electric-vehicle-maker-rivian.html"&gt;recently confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"&gt;owns some 20 percent of Rivian&lt;/a&gt; after participating in multiple funding rounds before the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlooF5"&gt;When Rivian announced its plan to go public earlier this year, it shared &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488ds1a.htm#toc157488_14"&gt;further details about the deal with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488dex1013.htm"&gt;filings&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521315537/d157488dex1014.htm"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; the Securities and Exchange Commission. The two companies agreed that Amazon would have exclusive rights to the delivery van for four years after Rivian provided the first batch. Amazon would also have the right of first refusal for two years after that over any other companies that wanted to buy the vans from Rivian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0hFlJ"&gt;As a result, Rivian confessed to prospective investors that a “significant portion” of its “near-term” revenue would come from Amazon. And some were listening. “The exclusivity clause of this agreement may significantly hamper Rivian’s ability to capture market share,” equity research firm New Constructs &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rivian-amazon-deal-could-backfire-ipo-startup-2021-11"&gt;wrote in a report last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="06aEBk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s IPO filing reveals Amazon’s prime influence","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EGsFkt"&gt;Neither company would explain the current status of Amazon’s exclusive rights to Rivian’s van, though. The new section of Rivian’s site, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/4000sonnets/status/1456693374971375617"&gt;tweeted by communications director Amy Mast&lt;/a&gt;, says customers will be able to use an “online fleet configurator to plan and place your fleet order” in “early 2022,” and that “[d]eliveries of the [van] are scheduled to begin in early 2023.” Mast declined to comment, citing the SEC’s mandatory quiet period in the run-up to a public offering. Amazon also declined to comment when asked about the status of the exclusivity period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNaZjl"&gt;There are a few provisions in the agreement with Amazon that could void the exclusivity period, though they don’t seem applicable yet. If Amazon doesn’t order 10,000 of Rivian’s vans in each of the two years after they go into production, it would have to reimburse the startup for certain costs and the exclusivity period would be voided. Same goes if Amazon terminates its agreement with Rivian before ordering all 100,000 vans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2pNvh"&gt;Rivian still touts the deal with Amazon on the new fleet page, too. “To meet the demands of the largest retail seller in the United States, Rivian created vehicles and infrastructures to increase safety and efficiency while improving total cost of ownership,” the company writes. “Rivian plans to deliver 100,000 Electric Delivery Vans to Amazon to help Amazon take a significant step toward achieving its ambitious goals for the planet.” The startup confirms it still plans to deliver the first 10 delivery vans to Amazon by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QCCH6"&gt;There could be a semantic explanation for all of this. Rivian and Amazon’s exclusive agreement is in reference to “last mile delivery vehicles,” which the companies obtusely define as “any electric vehicles and other delivery carriers and systems designed or produced for use in a fleet for logistics or last mile transportation of goods to the final delivery destination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvxtoo"&gt;Rivian’s new fleet site, however, refers to the van more broadly as a “commercial vehicle.” So it may be that Rivian is starting to detail efforts to sell vans to companies that aren’t in the delivery business, and that the exclusivity is more about keeping Rivian’s vans away from Amazon’s direct competition. (Though, FedEx has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;working with General Motors’ commercial EV effort&lt;/a&gt;, BrightDrop, and &lt;a href="https://arrival.com/us/en/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles"&gt;UPS invested in Arrival&lt;/a&gt;.) Whatever is happening, it appears that Rivian’s deal with Amazon is not as prohibitive as it initially seemed — and something the company will likely share more about after it goes public this week.&lt;/p&gt;
