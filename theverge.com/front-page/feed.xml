    <title>EV charging network ChargePoint now supports Android Auto  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Q4crVHGD5kpCNXPN0D7ZvbmWmU=/162x0:1356x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203865/Android_Auto_Screens_Nearby_Stations.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The integration lets you view charging stations directly from your car’s infotainment screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ChargePoint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qdPP52"&gt;ChargePoint, operator of one of the largest EV charging networks across Europe and North America, is adding support for Android Auto to its app. The functionality means Android phone users will be able to find, navigate to, and start charging from a ChargePoint charging station from their car’s infotainment screen, without having to pick up their phone. Support for Android Auto follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571093/chargepoint-carplay-app-find-stations-start-charging-electric-cars-ev"&gt;addition of CarPlay support&lt;/a&gt; in November last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmRTb5"&gt;According to ChargePoint, the Android Auto experience lets you view a map with nearby charging stations, check status, filter by metrics like availability and cost, and then start a charging session once you arrive. The in-vehicle app can also be set to notify the driver once a busy charging station becomes available. ChargePoint says its network includes over one hundred thousand charging locations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6xLSMCUX-Nq3_bP97XfP6xsMJ9Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477688/Android_Auto_Screens_Station_Details.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ChargePoint&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Details about available charging spots can be viewed from the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zadkv0"&gt;The app’s Android Auto support will be available from today in the USA, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. To use it, you’ll need ChargePoint’s app running on a device with Android 6.0 or above, and a car that supports Android Auto. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung loses over $270M from Texas plant shutdown as quarterly profits boom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AHjlqNP9zskqnOU3qbEefZHi4io=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203726/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rjroCK"&gt;Shutting down its semiconductor plant in Austin, Texas lost Samsung over 300 billion won (around $270 million), &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210429007100320"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yonhap News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking during a conference call, a senior vice president at Samsung’s foundry business Han Seung-hoon said that the shutdown affected around 71,000 wafers, corresponding to “around 300 to 400 billion won in damage.” The statement coincided with Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2021-results?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=direct"&gt;latest earnings release&lt;/a&gt;, in which it reported strong sales of its smartphones and other consumer electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUpzfR"&gt;The South Korean electronics giant was forced to shut down its Austin plant — which produces microprocessors like radio frequency integrated circuits and solid state drive controllers — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287054/samsung-chip-production-halted-austin-winter-storm-uri-power-blackouts"&gt;back in February&lt;/a&gt; after a storm left some 200,000 Austin homes without power. The shutdown lasted a month in total, the longest Samsung has ever had to halt production at a factory. However, the company says that the plant was back up to 90 percent production at the end of March, and is now back up to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GHRsrA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Around 71,000 wafers were affected by the Austin plant shutdown&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E1SnbY"&gt;Overall, however, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b7b284a-a280-4252-bcc7-0fb6a4ef5d92"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Samsung profits exceeded expectations. Net profit for the quarter was up 46 percent to 7.1 trillion won (around $6.4 billion) compared to the same quarter the previous year, resulting in its highest first quarter profit since 2018.  The increase was driven by a 66 percent surge in profits at its mobile division, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/samsung-earnings-q1-2021.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung says that sales of its “well received” flagship Galaxy S21 series have increased alongside its more price competitive midrange models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thBH4R"&gt;Samsung’s own manufacturing issues have coincided with a global chip shortage that’s affected everything from graphics cards to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;even toasters&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung says the supply issues have had knock-on effects on its business, contributing to a drop in sales for mobile displays in the first quarter. The company says it’s possible that supply issues will continue into the second half of the year (echoing similar predictions from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC and Intel&lt;/a&gt;), but that it’s “strengthening cooperation with the in-house foundry and expanding the use of outsourced foundries” to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9Acn7"&gt;Otherwise, Samsung thinks its business will benefit from economic recoveries and stimulus programs around the world. It expects strong demand for everything from servers, to storage, smartphones, and PCs in the second half of the year. However, it specifically says that demand for TVs could drop in the same period, as people start venturing outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kd9se"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSheaR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon lawsuit alleging Trump bias in $10 billion military contract clears another hurdle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqnP71Iezoxz1ysOg1aOo6r6_8Q=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203696/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0LeMrI"&gt;An ongoing lawsuit pursued by Amazon against the US government and Microsoft will continue after a federal judge rejected a motion to dismiss the case. The suit concerns Microsoft’s success in securing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20700698/microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-cloud-amazon-details"&gt;$10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract&lt;/a&gt; with the Defense Department — a decision that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002725/amazon-trump-jedi-contract-rules-court-documents-microsoft-pentagon"&gt;Amazon says&lt;/a&gt; was influenced by President Donald Trump’s dislike of the company and its CEO Jeff Bezos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gtKOz"&gt;The decision, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/28/pentagon-cloud-contract-depositions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-28/judge-declines-to-toss-amazon-suit-claiming-trump-cost-jedi-bid"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;means Amazon can now argue in front of a court that Trump himself and former defense secretary Jim Mattis should testify. A motion to dismiss the case was rejected by Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith on Wednesday April 28, though her full opinion was filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JiZYRN"&gt;Amazon and Microsoft are both industry leaders in the cloud computing market, but Amazon was seen as having the edge over its rival in securing the JEDI contract. When Microsoft was announced as the winner in October 2019, Amazon quickly objected, accusing President Trump of putting pressure on the government to pick Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDjvacxzRnNcogXH8k6irT4XK-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22477655/Screen_Shot_2021_04_29_at_9.58.17_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;President Trump shakes hands with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in 2017 as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos looks on. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ibV0v7"&gt;There’s ample evidence of Trump’s dislike of both Amazon and Bezos, especially after Bezos’ purchase of &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, which Trump claimed pursued a political agenda against him in its reporting. Evidence of Trump’s influence includes &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/26/trump-mattis-screw-amazon-10-billion-pentagon-cloud-contract-jedi.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that he directly told Mattis to “screw Amazon” out of the $10 billion contract. (Mattis reportedly responded: “We’re not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VR0LT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This procedural ruling changes little.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZm4uj"&gt;Responding to the news, Microsoft said it would make no difference. “This procedural ruling changes little. Not once, but twice, professional procurement staff at the DoD chose Microsoft after a thorough review,” said Microsoft’s communications head Frank Shaw in a statement. “Many other large and sophisticated customers make the same choice every week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGwx3Z"&gt;Amazon applauded the decision, with Drew Herdener, vice president of communications, noting that there was a “disturbing” record of Trump improperly wielding his influence. “We continue to look forward to the Court’s review of the many material flaws in the DoD’s evaluation, and we remain absolutely committed to ensuring that the Department has access to the best technology at the best price,” wrote Herdener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrQ33S"&gt;Although the case is a long way from being settled, it’s possible that the mere threat of a drawn-out court battle will change the outcome. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/01/pentagon-hints-it-could-abandon-jedi-cloud-effort/171753/"&gt;memo from January&lt;/a&gt;, the Defense Department hinted as much. “The prospect of such a lengthy litigation process might bring the future of the JEDI Cloud procurement into question,” said the department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I46LvD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 preorders begin in China, almost six months after US launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnhaWK6qxoYpECskCxyWXOgVl_I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203624/vpavic_4278_20201030_0247.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KNi2lA"&gt;The PS5 will be available to buy in China on May 15th, a little over six months after its original release in the US last year, &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/2833736934/Kd7K32XBZ?from=page_1006062833736934_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment#_rnd1619682582948"&gt;Sony announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The disc version of the console will retail for 3,899 yuan (around $600), while the cheaper disc-free model will cost 3,099 yuan (around $479). Preorders open today. The launch means Sony’s next-gen console will beat Microsoft’s to release in the country, although &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/sony-playstation-5-launch-china-ahead-of-microsofts-xbox.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBNC&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft received safety approvals to release the Xbox Series X and Series S there at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjo3zc"&gt;Relative to its size and population, China isn’t considered a huge market for console gaming. Game consoles were technically illegal in the country &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/china-lifts-13-year-ban-video-games-consoles"&gt;until 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which meant PC and mobile gaming has become dominant. Even now, strict laws make it hard to release consoles in China simultaneously with other countries. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/11/7376315/Sony-ps4-joins-microsoft-xbox-one-in-china"&gt;PS4, Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20994756/nintendo-switch-china-launch-release-date-price-tencent"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt; have all released in China, with Nintendo’s console reportedly being the most successful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNe3IX"&gt;The PS5’s Chinese launch comes as the console faces stock issues around the world. A combination of unexpectedly high demand as well as supply chain issues including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;, have been blamed for the problems. However, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan recently said he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;expects the stock situation to improve&lt;/a&gt; in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vivaldi is updating its browsers to block annoying cookie pop-ups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i60nfBJtsFfk2phO_qZj3fvHdpc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203592/vivaldi_browser_cookie_blocker_setting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WTD3D"&gt;Vivaldi announced today that it’s updating the &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/vivaldi-browser-blocks-cookie-dialogs-improves-privacy-design/"&gt;desktop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/embargoed/new-vivaldi-on-android-language-switcher-cookie-crumbler/"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; versions of its Vivaldi browser with the ability to block annoying cookie preference pop-ups. Thanks to the passage of the European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; (GDPR), you’ve probably had to click through at least one dialog box asking if you’d like to manage how a site tracks you. Vivaldi’s new update lets you avoid those notifications — with some major caveats — while theoretically still keeping you safe from tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EJa8q"&gt;Vivaldi’s logic for the new feature, affectionately called “Cookie Crumbler,” is that while giving users control over how they’re tracked is good, doing so through a pop-up “leads to clicking ‘allow’ or ‘accept’ without realizing that unwittingly users just gave permission for trackers to create behavioral profiles about them,” Vivaldi writes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-v1z0djtC6kORkl4FMj0ezKL-UY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476438/Screen_Shot_2021_04_28_at_1.05.47_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A cookie dialog box from &lt;/em&gt;The Guardian.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYhPRA"&gt;Vivaldi’s &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/ad-blocker/"&gt;built-in Ad Blocker&lt;/a&gt; can theoretically already handle hiding users from the various tracking methods deployed by sites, so Cookie Crumbler is about removing the annoying hangers-on — the pop-up notifications that direct users to customize how they’re tracked, if at all. Users with an updated version of Vivaldi (version 3.8 as of today) can enable Cookie Crumbler by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracker and ad blocking &amp;gt; Manage sources &amp;gt; Remove cookie warnings lists. The same feature can be enabled on the Android version of Vivaldi under the same menus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4CzAkfZA18MElQRuM7398cB-mTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476434/vivaldi_browser_cookie_blocker_setting_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Cookie Crumbler” can be enabled on Android in the same menu you manage Vivaldi’s ad and tracker blocker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LoBREU"&gt;Cookie Crumbler pulls from two separate third-party block lists to work, but “this is not a perfect solution, as there will be a few websites that use other tactics to obtain cookie consent,” Vivaldi says. Enabling Cookie Crumbler may also make some sites completely inaccessible on desktop and mobile, depending on if the site locks some functionality behind interacting with the cookie dialog. Losing access to some websites is a major inconvenience for a web browser that’s designed to visit websites, and that may be why Cookie Crumbler isn’t enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzHsYa"&gt;Vivaldi is also taking an even stronger stance on Google’s cookie alternative, FLoC, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/a&gt;. FLoC builds cohorts from users’ browsing history to sort them semi-anonymously by interests or qualities for websites looking to sell ads. It seems less directly invasive than a traditional cookie, but also hugely dependent on browser makers implementing it correctly for it to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyVYpP"&gt;Vivaldi is &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/no-google-vivaldi-users-will-not-get-floced/"&gt;decidedly not okay&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s implementation of FLoC and is not enabling it in its browser, despite relying on Google’s Chromium codebase. With today’s updated version of Vivaldi, it’s also blacklisting the FLoC component required for Google’s current test of the ad technology, removing it from browsers that might already have it downloaded and preventing it from being downloaded going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXff93"&gt;Vivaldi 3.8 also adds new customization options for the browser’s Panels feature (think SlideOver in iPadOS but for websites) and a new keyboard command for adding bookmarks. The Android version of the app can also now switch between the 41 languages Vivaldi supports rather than relying on Android’s built-in language settings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Would you pay $30 a month for a faster web browser that eats less battery?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LENmsQirMZcz7iocpzQn4960BIg=/0x0:1376x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69203413/mighty_browser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ao3iRA"&gt;No matter how much web browsers improve, it feels like they can’t keep pace with everything we want to do. Open one too many tabs on a few-year-old laptop, and your fan starts spinning, your battery life dips, your system starts to slow. A faster or cleaner PC might fix it, but &lt;a href="https://www.mightyapp.com/"&gt;a startup called Mighty has a different idea&lt;/a&gt;: a $30-a-month web browser that lives in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ievKTm"&gt;Instead of your own physical computer interacting with each website, you stream a&lt;em&gt; remote &lt;/em&gt;web browser instead, one that lives on a powerful computer many miles away with its own 1,000Mbps connection to the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAtGyB"&gt;Suddenly, your decent internet connection would feel like one of the fastest internet connections in the world, with websites loading nigh-instantly and intensive web apps running smoothly without monopolizing your RAM, CPU, GPU and battery, no matter how many tabs you’ve got open — because the only thing &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; computer is doing is effectively streaming a video of that remote computer (much like Netflix, YouTube, Google Stadia, etc.)  while sending your keyboard and mouse commands to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z2VD1m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWPdDgSZ5yU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMeA3R"&gt;Skeptical? I definitely am, but perhaps not for the reason you’d think — because I tried this exact idea nearly a decade ago, and it absolutely works in practice. In 2012, cloud gaming pioneer OnLive introduced a virtual desktop web browser that would let you load full websites on an iPad in the blink of an eye &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; stream 4K video from YouTube. (Quite the feat in 2012!) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/22/2817646/onlive-desktop-plus-has-the-fastest-virtual-web-browser-youve-ever"&gt;I called it the fastest web browser you’ve ever used&lt;/a&gt;, and OnLive’s asking price was just $5 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E6HE8w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a proven idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2fXRx"&gt;Cloud desktop providers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176310/shadow-cloud-gaming-service-price-lower-google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now"&gt;like Shadow&lt;/a&gt; have also offered similar capabilities; when you rent their gaming-PCs-in-the-cloud ($12-15 a month), you can use those virtual PCs’ built-in web browsers to get similar speeds, thanks to the fact they typically live in data centers with very few hops to (and possibly direct peering arrangements with) major content delivery networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76CLaI"&gt;Mighty argues that by focusing on the browser (rather than recreating a whole Windows PC), it can give more people what they actually want. “Most people want an experience where the underlying OS and the application (the browser) interoperate seamlessly versus having to tame two desktop experiences,” &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26962818"&gt;founder Suhail Doshi commented at&lt;em&gt; Hacker News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mighty claims it’ll eliminate distracting cookies and ads, automatically notify you about Zoom meetings, quick search Google Docs and presumably other integrations to come. Mighty also says it encrypts your data and keystrokes, &lt;a href="https://www.mightyapp.com/security"&gt;among other security promises.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9nNZv"&gt;But it’s not entirely clear why it costs so much more, or who would be willing to pay $30 a month for such a subscription — you’d think the kinds of people who can afford a monthly browser bill on top of their monthly internet bill would be the same kinds of people who can afford a faster PC and faster internet to begin with. Gigabit fiber is already a reality for some homes, and it’s not like Mighty will turn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;your iffy 25/3 connection&lt;/a&gt; into a gigabit one; while Doshi tells me it’ll technically work with a 20Mbps connection, he says he’s targeting 80+Mbps households right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If2683"&gt;Then again, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;it’s not like everyone has a real choice of internet service provider&lt;/a&gt;, no matter how much money they make. As Jürgen Geuter (aka tante) points out below, this feels more like an indictment than innovation. It’s been a decade, and we still haven’t solved these problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qKjRkW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Streaming your browser to you because rendering the HTML is too slow on your machine" is not innovation but a mark of shame on everyone building websites and browsers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tech failed as an industry. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JJC0WomArb"&gt;https://t.co/JJC0WomArb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tante (@tante) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tante/status/1387390816595947522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YIMvM9"&gt;I agree &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1387499682759380995"&gt;with my colleague Tom&lt;/a&gt;: I genuinely want to know who’d actually pay for this and why. Would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HQzqfI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I want to meet whoever is going to spend $30 a month to stream a Chromium browser from the cloud just to avoid RAM hungry Chrome &lt;a href="https://t.co/4pl6jL2zUV"&gt;https://t.co/4pl6jL2zUV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1387499682759380995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Facebook claims it mistakenly hid posts calling for India’s prime minister to resign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NejP3qeOZaAQUaLrvkqiS_3MN7c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201908/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kLTZoh"&gt;When Facebook users tried to view a hashtag calling for the resignation of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srinivasaiims/status/1387472195316711426"&gt;instead saw a message&lt;/a&gt; saying that Facebook was temporarily hiding the posts in order to keep the community safe. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-blocking-posts-hashtag-resign-modi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the posts were hidden for about three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3qohU"&gt;Facebook has now restored the posts. The company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hashtag was blocked “by mistake” and claims it wasn’t because the Indian government asked Facebook to remove it. It also says the block was the result of some of the content that used the hashtag, but did not specify what kind of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeLMIH"&gt;The temporary suspension of the hashtag is likely to fuel concerns about the influence that Modi’s BJP party wields over Facebook operations and social media in general. Last weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter hid tweets critical of various officials&lt;/a&gt; after receiving an emergency order from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foSR7N"&gt;India is currently currently seeing another wave in COVID-19 cases, which has lead to critical medical supplies being in short supply. Many of the Facebook posts with the ResignModi hashtag include references to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2MMbby"&gt;Facebook has blocked hashtags in the past — during the 2020 US election &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551717/facebook-tiktok-block-election-conspiracy-theory-hashtags-twitter-monitoring"&gt;it blocked the  “StopTheSteal” tag&lt;/a&gt;, showing users a similar message to the one seen in India today. The hashtag for “Qanon” is also blocked, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504887/facebook-qanon-ban-all-apps-pages-groups-instagram-accounts"&gt;part of Facebook’s fight&lt;/a&gt; against the conspiracy-based social movement. Unlike the ResignModi hashtag, the StopTheSteal and Qanon tags are still blocked, with the message citing content that goes against community standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqaH8A"&gt;Facebook India has been a sore point for the company in recent months, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536149/ankhi-das-facebook-india-resigned-quit-bjp-hindu-muslim-conflict"&gt;controversial policy chief resigning&lt;/a&gt; last October. Critics pressured her to leave, claiming that, under her guidance, Facebook India had failed to moderate hate speech that led to anti-Muslim pogroms in Delhi. More broadly, there were concerns that her public alignment with the ruling BJP party had led to unfair application of Facebook policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="162nQO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 28th, 9:04PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s pay raise for over 500,000 workers comes at an interesting time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTm_XxvVt3EXSYcqwX81Bd4F8hY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202415/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFHMtK"&gt;Amazon has announced that over 500,000 of its workers will get a permanent increase in their hourly wages starting in mid-May, from as low as an additional 50 cents an hour to as much as three extra dollars per hour (via &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-boost-pay-500k-operations-workers-much-3-hour-1b-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeekWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s a substantial chunk of its 1.3 million person workforce getting at least a small pay bump, and the company shared that it’s investing over $1 billion in these pay increases. Amazon said that it’s also on a hiring spree for “tens of thousands of jobs across our operations in the US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xGE3T"&gt;Amazon previously recognized its warehouse and delivery workers with a $2 pay bump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182411/amazon-hires-employees-warehouse-delivery-pay-raise-coronavirus"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt; as the company worked to meet increased demand during the pandemic, but that was a temporary raise that disappeared &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/amazon-to-end-wage-increases-and-overtime-pay-in-june.html"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the United States had reached 100,000 deaths; the coronavirus pandemic has killed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/us/us-covid-deaths-half-a-million.html"&gt;over 400,000 additional people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States since then. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the pay bumps announced Wednesday are permanent, however, and new hires will be eligible for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m66m6c"&gt;Here’s the full text of &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/a-message-from-darcie-henry-amazon-vp-of-people-experience-and-technology-worldwide-consumer"&gt;Amazon’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, from Amazon’s Darcie Henry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="virJLb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon is hiring now for tens of thousands of jobs across our operations in the U.S., and we’re looking for great people to join our Customer Fulfillment, Delivery, Package Sortation, and Specialty Fulfillment teams. In support of this effort, we pulled forward our annual fall pay review for these teams and will be rolling out increases from mid-May through early June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loy9S5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than 500,000 people will see an increase between at least 50 cents and $3 an hour, which is an investment of over $1 billion in incremental pay for these employees. This is on top of our already industry-leading starting wage of at least $15 an hour and the more than $2.5 billion that we invested last year in additional bonuses and incentives for front-line teams. These jobs come with a range of great benefits, like medical, dental, and vision coverage, parental leave, ways to save for the future, and opportunities for career advancement—all in a safe and inclusive environment that’s been ranked among the best workplaces in the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXlFzG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other teams are continuing with their regular annual compensation review plans, which will occur throughout the remainder of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hYQ2LI"&gt;Wednesday’s news comes just a day before the company’s earnings tomorrow, April 29th. It also arrives as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;a fired Amazon worker is attempting to unionize other warehouse employees&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"&gt;the failed union vote in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is giving its top prepaid hotspot plan a big price cut and more data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F6nYNSjSefgz4FUmbf23KKjuw7g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69202232/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers already enrolled in the prepaid plan will get a data boost and a lower price when their plan renews.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XCXn6a"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says it will now offer a prepaid 5G data-only plan with up to 100GB of data for $55 per month — a big upgrade from its previous offering of 40GB for $75. The new pricing extends to Cricket Wireless customers as well as AT&amp;amp;T’s direct prepaid subscribers, though those on Cricket won’t be able to access the 5G network. These plans allow customers to buy data for their tablet or mobile hotspot separate from their voice plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnrf2"&gt;That 100GB is a lot of data at a lower price than the other major carriers are offering; currently, T-Mobile has a prepaid data-only plan of 50GB for $50 and Verizon has a 30GB plan for $65 per month. It may be no coincidence that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497743/verizon-home-lte-service-rural-communities-48-states"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22312155/t-mobile-5g-home-internet-wireless-broadband"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; are also eager to expand their own 5G and LTE-based fixed home wireless products, but AT&amp;amp;T may have a little more room to be aggressive with its mobile hotspot offerings while it remains committed to pushing its fiber home internet service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWxMmR"&gt;The company says that current Cricket customers already enrolled in the 100GB data-only plan — previously $90 per month — will see the new price reflected on their next bill. Likewise, existing AT&amp;amp;T customers will get a data bump and a price decrease automatically. New customers can sign up for the plans starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Space community mourns the death of Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Michael Collins Studying Flight Plans" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GkE4stmIsKUKEK68OdCmV0i5Q1g=/0x20:3989x2679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69201988/517427560.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kuQOSQ"&gt;Michael Collins, the witty “forgotten” astronaut of NASA’s legendary Apollo 11 mission to the Moon, died of cancer on Wednesday, his family said. An icon of space exploration and an eloquent storyteller (who, arguably, had the best sense of humor among the Apollo 11 crew), Collins passionately advocated for further exploration of other worlds. Astronauts, NASA officials, and others in the space community who are heeding his advocacy mourned his death today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKtfx9"&gt;Collins was the Columbia command module pilot who stayed in orbit around the Moon in 1969 while his crew mates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, descended to the lunar surface and became the first two humans to set foot on another world. Aldrin, now the only living Apollo 11 astronaut, mourned his fellow crewmate in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NreQh8"&gt;“Dear Mike,” Aldrin said, “Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future. We will miss you. May you Rest In Peace. #Apollo11”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="okhfg7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Dear Mike,&lt;br&gt;Wherever you have been or will be, you will always have the Fire to Carry us deftly to new heights and to the future.  We will miss you. May you Rest In Peace.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apollo11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apollo11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q4sJjFdvf8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q4sJjFdvf8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Buzz Aldrin (@TheRealBuzz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/1387451395461292037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPjUPI"&gt;After the Apollo 11 mission, Collins was given an informal nickname, the “forgotten astronaut,” and went on to write several books, including a 1974 memoir, &lt;em&gt;Carrying the Fire&lt;/em&gt;, where&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;he relived the feeling of utter loneliness as his Columbia module flew into the remote darkness of the Moon’s far side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvKM5o"&gt;“I like the feeling,” he wrote in his memoir. “Outside my window I can see stars — and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void.” He called his perch in the capsule his “beautiful little domain” in a 2019 interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, adding “It was all mine. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7J2MvI"&gt;Collins had a long career, even beyond NASA. During his 90 years on (and off) Earth, he also served as an Air Force colonel, head of the State Department’s public affairs bureau, and director of the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. “He helped shepherd the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum from a rickety old hut on the National Mall to its present premises,” said Tom Ellis, a teaching fellow at the London School of Economics who studies space history. His stint as the museum’s director, Ellis said, “demonstrated that he was a rare spacefarer who truly understood just how ‘historic’ the space age was. Someone whose post-space career was as impressive as his time as an astronaut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We mourn the passing and celebrate the life of our former director and astronaut Michael Collins. His vision and extraordinary achievements helped define our museum, and his wit, warmth, and wisdom will always be a part of our work. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z8VPRSfabs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z8VPRSfabs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— National Air and Space Museum (@airandspace) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/airandspace/status/1387453338363568129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZWGVC"&gt;NASA’s acting administrator Steve Jurczyk said Collins was “a friend of all who seek to push the envelope of human potential,” citing a famous quote from the astronaut: “Exploration is not a choice, really, it’s an imperative.” Jurczyk added: “Whether his work was behind the scenes or on full view, his legacy will always be as one of the leaders who took America’s first steps into the cosmos. And his spirit will go with us as we venture toward farther horizons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktFgnR"&gt;NASA is investing billions into its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon and establish a long-term presence that can inform future missions to Mars. The space agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a $2.9 billion contract with SpaceX this month to deliver the first crew of astronauts to the lunar surface since the last Apollo Moon mission in 1972. Past attempts to build on the Apollo program’s legacy and return to the Moon were squashed by shifting presidential priorities — but the Artemis program, started in 2019 by the Trump administration, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;won embrace&lt;/a&gt; by the Biden administration as well, making a crewed return more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HfvpOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We will continue Carrying the Fire, Mike.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVrMw0"&gt;Pam Melroy, a retired NASA astronaut of three shuttle missions and President Biden’s nominee for NASA Deputy Administrator, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Astro_Pam/status/1387457744224014341?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “So, so sad at the passing of my favorite astronaut, @AstroMCollins. A hero just outside the spotlight. We will continue Carrying the Fire, Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PJhIB"&gt;Mark Geyer, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, NASA’s astronaut HQ, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DirectorMarkG/status/1387475108004962304?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “many people here at JSC will remember his wit, humor, and their interactions with him with both admiration and affection.” Geyer recalled Collins’ visit to JSC in 2019, during the 50th Apollo 11 anniversary: “Mike said he primarily remembers not having time to relax and enjoy the view for long, but in the moments when he did he look out his window at Earth, he realized how delicate it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqWuxT"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-passing-of-michael-collins/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, President Biden said Collins “lived a life of service to our country” who “both wrote and helped tell the story of our nation’s remarkable accomplishments in space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePnvLc"&gt;“From his vantage point high above the Earth, he reminded us of the fragility of our own planet, and called on us to care for it like the treasure it is,” Biden said. “Our prayers are with General Collins’ family. Godspeed, Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;
