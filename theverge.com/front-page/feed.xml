    <title>Google announces health tool to identify skin conditions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cartoon image of a person using a smartphone to photograph a rash on their hand." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Z4Vkr4CXtSJXjODsaYEL1sDYH8=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306833/Copy_of_derm___hero_image_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google developed a tool to help people identify skin conditions.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="maDmL0"&gt;Google’s latest foray into health care is a web tool that uses artificial intelligence to help people identify skin, hair, or nail conditions. The company previewed the tool at I/O today, and it says it hopes to launch a pilot later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3c2bq7"&gt;People can use their phone’s camera to take three pictures of the problem area — for example, a rash on their arm. They’ll then answer a series of questions about their skin type and other symptoms. The tool then gives a list of possible conditions from a set of 288 that it’s trained to recognize. It’s not intended to diagnose the problem, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/530ZzjZDimv-GMJ7SdULjDFNRJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521171/Copy_of_01_derm_summary.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google tool asks people to take three photos of a skin problem, and then it offers possible conditions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiMGjX"&gt;Google decided to tackle skin conditions using artificial intelligence because of their prevalence, says Karen DeSalvo, the chief health officer at Google Health. “People are coming to Google to ask questions about skin conditions. We get about 10 billion annual skin condition queries,” she said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, experts can help people determine if it’s something simple or indicative of a more serious illness, but there’s a shortage of dermatologists all over the world. DeSalvo hopes this tool can help get people accurate information about potential conditions, quickly, without having to spend hours doing their own online research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z34oxw"&gt;The team trained the model on millions of images of skin problems, thousands of images of healthy skin, and 65,000 images from clinical settings. The model takes factors like age, skin type, sex, and race into account when suggesting possible conditions. When it was tested on around 1,000 images of skin problems from a diverse range of patients, Google says it identified the correct condition in the top three suggestions 84 percent of the time. It included the correct condition as one of the possible issues 97 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="horSJJ"&gt;The new system builds on Google’s past work using artificial intelligence tools to identify skin conditions. The company published the first iteration of its deep learning system in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last spring. That paper showed that the system could identify 26 common skin conditions just as accurately as dermatologists and more accurately than primary care doctors. In April, the company published &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2779250"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; showing that the system could help non-dermatologist physicians diagnose skin conditions more accurately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvaVHD"&gt;Google is also working with a Stanford University research team to test how well the tool works in a health care setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeP573"&gt;The company obtained a Class I medical device mark for the tool in the European Union, designating it as a low-risk medical device. It has not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xwx3ma"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22200447"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google I/O 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lZoJv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imfVFi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

There is also a sale on the 256GB, which is available for $490 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NHN9W4J?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQeiGK"&gt;Walmart, however, offers an even steeper discount; the 64GB iPad mini is currently available for $369 in either &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F816033343%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $540, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594487-REG%2Fapple_myfq2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; currently have the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors for $559. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has been discounted in every color minus space gray at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $670, which is nearly $80 off its usual price of $749. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeiPadDeals032921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is also having a sale&lt;/a&gt; on the iPad Air 256GB, offering it for as low as $699.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-gen, M1-equipped iPad Pro is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394227/apple-ipad-pro-2021-how-where-to-buy-preorder-link"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt;, which means there are plenty of deals to be had on the now-discontinued 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro. The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch, fourth-gen model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos will soon make animated photos from your still shots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp16hmVQgmcDQDpItu3ksgkeWPI=/10x0:741x487/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306801/cinematic.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UNgPGB"&gt;Google Photos will soon have a cool new trick: if you take two similar images with your phone’s camera, the app will be able to create an animated, moving shot that combines them. It does this by using machine learning to synthesize movement between the two shots. Google creates new frames between them, resulting in a “vivid moving picture.”  Google’s Shimrit Ben-Yair made this sound like something that parents will love since now your multiple attempts at the same shot will allow for this added benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLujub"&gt;The new feature is called “cinematic moments,” and it will work on both Android and iOS, Ben-Yair said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sm2iCe"&gt;Google also announced a new locked folder feature that will let you hide your most sensitive images behind a folder protected by a password or thumbprint. The app will also soon let you hide specific people or periods of your life from its “memories” to avoid unwanted reminders of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxBqek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22200447"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google I/O 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps’ Live View feature now offers more useful information about restaurants and businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4Tkp51qIlGC-cKPEyQCRdYMIHY=/0x28:898x627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306773/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_7.29.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iPntOY"&gt;Google announced a bunch of new features for Google Maps at its 2021 I/O developer conference today, including upgrades to its handy Live View tool, which helps you navigate the world through augmented reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm3cN1"&gt;Live View launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776247/google-maps-live-view-ar-walking-directions-ios-android-feature"&gt;in beta in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, projecting walking directions through your camera’s viewfinder, and was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22357528/google-maps-directions-indoor-ar-live-view-fuel-efficient-weather-air-quality-layer"&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; to airports, transit stations, and malls earlier this year. Now, Live View will be accessible directly from Google Maps and will collate a lot of handy information, including how busy shops and restaurants are, recent reviews, and any uploaded photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfeyyD"&gt;It sounds particularly handy for exploring new destinations remotely. You can remotely browse that street full of interesting restaurants while on holiday, checking out which places are heaving, and even looking at some of the pictures of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EV7KB6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re making it easier to explore with Live View.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon you’ll be able to access it right from the map to see helpful details about places nearby — like their busyness, reviews, photos, and more. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/V2g5Q8s7rR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/V2g5Q8s7rR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Maps (@googlemaps) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps/status/1394714911524130827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue62Yw"&gt;Live View also now has better labeling for streets on complex intersections, says Google, and it will automatically orient you in relation to known locations (like your home or work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yh8sy"&gt;That’s not all for Maps, though, and as Google’s Liz Reid said onstage, the company is on track to launch “more than 100 AI-driven improvements” for the app this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oyktpU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 preview: first look at Google’s radical new design","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1ajm1K"&gt;Other upgrades include a wider launch for the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/more-detailed-colorful-map"&gt;detailed street map view&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available in 50 new cities by the end of the year, including Berlin, São Paulo, Seattle, and Singapore; new “busyness” indicators for whole areas as opposed to specific shops and businesses; and selective highlighting of nearby businesses based on the time of day that you’re looking at Google Maps. So if you open up the app first thing in the morning, it’ll show you more places to grab a coffee than a candle-lit dinner for two. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilDKYfJ3h1RvQc64R6-kO4oYHKo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523422/google_detailed_street_map.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of Google Maps’ before and after its more detailed street map view. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSaGxH"&gt;A more ambitious upgrade for Maps is using AI to identify and forecast “hard-braking events” when you’re in your car. Think of it like traffic warnings that navigation apps issue based on data collated from multiple users. But instead of just traffic jams, Google Maps will try to identify harder-to-define “situations that cause you to slam on the brakes, such as confusing lane changes or freeway exits.” The company says its tech has the ability to “eliminate over 100 million hard-braking events in routes driven with Google Maps each year” by giving users a head’s up when it knows such an event is on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and Samsung are merging Wear OS and Tizen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2VWokG1sm_YF2ke2sC8EVH4ZT4=/127x0:1450x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306763/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvSfFa"&gt;In yet another sign of the growing alliance between Google and Samsung, today both companies announced that they are essentially combining Wear OS — Google’s operating system — and the Tizen-based software platform that has been foundational to Samsung’s wearables for many years. The resulting platform will now be known simply as “Wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jmkE"&gt;Benefits of the joint effort include significant improvements to battery life, 30 percent faster loading times for apps, and smoother animations. It also simplifies life for developers and will create one central smartwatch OS for the Android platform. Google is also promising a greater selection of apps and watch faces than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RFkSoy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re combining the best of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WearOSbyGoogle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@wearosbygoogle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SamsungMobile&lt;/a&gt; Tizen into a unified wearable platform. ⌚ Apps will start faster, battery life will be longer and you'll have more choice than ever before, from devices to apps and watch faces. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vj2aYZD81x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vj2aYZD81x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1394722430212616192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DDhsFY"&gt;“All device makers will be able to add a customized user experience on top of the platform, and developers will be able to use the Android tools they already know and love to build for one platform and ecosystem,” Google’s Bjorn Kilburn &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/wear-io21/"&gt;wrote in a blog post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vN3K0uI3u8-qgSiKxMsFHN-xjJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523508/Tiles.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wear will make it easier to multitask across smartwatch widgets and apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndQZOs"&gt;Samsung confirmed that its next Galaxy Watch will run on this unified platform. And future Fitbit devices will also run the software. Aside from merging the technologies of both platforms, the new Wear OS will include improvements that make it easier to multitask between wrist apps. And some of Fitbit’s “most popular” fitness tracking features will also be included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKC0kK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22200447"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google I/O 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will turn your Pixel phone into a car key — assuming automakers bother</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnT-8uKxr368N6I_WFIh_JRGzTE=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306754/bmw_ix.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BMW iX, which will support seamless unlocks with UWB tech. | Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gfRrmI"&gt;Nearly a year after Apple announced the iPhone would become your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;digital car key&lt;/a&gt;, Google is doing the same. Android 12 will officially let “select Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones” natively double as a car key later this year, the company just announced at its Google I/O 2021 developer conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8bE0y"&gt;It’s not like Google is exactly late to the party, though, because automakers are taking their sweet time rolling out the technology, too. In fact, Google’s announcement only names a single brand — BMW — which already announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;it would work with Samsung&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. And last we checked, BMW has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;only committed a single car&lt;/a&gt; to support the seemingly “best” version of the digital car key technology. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hpf7_aHdcc9pnH3IKPpoFxC46ZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522292/android_12_digital_car_key.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RvjQUu"&gt;The end goal here is to replace your bulky key fob — which already lets you enter a car without removing it from your pocket — with your phone instead, using new ultra-wideband (UWB) radios to securely tell your car you’re actually standing right in front of it. Apple’s quietly slipped those radios into (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222731/apple-iphone-se-u1-locator-chip-wifi-6-express-cards"&gt;almost&lt;/a&gt;) all of its new iPhones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;and its latest Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, and presumably today’s announcement means the next Google Pixel will have them as well. (They could also let you locate your car in a crowded parking lot, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;something Samsung plans to take advantage of&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzhoJG"&gt;But... whether for backwards compatibility’s sake or because they’re pinching pennies, both Google’s and Apple’s technology also supports near-field communication (NFC), which requires you to physically pull your phone out of your pocket and tap it to a car like the 2021 BMW 5 Series. In some ways, that’s actually a step backward from the humble radio key fob.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dIVKkl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmX42g"&gt;Now, BMW likely isn’t the only automaker interested in the potential of UWB: Hyundai, at least, &lt;a href="https://www.firaconsortium.org/about/members"&gt;is a member of the FiRa Consortium&lt;/a&gt; that’s pushing for UWB specifically, and both Hyundai and Kia are &lt;a href="https://uwballiance.org/"&gt;members of the UWB Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4eE6v"&gt;(Apple, Google, Samsung, LG, BMW, GM, Honda, Hyundai, and Volkswagen are all &lt;a href="https://carconnectivity.org/members/"&gt;on the board of the Car Connectivity Consortium&lt;/a&gt; as well, though that group’s promoting both NFC and UWB in its digital car key standard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mrhpJ"&gt;No matter what automakers pick, it seems likely that participation in standards bodies and global Android support will let you use (and share) your digital car key across smartphone brands. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;Samsung announced as much&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year at its Galaxy S21 event. Google says it’ll share more on standards when it launches later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UE6VL"&gt;In other Android / automotive news, Google says that cars from BMW and Ford will soon support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/31/16584442/fast-pair-android-easy-simple-bluetooth-pairing"&gt;Bluetooth Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt; to pair your Android phone with a single tap. Android Auto itself — the smartphone-based infotainment system that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/19/8259565/google-launches-android-auto"&gt;around for six years&lt;/a&gt; and directly competes with Apple’s CarPlay — has now made it into 100 million cars, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wyaio"&gt;Google also promises that going forward, the “vast majority of new vehicles” from GM, Ford, Honda, and other automakers will support Android Auto wirelessly, no need to pull your phone out of your pocket and plug it in. That’s a feature that’s been rolling out rather slowly since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/18/11700174/android-auto-update-wi-fi-support-ok-google-io-2016"&gt;its introduction in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, partially because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377399/google-android-auto-android-11-wireless-phone-support"&gt;it wasn’t native to Android phones until last August&lt;/a&gt;, partially because automakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009806/bmw-android-auto-2020-wireless-compatibility-carplay"&gt;had been holding out&lt;/a&gt; on Google-powered infotainment systems, and perhaps because Android Auto has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;methodically rolling out across the world&lt;/a&gt; instead of launching everywhere simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 preview: first look at Google’s radical new design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NXxEt5C9_5Jwqa1ndbEwoe1FHE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306674/vpavic_210517_4586_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo composite by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There are new features, but it’s the biggest design update in years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HmOieZ"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-12-beta"&gt;announcing the latest beta for Android 12&lt;/a&gt; today at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432922/google-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;. It has an entirely new design based on a system called “Material You,” featuring big, bubbly buttons, shifting colors, and smoother animations. It is “the biggest design change in Android’s history,” according to Sameer Samat, VP of product management, Android and Google Play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePUIfQ"&gt;That might be a bit of hyperbole, especially considering how many design iterations Android has seen over the past decade, but it’s justified. Android 12 exudes confidence in its design, unafraid to make everything much larger and a little more playful. Every big design change can be polarizing, and I expect Android users who prefer information density in their UI may find it a little off-putting. But in just a few days, it has already grown on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYJ09N"&gt;There are a few other functional features being tossed in beyond what’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;already been announced for the developer betas&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re fairly minor. The new design is what matters. It looks new, but Android by and large works the same — though, of course, Google can’t help itself and again shuffled around a few system-level features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOfzJO"&gt;I’ve spent a couple of hours demoing all of the new features and the subsequent few days previewing some of the new designs in the beta that’s being released today. Here’s what to expect in Android 12 when it is officially released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8Hik1w"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P90YgdXDdWW1P3VSYbBXQhVEW_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520874/1._Android_12_Keyword_Header.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s new design includes a lot of color and customization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hy3SVr"&gt;Material You design and better widgets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r40onz"&gt;Android 12 is one implementation of a new design system Google is debuting called Material You. Cue the jokes about UX versus UI versus... You, I suppose. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5841044/material-design-new-google-interface-2014"&gt;first version of Material Design&lt;/a&gt;, this new system is meant to mainly be a set of principles for creating interfaces — one that goes well beyond the original paper metaphor. Google says it will be applied across all of its products, from the web to apps to hardware to Android. Though as before, it’s likely going to take a long time for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iGTOx"&gt;In any case, the point is that the new elements in Android 12 are Google’s specific implementations of those principles on Pixel phones. Which is to say: other phones might implement those principles differently or maybe even not at all. I can tell you what Google’s version of Android 12 is going to look and act like, but only Samsung can tell you what Samsung’s version will do (and, of course, when it will arrive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eazs7r"&gt;The feature Google will be crowing the most about is that when you change your wallpaper, you’ll have the option to automatically change your system colors as well. Android 12 will pull out both dominant and complementary colors from your wallpaper automatically and apply those colors to buttons and sliders and the like. It’s neat, but I’m not personally a fan of changing button colors that much.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_MDcZaahSlqd9X0HvGSzRlqnyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520883/3._Android_12_Color_Extraction.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can customize the system colors to match your wallpaper in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e2RxSN"&gt;The lock screen is also set for some changes: the clock is huge and centered if you have no notifications and slightly smaller but still more prominent if you do. It also picks up an accent color based on the theming system. I especially love the giant clock on the always-on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FruyMz"&gt;Android’s widget system has developed a well-deserved bad reputation. Many apps don’t bother with them, and many more haven’t updated their widget’s look since they first made one in days of yore. The result is a huge swath of ugly, broken, and inconsistent widgets for the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New widget designs in Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYt851MccMn_F25lPzxOfpUTuk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521050/4._Android_12_Widgets.2021_05_17_12_42_31.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New widget designs in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OeP22y"&gt;Google is hoping to fix all of that with its new widget system. As with everything else in Android 12, the widgets Google has designed for its own apps are big and bubbly, with a playful design that’s not in keeping with how most people might think of Android. One clever feature is that when you move a widget around on your wallpaper, it subtly changes its background color to be closer to the part of the image it’s set upon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzJG3g"&gt;I don’t have especially high hopes that Android developers will rush to adopt this new widget system, so I hope Google has a plan to encourage the most-used apps to get on it. Apple came very late to the home screen widget game on the iPhone, but it’s already surpassed most of the crufty widget abandonware you’ll find from most Android apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="B7VVP5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHQPdP8qgrk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E3JI54"&gt;Bigger buttons and more animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vB5mEk"&gt;As you’ve no doubt gathered already from the photos, the most noticeable change in Android 12 is that all of the design elements are big, bubbly, and much more liberal in their use of animation. It certainly makes the entire system more legible and perhaps more accessible, but it also means you’re just going to get fewer buttons and menu items visible on a single screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apTk9Z"&gt;That tradeoff is worth it, I think. Simple things like brightness and volume sliders are just easier to adjust now, for example. As for the animations, so far, I like them. But they definitely involve more visual flourish than before. When you unlock or plug in your phone, waves of shadow and light play across the screen. Apps expand out clearly from their icon’s position, and drawers and other elements slide in and out with fade effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fFPoLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google says all of these new animations shouldn’t slow down the system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hwTSZb"&gt;More animations mean more resources and potentially more jitter, but Samat says the Android team has optimized how Android displays core elements. The windows and package manager use 22 percent less CPU time, the system server uses 15 percent less of the big (read: more powerful and battery-intensive) core on the processor, and interrupts have been reduced, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1y0dh8"&gt;Android has another reputation: solving for jitter and jank by just throwing ever-more-powerful hardware at the problem: faster chips, higher refresh rate screens, and the like. Hopefully none of that will be necessary to keep these animations smooth on lower-end devices. On my Pixel 5, they’ve been quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku4EJp"&gt;One last bit: there’s a new “overscroll” animation — the thing the screen does when you scroll to the end of a page. Now, everything on the screen will sort of stretch a bit when you can’t scroll any further. Maybe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/06/22/apple-granted-patent-webpage-scrolling-behaviors-media-crazy"&gt;an Apple patent expired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SxFnl0"&gt;Shuffling system spaces around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Z3nPkl"&gt;It wouldn’t be a new version of Android without Google mucking about with notifications, Google Assistant, or what happens when you press the power button. With Android 12, we’ve hit the trifecta. Luckily, the changes Google has made mostly represent walking back some of the changes it made in Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZbIkw"&gt;The combined Quick Settings / notifications shade remains mostly the same — though the huge buttons mean you’re going to see fewer of them in either collapsed or expanded views. The main difference in notifications is mostly aesthetic. Like everything else, they’re big and bubbly. There’s a big, easy-to-hit down arrow for expanding them, and groups of notifications are put together into one bigger bubble. There’s even a nice little visual flourish when you begin to swipe a notification away: it forms its own roundrect, indicating that it has become a discrete object.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3ABhSo1zSov0nBD1V-dWXdUkR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520893/6._Andriod_12_Redesigned_System_Services.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The quick settings and notification shade have gotten a facelift in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dVP28a"&gt;The thing that will please a lot of Android users is that after just a year, Google has bailed on its idea of creating a whole new power button menu with Google Wallet and smart home controls. Instead, both of those things are just buttons inside the quick settings shade, similar to Samsung’s solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygp3tK"&gt;Holding down the power button now just brings up Google Assistant. Samat says it was a necessary change because Google Assistant is going to begin to offer more contextually aware features based on whatever screen you’re looking at. I say the diagonal swipe-in from the corner to launch Assistant was terrible, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it seriously reduced how much people used it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxpSeS"&gt;I also have to point out that it’s a case of Google adopting gestures already popular on other phones: the iPhone’s button power brings up Siri, and a Galaxy’s button brings up Bixby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New privacy features in Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eK0XNaiACYx9xBW_jeXuUBWEiU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521060/privacy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New privacy features in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6RKIgT"&gt;New privacy features for camera, mic, and location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lFnLt4"&gt;Google is doing a few things with privacy in Android 12, mostly focused on three key sensors it sees as trigger points for people: location, camera, and microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viHYUQ"&gt;The camera and mic will now flip on a little green dot in the upper-right of the screen, indicating that they’re on. There are also now two optional toggles in Quick Settings for turning them off entirely at a system level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hy2mmr"&gt;When an app tries to use one of them, Android will pop up a box asking if you want to turn it back on. If you choose not to, the app &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; it has access to the camera or mic, but all Android gives it is a black nothingness and silence. It’s a mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="by9gez"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 12 will let you limit location access to an approximation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tcxZ3O"&gt;For location, Google is adding another option for what kind of access you can grant an app. Alongside the options to limit access to one time or just when the app is open, there are settings for granting either “approximate” or “precise” locations. Approximate will let the app know your location with less precision, so it theoretically can’t guess your exact address. Google suggests it could be useful for things like weather apps. (Note that any permissions you’ve already granted will be grandfathered in, so you’ll need to dig into settings to switch them to approximate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVgzXg"&gt;Google is also creating a new “Privacy Dashboard” specifically focused on location, mic, and camera. It presents a pie chart of how many times each has been accessed in the last 24 hours along with a timeline of each time it was used. You can tap in and get to the settings for any app from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r8bJD0"&gt;The Android Private Compute Core&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="y4Hd6w"&gt;Another new privacy feature is the unfortunately named “Android Private Compute Core.” Unfortunately, because when most people think of a “core,” they assume there’s an actual physical chip involved. Instead, think of the APCC as a sandboxed part of Android 12 for doing AI stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnu2TX"&gt;Essentially, a bunch of Android machine learning functions are going to be run inside the APCC. It is walled-off from the rest of the OS, and the functions inside it are specifically not allowed any kind of network access. It literally cannot send or receive data from the cloud, Google says. The only way to communicate with the functions inside it is via specific APIs, which Google emphasizes are “open source” as some kind of talisman of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dv4Y5t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Private Compute Core isn’t a physical chip, but a walled-off section of the Android software&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ymoOQ"&gt;Talisman or no, it’s a good idea. The operations that run inside the APCC include Android’s feature for ambiently identifying playing music. That needs to have the microphone listening on a very regular basis, so it’s the sort of thing you’d want to keep local. The APCC also hands the “smart chips” for auto-reply buttons based on your own language usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHTeO0"&gt;An easier way to think of it is if there’s an AI function you might think is creepy, Google is running it inside the APCC so its powers are limited. And it’s also a sure sign that Google intends to introduce more AI features into Android in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qapyhl"&gt;No news on app tracking — yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V4Ey5o"&gt;Location, camera, mic, and machine learning are all privacy vectors to lock down, but they’re not the kind of privacy that’s on everybody’s mind right now. The more urgent concern in the last few months is app tracking for ad purposes. Apple has just locked all of that down with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"&gt;App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt; feature. Google itself is still planning on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;blocking third-party cookies in Chrome and replacing them with anonymizing technology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oK692V"&gt;What about Android? There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266823/google-anti-tracking-feature-android-privacy-apple-ios-app-tracking-transparency"&gt;rumors that Google is considering some kind of system similar to Apple’s&lt;/a&gt;, but there won’t be any announcements about it at Google I/O. However, Samat confirmed to me that his team is working on something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PcqqJA"&gt;There’s obviously a lot changing in the ecosystem. One thing about Google is it is a platform company. It’s also a company that is deep in the advertising space. So we’re thinking very deeply about how we should evolve the advertising system. You see what we’re doing on Chrome. &lt;br&gt;From our standpoint on Android, we don’t have anything to announce at the moment, but we are taking a position that privacy and advertising don’t need to be directly opposed to each other. That, we don’t believe, is healthy for the overall ecosystem as a company. So we’re thinking about that working with our developer partners and we’ll be sharing more later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Android TV remote in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WxTeaj"&gt;A few other features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UgHvys"&gt;Google has already announced a bunch of features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;earlier developer betas&lt;/a&gt;, most of which are under-the-hood kind of features. There are “improved accessibility features for people with impaired vision, scrolling screenshots, conversation widgets that bring your favorite people to the home screen” and the already-announced improved support for third-party app stores. On top of those, there are a few neat little additions to mention today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMa6SK"&gt;First, Android 12 will (finally) have a built-in remote that will work with Android TV systems like the Chromecast with Google TV or Sony TVs. Google is also promising to work with partners to get car unlocking working via NFC and (if a phone supports it) UWB. It will be available on “select Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones” later this year, and BMW is on board to support it in future vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOQ0G9s8Cor0QWPlQOwiQB4ZxNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520913/2._Chromebook_Phone_Hub.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 will add some new integrations between Android phones and Chromebooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YdlII5"&gt;For people with Chromebooks, Google is continuing the trend of making them work better with Android phones. Later this year, Chrome OS devices will be able to immediately access new photos in an Android phone’s photo library over Wi-Fi Direct instead of waiting for them to sync up to the Google Photos cloud. Google still doesn’t have anything as good as AirDrop for quickly sending files across multiple kinds of devices, but it’s a good step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sccDR1"&gt;Android already has fast pairing for quickly setting up Bluetooth devices, but it’s not built into the Bluetooth spec. Instead, Google has to work with individual manufacturers to enable it. A new one is coming on board today: Beats, which is owned by Apple. (Huh!) Ford and BMW cars will also support one-tap pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NvuAka"&gt;Android Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LVMP6n"&gt;As always, no story about a new version of Android would be complete without pointing out that the only phones guaranteed to get it in a timely manner are Google’s own Pixel phones. However, Google has made some strides in the past few years. Samat says that there has been a year-over-year improvement in the “speed of updates” to the tune of 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FtVtK"&gt;A few years ago, Google changed the architecture of Android with something called Project Treble. It made the system a little more modular, which, in turn, made it easier for Android manufacturers to apply their custom versions of Android without mucking about in the core of it. That should mean faster updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKPlCq"&gt;Some companies have improved slightly, including the most important one, Samsung. However, it’s still slow going, especially for older devices. As &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3606708/android-11-upgrade-report-card.html"&gt;JR Raphael has pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, most companies are not getting updates out in what should be a perfectly reasonable timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="8BguUT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pixel phones will still be the first devices to get Android 12&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1em425"&gt;Beyond Treble, there may be some behind-the-scenes pressure happening. More and more companies are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;committing to providing updates for longer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22178833/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-faster-android-updates-four-years"&gt;Google also is working directly with Qualcomm to speed up updates&lt;/a&gt;. Since Qualcomm is, for all intents and purposes, the monopoly chip provider for Android phones in the US, that should make a big difference, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlMTdw"&gt;That’s all heartening, but it’s important to set expectations appropriately. Android will never match iOS in terms of providing timely near-universal updates as soon as a new version of the OS is available. There will always be a gap between the Android release and its availability for non-Pixel phones. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;That’s just the way the Android ecosystem works&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2w36Getujii2o-BWYRePGKXm_p4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520915/vpavic_210517_4586_0020.0_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7Jf6pv"&gt;That’s Android 12. It may not be the biggest feature drop in years, but it is easily the biggest visual overhaul in some time. And Android needed it. Over time and over multiple iterations, lots of corners of the OS were getting a little crufty as new ideas piled on top of each other. Android 12 doesn’t completely wipe the slate clean and start over, but it’s a significant and ambitious attempt to make the whole system feel more coherent and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="FqH14O"&gt;The beta that’s available this week won’t get there — the version I’m using lacks the theming features, widgets, and plenty more. Those features should get layered in as we approach the official release later this year. Assuming that Google can get this fresh paint into all of the corners, it will make Google’s version of Android a much more enjoyable thing to use.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FBZbAy"&gt;There are over 3 billion active Android devices in the wild now. Sameer Samat, VP of product management at Google, announced the news at Google I/O 2021, which is live, but totally online, this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrx9mk"&gt;Google added over 500 million active Android devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18528297/google-io-2019-android-devices-play-store-total-number-statistic-keynote"&gt;since its last developer’s conference in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and 1 billion devices since 2017. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654454/android-reaches-2-billion-monthly-active-users"&gt;That was when it hit the 2 billion mark&lt;/a&gt;.) The number is taken from the Google Play Store, which doesn’t take into account devices based on Android but that use alternative stores, including Amazon Fire devices and the myriad of Chinese Android-based devices that avoid using Google’s apps altogether. That means the number of active Android devices is likely much higher than what Samat announced on the live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEkgGQ"&gt;The news feels like a flex against Apple, too. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021"&gt;announced over 1 billion active iPhones&lt;/a&gt; in the wild earlier this year — a mere third of the number of Android devices. It’s a bold reminder that Apple’s smartphone and tablet dominance is largely limited to the United States and a few other regions. For everywhere else, it’s Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xwx3ma"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22200447"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google I/O 2021 live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos is adding a locked folder for your private images</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFnc8br2Z38trrXGVZ3o_51oxg8=/75x0:1176x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306573/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_10.46.16_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTqvDv"&gt;Google is introducing a new feature to Google Photos that lets you hide specific pictures so they won’t show up in your photo feed or in other apps. The feature, called Locked Folder, will put whatever sensitive pictures you’d rather not share behind a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2b6ROx"&gt;In its I/O presentation, Google used the example of parents trying to keep a puppy purchase secret from their kids — though the feature should be useful for any sensitive images that you don’t want to share with others. It’s easy to see how this feature could be useful: who hasn’t handed their phone to someone to show off one or two pictures, then suddenly realized, “Wow, I hope they don’t scroll too far to the left or right”? Locked Folder will help Photos users avoid that fear by keeping whatever sensitive pictures you’ve got on the service out of your main photos feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gBY8Zf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;With Locked Folder in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlephotos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@googlephotos&lt;/a&gt;, you can add photos to a passcode protected space and they won’t show up as you scroll through Photos or other apps on your phone. Locked Folder is launching first on Google Pixel, and more Android devices throughout the year. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleIO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleIO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/yGNoQ8vLdq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yGNoQ8vLdq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1394710047213633536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MxYKAn"&gt;Google says the feature will launch first on Pixels but will be coming to more Android phones “throughout the year.” Similar features have been available through third-party apps already, and many Samsung users already have access to a &lt;a href="https://www.samsungknox.com/en/solutions/personal-apps/secure-folder"&gt;Secure Folder feature&lt;/a&gt; included on some Galaxy phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is Ford’s electric F-150 pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1LYoECtyqHSiROiLzSoVoYwso3I=/350x0:3239x1926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306561/f150_lightning.6.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CNBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bm8D58"&gt;Ford has revealed the all-electric F-150 pickup truck one day ahead of schedule. The truck, dubbed F-150 Lightning, was on display Tuesday at Ford’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan during a speech from President Biden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBjjlp"&gt;Images from the event show that the F-150 Lightning largely looks like its gas and hybrid counterparts, though the truck has a more modern grille, with an unbroken light bar that stretches from headlight to headlight. And even from a distance, it seems that the F-150 Lightning will have a large portrait touchscreen similar to the one in the Mustang Mach-E.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_X6N0gqd4FrZJ5keLFE1v46z_Sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523354/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_12.54.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CNBC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yCFQgJ"&gt;The F-150 EV has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441793/ford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details"&gt;years in the making&lt;/a&gt; and is the second mass-market electric vehicle from Ford, following the Mustang Mach-E. The company is set to reveal full pricing, specifications, and other details about the electric pickup truck Wednesday at 9:30PM ET. But the truck is expected to be one of the most powerful F-150s ever made, and it will serve as a huge test of the appetite for an all-electric version of the most popular vehicle in the country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Igyi4n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And there it is. The electric &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ford?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Ford&lt;/a&gt; F-150 Lightning ahead of comments by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@POTUS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/IF0baIT55w"&gt;pic.twitter.com/IF0baIT55w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Wayland (@MikeWayland) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeWayland/status/1394709687396966404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YK3ENU"&gt;Biden used Tuesday’s speech to stump for his infrastructure plan, which is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/18/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-supercharges-the-future-of-transportation-and-manufacturing/"&gt;big on electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and EV charging technology&lt;/a&gt;. “The future of the auto industry is electric. There’s no turning back,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iH7WiA"&gt;Biden also focused heavily on how he wants automakers to build their electric vehicles in the United States with American parts and labor — a topic that has become especially hot after General Motors announced &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/04/29/gm-invest-billion-build-ev-mexico-uaw-angry/7403340002/"&gt;it would build some electric vehicles in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Ford will build the electric F-150 at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, but is currently building the Mustang Mach-E in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvF3RG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
