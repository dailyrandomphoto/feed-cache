    <title>Inside Facebook’s struggle to keep young people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CnHYnQ97Awli9RgRIXKsSldP00I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70040973/acastro_211024_4821_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The world’s largest social network is internally grappling with an existential crisis: an aging user base&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OO8X8q"&gt;Earlier this year, a researcher at Facebook shared some alarming statistics with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBRnqM"&gt;Teenage users of the Facebook app in the US had declined by 13 percent since 2019 and were projected to drop 45 percent over the next two years, driving an overall decline in daily users in the company’s most lucrative ad market. Young adults between the ages of 20 and 30 were expected to decline by 4 percent during the same timeframe. Making matters worse, the younger a user was, the less on average they regularly engaged with the app. The message was clear: Facebook was losing traction with younger generations fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HS06Y"&gt;The “aging up issue is real,” the researcher wrote in an internal memo. They predicted that, if “increasingly fewer teens are choosing Facebook as they grow older,” the company would face a more “severe” decline in young users than it already projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGqcq3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The “aging up issue is real”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6J1i6"&gt;The findings, echoed by other internal documents and my conversations with current and former employees, show that Facebook sees its aging user base as an existential threat to the long-term health of its business and that it’s trying desperately to correct the problem with little indication that its strategy will work. If it doesn’t correct course, the 17-year-old social network could, for the first time, lose out on an entire generation. And while Instagram remains incredibly popular with teens, Facebook’s own data shows that they are starting to engage with the app less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V80Ktw"&gt;The internal documents are part of disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by legal counsel for Frances Haugen, an ex-Facebook employee turned prominent whistleblower. A consortium of news organizations, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has obtained the redacted versions received by Congress. Some documents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;served as the basis for earlier reporting in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M29wOz"&gt;Facebook’s struggle to attract users under the age of 30 has been ongoing for years, dating back to as early as 2012. But according to the documents, the problem has grown more severe recently. And the stakes are high. While it famously started as a networking site for college students, employees have predicted that the aging up of the app’s audience — now nearly 2 billion daily users — has the potential to further alienate young people, cutting off future generations and putting a ceiling on future growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvK1m5"&gt;The problem explains why the company has taken such a keen interest in courting young people and even pre-teens to its main app and Instagram, spinning up dedicated youth teams to cater to them. In 2017, it debuted a standalone Messenger app for kids, and its plans for a version of Instagram for kids were recently shelved after lawmakers decried the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0f9O5"&gt;At the same time, a rising crop of younger social networks has continued growing in popularity with young people — a phenomenon Facebook has closely tracked with its own research. In an internal presentation earlier this year, employees estimated that teens spend 2–3x more time on TikTok than on Instagram and that Snapchat is the preferred method of communicating with best friends for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoIhKQ"&gt;“Our products are still widely used by teens, but we face tough competition from the likes of Snapchat and TikTok,” Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson, said in response to questions about the documents cited in this story. “All social media companies want teens to use their services. We are no different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XhZgB3"&gt;Declining numbers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zQPe7V"&gt;In March of this year, a team of data scientists at Facebook presented the company’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, with “heath scorecards” for Facebook and Instagram’s usage among teens and young adults. Instagram was still strong with young people but losing engagement in key markets, including the US, Australia, and Japan. And the age of Facebook’s user base was increasing rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lEqwmu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A wide range of negative associations with Facebook”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ek8GxR"&gt;“Most young adults perceive Facebook as a place for people in their 40s and 50s,” according to the presentation. “Young adults perceive content as boring, misleading, and negative. They often have to get past irrelevant content to get to what matters.” It added that they “have a wide range of negative associations with Facebook including privacy concerns, impact to their wellbeing, along with low awareness of relevant services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5PCMc"&gt;The March presentation to Cox showed that, in the US, “teen acquisition is low and regressing further.” Account registrations for users under 18 were down 26 percent from the previous year in the app’s five top countries. For teens already on Facebook, the company was continuing to “see lower or worsening levels of engagement compared to older cohorts.” Messages sent by teens were down 16 percent from the previous year, while messages sent by users aged 20–30 were flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCIZEg"&gt;A “particularly concerning trend,” according to one slide, was that time spent in the Facebook app by young people in the US had declined from the period before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year, when usage of Facebook’s services momentarily spiked across the board. Another slide described “addressing the existing engagement gap” between younger and older users, saying that people older than 30 in the US were spending, on average, 24 more minutes per day on Facebook than younger users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VDjWdB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Average age will continue to increase, potentially disengaging younger users even more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hiGceE"&gt;Facebook internally measures its user base against population estimates from the United Nations for specific countries. If the social network has the same amount of monthly users in an age bracket as what the estimates say for that region, it’s fully saturated. The presentation to Cox explained that the average Facebook user age “has been increasing disproportionately to the average population age over time. If this continues, [the Facebook app’s] average age will continue to increase, potentially disengaging younger users even more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pdkNp"&gt;Instagram was doing better with young people, with full saturation in the US, France, the UK, Japan, and Australia. But there was still cause for concern. Posting by teens had dropped 13 percent from 2020 and “remains the most concerning trend,” the researchers noted, adding that the increased use of TikTok by teens meant that “we are likely losing our total share of time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XnThD8"&gt;Product sprint&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKH7LE5L9uQLFR60bqw6GS-kB0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22952507/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.05.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from a section of an internal Facebook presentation from earlier this year called “Teen Fundamentals.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDSTvJ"&gt;To address the growing crisis, employees at Facebook and Instagram have, for the past year, been planning a slew of products tailored for teens and young adults, according to the internal documents. But they recognize that it’s going to be an uphill battle on both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wTBhOv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A brand tax we need to get ahead of”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1RdOf"&gt;Young adults “feel Facebook shouldn’t be the place for rants and charged opinions, even though it seems prevalent on the platform,” according to a November 2020 strategy document about targeting young adults. “External forces such as negative media coverage further tarnish this perception,” it continued, equating to “a brand tax we need to get ahead of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRP6gT"&gt;In order to address the “significant risk” of young adults engaging less and less with Facebook over time, employees last November identified two “beached” areas of focus, allowing “us to establish credibility and gain trust for extension into future areas” like mental health products. They laid out a multi-year plan to “enable young adults to connect with mentors for professional guidance” and “engage in meaningful conversations around causes to take action locally with others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKZ0Sm"&gt;Planned features included asking young people to update their friend networks to make them more relevant since their connections “are often dormant and they struggle to realize any value” from them after collecting hundreds of friends over the years. They began work to tweak the News Feed algorithm specifically for young adults, with the goal of testing the change as early as the second half of this year, in order to show them “unconnected” content from accounts they didn’t choose to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4pgAI"&gt;The employees also discussed letting young people set different profile identities that were specific to certain Facebook groups. Other products included a more visual version of the News Feed tentatively called Spotlight and “mood feeds” to increase “visitation and engagement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Js4S3JCNXYM5muWYLz8Z9LSsGg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22952536/Screen_Shot_2021_10_24_at_6.10.25_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design examples of Facebook features geared toward young people from November of last year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HMuxnE"&gt;The documents show that, as part of its youth push, Facebook has been working on an unreleased version of Facebook Groups called Groups+, slated in the November document to begin testing as soon as this year, that is intended to let people join groups for specific personalities and “close-knit communities” as a way to “increase cultural relevance.” A whole pillar of products targeting people between the ages of 20 and 30 is focused on competing with LinkedIn, allowing people to host resumes and browse for jobs or career advice in a specialized feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvrJwo"&gt;Joe Osborne, the Facebook spokesperson, said, “We continuously explore new products and experiences for people, but these efforts either evolved or never left the exploration phase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ZEQUBy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Seven percent of teens report experiencing bullying on Instagram&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUvsqP"&gt;For Instagram, much of the product work targeting young people has recently focused on reducing the negative experiences of social comparison and bullying that they report. A presentation from earlier this year said that 7 percent of teens report experiencing bullying on Instagram and that 40 percent of all bullying happened in private messages. Other internal research documents, some of which were earlier &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;reported on by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show that teens have told the company they experience negative social comparison and even depression from using Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk0xVX"&gt;Sixty-one percent of new teen accounts on Instagram choose to make their profiles private on initial setup, the presentation said, adding that Instagram employees wanted to make “nudging” product tweaks to encourage more young users to set their accounts to private. The documents show that secondary, private “finsta” accounts have also been exploding in popularity, especially among Instagram’s youngest users — behavior that employees want to encourage as a way to retain young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjhumCAD3PMICC-0zRRAFSpfRjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22952531/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_10.05.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s researchers have internally set up an ongoing workstream to understand teens and what they want, as detailed in part here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yqMmx5"&gt;“Teens seek a way to connect with their friends, but don’t want to share with all their followers,” the company’s researchers wrote in one recent document. “They want to easily share with just the people that they trust so that they feel seen, accepted, and validated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATBljo"&gt;Attracting young people and keeping them engaged remains top of mind inside Instagram. Adam Mosseri, the head of the app, in May told employees that Instagram’s goal is to be “a place where young people define themselves and the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/16/technology/instagram-teens.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3Fwl9G"&gt;An uncertain future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EClbAWE9lwUN8K3T6Bzy1mPNU_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22952487/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.28.10_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slide from an internal Facebook presentation earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XzXNa"&gt;Losing young people wasn’t always the existential threat for the blue Facebook app that it is now, according to Michael Sayman, a 25-year-old former product manager for youth products who joined the company in 2014 when he was just 17. With the rise of selfie cameras in phones, social apps became more visual while Facebook stayed mostly focused on text posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B8tEM"&gt;Copying Stories from Snapchat — which reduced the pressure people feel to share everyday snippets of their lives by making them disappear — has helped keep younger users on Instagram, as has encouraging the use of multiple accounts. But Facebook’s use by young people has stayed on a consistent decline. By the time Sayman left in 2017, “the company had understood very clearly the importance,” he told me. “It’s an entire generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVblDA"&gt;Nowadays, teens are increasingly flocking to more immersive, social game platforms like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or Sayman’s current employer, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. These 3D worlds with custom avatars appeal to young people who are looking to be online without the pressure of people judging their appearance or surroundings. And while a lot of traditional social media can feel like a performance, these virtual game worlds are fun. Incidentally, Facebook is planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;rebrand its corporate name&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the metaverse, which could partly be an effort to try to appeal to young people again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qKPux8"&gt;For now, Facebook isn’t even sure if its plans to win back young people are enough. As the March presentation to Cox bluntly said: “We believe it’s too early to assess the effectiveness of our current suite of big bets for teens on Instagram and young adults on Facebook, and whether they are sufficient given the current competitive landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The tier list: how Facebook decides which countries need protection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmowjFhZoA9qQHZKu1KziuKz0CI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70040976/acastro_211024_4823_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Leaked documents reveal a huge, opaque system&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ylgaGq"&gt;At the end of 2019, the group of Facebook employees charged with preventing harms on the network gathered to discuss the year ahead. At the Civic Summit, as it was called, leaders announced where they would invest resources to provide enhanced protections around upcoming global elections — and also where they would not. In a move that has become standard at the company, Facebook had sorted the world’s countries into tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w84FAD"&gt;Brazil, India, and the United States were placed in “tier zero,” the highest priority. Facebook set up “war rooms” to monitor the network continuously. They created dashboards to analyze network activity and alerted local election officials to any problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZYNrG"&gt;Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, and Italy were placed in tier one. They would be given similar resources, minus some resources for enforcement of Facebook’s rules and for alerts outside the period directly around the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HraIyz"&gt;In tier two, 22 countries were added. They would have to go without the war rooms, which Facebook also calls “enhanced operations centers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1z5TK"&gt;The rest of the world was placed into tier three. Facebook would review election-related material if it was escalated to them by content moderators. Otherwise, it would not intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0OhO8f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Documents show significant variation in content moderation resources afforded to different countries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HpukLS"&gt;The system is described in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Frances Haugen’s legal counsel. A consortium of news organizations, including &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has obtained the redacted versions received by Congress. Some documents &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;served as the basis for earlier reporting in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23Ibsw"&gt;The files contain a wealth of documents describing the company’s internal research, its efforts to promote users’ safety and well-being, and its struggles to remain relevant to a younger audience. They highlight the degree to which Facebook employees are aware of the gaps in their knowledge about issues in the public interest, and their efforts to learn more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lei64"&gt;But if one theme stands out more than others, it’s the significant variation in content moderation resources afforded to different countries based on criteria that are not public or subject to external review. For Facebook’s home country of the United States, and other countries considered at high risk of political violence of social instability, Facebook offers an enhanced suite of services designed to protect the public discourse: translating the service and its community standards into the official languages; building AI classifiers to detect hate speech and misinformation in those languages; and staffing teams to analyze viral content and respond quickly to hoaxes and incitement to violence on a 24/7 basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wcu8o"&gt;Other countries, such as Ethiopia, may not even have the company’s community standards translated into all of its official languages. Machine learning classifiers to detect hate speech and other harms are not available. Fact-checking partners don’t exist. War rooms never open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MMGsk"&gt;For a regular company, it’s hardly controversial to allocate resources differently based on market conditions. But given Facebook’s key role in civic discourse — it effectively replaces the internet in some countries — the disparities are cause for concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJSPzR"&gt;For years now, activists and lawmakers around the world have criticized the company for the inequality in its approach to content moderation. But the Facebook Papers offer a detailed look into where Facebook provides a higher standard of care — and where it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMULTd"&gt;Among the disparities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="it2TUH"&gt;Facebook lacked misinformation classifiers in Myanmar, Pakistan, and Ethiopia, countries designated at highest risk last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aHCdi0"&gt;It also lacked hate speech classifiers in Ethiopia, which is in the midst of a bloody civil conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UzTt6N"&gt;In December 2020, an effort to place language experts into countries had only succeeded in six of ten “tier one” countries and zero tier two countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="grLG7u"&gt;Miranda Sissons, Facebook’s director of human rights policy, told me that allocating resources in this way reflects the best practices suggested by the United Nations in its &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf"&gt;Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;. Those principles require businesses to consider the human rights impact of their work and work to mitigate any issues based on their scale, severity, and whether the company can design an effective remedy for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztzaCa"&gt;Sissons, a career human rights activist and diplomat, joined Facebook in 2019. That was the year the company began developing its approach to what the company calls “at-risk countries” — places where social cohesion is declining and where Facebook’s network and powers of amplification risk incitements to violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YpNbL7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook can conduct sophisticated intelligence operations when it chooses to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Uu2CC"&gt;The threat is real: other documents in the Facebook Papers detail how new accounts created in India that year would quickly be exposed to a tide of hate speech and misinformation if they followed Facebook’s recommendations. (&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html"&gt;detailed this research on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;.) And even at home in the United States, where Facebook invests the most in content moderation, documents reflect the degree to which employees were overwhelmed by the flood of misinformation on the platform leading up to the January 6th Capitol attack. (&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and others &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/"&gt;described these records over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTi6mH"&gt;Documents show that Facebook can conduct sophisticated intelligence operations when it chooses to. An undated case study into “adversarial harm networks in India” examined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, a nationalist, anti-Muslim paramilitary organization, and its use of groups and pages to spread inflammatory and misleading content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRC4hi"&gt;The investigation found that a single user in the RSS had generated more than 30 million views. But the investigation noted that, to a large extent, Facebook is flying blind: “Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfeUld"&gt;One solution could be to penalize RSS accounts. But the group’s ties to India’s nationalist government made that a delicate proposition. “We have yet to put forth a nomination for designation of this group given political sensitivities,” the authors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSBwRG"&gt;Facebook likely spends more on integrity efforts than any of its peers, though it is also the largest of the social networks. Sissons told me that ideally, the company’s community standards and AI content moderation capabilities would be translated into every country where Facebook is operating. But even the United Nations &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/our-work/official-languages#:~:text=There%20are%20six%20official%20languages,%2C%20French%2C%20Russian%20and%20Spanish."&gt;supports only six official languages&lt;/a&gt;; Facebook has native speakers moderating posts in more than 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7dAy4"&gt;Even in countries where Facebook’s tiers appear to limit its investments, Sissons said, the company’s systems regularly scan the world for political instability or other risks of escalating violence so that the company can adapt. Some projects, such as training new hate speech classifiers, are expensive and take many months. But other interventions can be implemented quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWzDgJ"&gt;Still, documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; also show the way that cost pressures appear to affect the company’s approach to policing the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IashWA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These are not easy trade-offs to make.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKUIge"&gt;In a May 2019 note titled “Maximizing the Value of Human Review,” the company announced that it would create new hurdles to users reporting hate speech in hopes of reducing the burden on its content moderators. It also said it would automatically close reports without resolving them in cases where few people had seen the post or the issue reported was not severe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRBPQt"&gt;The author of the note said that 75 percent of the time, reviewers found hate speech reports did not violate Facebook’s community standards and that reviewers’ time would be better spent proactively looking for worse violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQPIPL"&gt;But there were concerns about expenses as well. “We’re clearly running ahead of our [third-party content moderation] review budget due to front-loading enforcement work and will have to reduce capacity (via efficiency improvements and natural rep attrition) to meet the budget,” the author wrote. “This will require real reductions in viewer capacity through the end of the year, forcing trade-offs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BY3ZXg"&gt;Employees have also found their resources strained in the high-risk countries that the tier system identifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNX99h"&gt;“These are not easy trade-offs to make,” notes the introduction to a note titled “Managing hostile speech in at-risk countries sustainably.” (Facebook abbreviates these countries as “ARCs.”)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGdVIW"&gt;“Supporting ARCs also comes at a high cost for the team in terms of crisis response. In the past months, we’ve been asked to firefight for India election, violent clashes in Bangladesh, and protests in Pakistan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdHojb"&gt;The note says that after a country is designated a “priority,” it typically takes a year to build classifiers for hate speech and to improve enforcement. But not everything gets to be a priority, and the trade-offs are difficult indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwIPTb"&gt;“We should prioritize building classifiers for countries with on-going violence … rather than temporary violence,” the note reads. “For the latter case, we should rely on rapid response tools instead.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0XoJVS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A pervasive sense that, on some fundamental level, no one is entirely sure what’s going on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0GDoJP"&gt;After reviewing hundreds of documents and interviewing current and former Facebook employees about them, it’s clear that a large contingent of workers within the company are trying diligently to rein in the platform’s worst abuses, using a variety of systems that are dizzying in their scope, scale, and sophistication. It’s also clear that they are facing external pressures over which they have no control — the rising right-wing authoritarianism of the United States and India did not begin on the platform, and the power of individual figures like Donald Trump and Narendra Modi to promote violence and instability should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t55mlY"&gt;And yet, it’s also hard not to marvel once again at Facebook’s sheer size; the staggering complexity of understanding how it works, even for the people charged with operating it; the opaque nature of systems like its at-risk countries “work stream”; and the lack of accountability in cases where, as in Myanmar, the whole thing spun violently out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdYrWy"&gt;Some of the most fascinating documents in the Facebook Papers are also the most mundane: cases where one employee or another wonders out loud what might happen if Facebook changed this input to that one or ratcheted down this harm at the expense of that growth metric. Other times, the documents find them struggling to explain why the algorithm shows more “civic content” to men than women or why a bug let some violence-inciting group in Sri Lanka automatically add half a million people to a group — without their consent — over a three-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8YOAE"&gt;There is a pervasive sense that, on some fundamental level, no one is entirely sure what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFkeLE"&gt;In the documents, comment threads pile up as everyone scratches their heads. Employees quit and leak them to the press. The communications team reviews the findings and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/approach-to-countries-at-risk/"&gt;writes up a somber blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and affirms that There Is More Work To Do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JStR70"&gt;Congress growls. Facebook changes its name. The world’s countries, neatly arranged into tiers, hold their breath.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord now shares more details of your EA gameplay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_YH9TCYp1lW5ybnDdup1P64VSk=/1x0:1456x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70040919/discord_status.png.adapt.1456w.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xMkhhP"&gt;EA is adding support for Discord’s “Rich Presence” feature to some of its titles, which allows your Discord contacts to see more information about what you’re up to in-game, the &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-discord-rich-presence?isLocalized=true"&gt;game maker has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It works by linking your Discord account with the &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/ea-app"&gt;EA App&lt;/a&gt;, the new launcher that’s a successor to EA’s Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjN8f3"&gt;Previously, Discord would show what EA game you were playing, and for how long. But EA’s Rich Presence integration allows Discord to show off more detailed information like “which game mode you’re in, how long you’ve been playing, and whether or not you’re ready to partner up for something different,” EA says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="64lyK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll even show if you’re interested in partnering up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nHMTL"&gt;Discord’s &lt;a href="https://discord.com/rich-presence"&gt;Rich Presence feature&lt;/a&gt; is already supported across other games like &lt;em&gt;Payday 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlerite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin 2&lt;/em&gt;, but EA’s integration has the potential to be a lot broader because it’s happening at the launcher level (via the EA App) rather than the individual game level. As well as showing more information about the game you’re playing, developers can also use it to allow players to invite each other to their games, or to spectate their friends’ matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWYJXi"&gt;You can enable the new Discord integration in the &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-app-beta"&gt;EA App&lt;/a&gt; by heading into Settings, selecting My Account, and scrolling down to the Connected Accounts section and authorizing a link between your Discord and EA accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla pulled its latest ‘Full Self Driving’ beta after testers complained about false crash warnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yg-own5UM7gyR_M6vvhY2Ps37M8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70039535/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hb1LmE"&gt;Tesla’s decision to test its “Full Self Driving” advanced driver assistance software with untrained vehicle owners on public roads has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;, and that was before this latest release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROpYYm"&gt;Version 10.3 began rolling out on Saturday night / Sunday morning with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qem0lu/fsd_bets_103_release_notes/"&gt;a long list of release notes&lt;/a&gt;. The list mentions changes starting with introducing driver profiles that can swap between different characteristics for following distance, rolling stops, or exiting passing lanes. It’s supposed to better detect brake lights, turn signals, and hazard lights from other vehicles, along with reduced false slowdowns and improved offsetting for pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhd4yD"&gt;However, on Sunday afternoon Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla is “Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QYMrRz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U72sUl"&gt;(As always, to be clear: this software does not make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself even said that he believes the “feature complete” version of the software his company calls “Full Self-Driving” will, at best, only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision. That does not describe a fully autonomous car.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSWpau"&gt;While several drivers have already &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GTtBe2eOhk"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_hn-Iu4Y7M"&gt;videos and impressions&lt;/a&gt; of their experience with the release — whether or not that aligns with what Tesla wants participants to share on social media — testers say that the rollback update removes the FSD beta capabilities from their cars entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWSAjH"&gt;While several posters said the 10.3 update introduces phantom forward collision warnings (FCW), &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qeu10x/known_fsd_beta_103_taccautosteer_bug/"&gt;other issues noted&lt;/a&gt; included a disappearing Autosteer option, traffic aware cruise control (TACC) problems, and occasional AutoPilot panic. It’s unclear how common these problems are and which ones, if any, caused the rollback, but Musk responded to a tweet about the Autosteer and TACC issues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452330803015335939"&gt;saying the company is working on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7kmYq"&gt;If it’s a common problem within the test group, then a phantom FCW would certainly be serious enough to initiate a rollback. &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-25-mazda3-smart-braking-system-recall.html"&gt;In 2019 there was a Mazda3 recall&lt;/a&gt; to address problems with the Smart Braking System falsely detecting objects in the car’s path. If another car follows closely, vehicles that suddenly slam on the brakes for no reason — as several social media posts claim has happened —  could easily cause an accident. Another problem for testers is that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeslaTomMY1/status/1452360696281264132"&gt;several claimed&lt;/a&gt; the false FCW incidents lowered their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;Tesla-graded “safety score”&lt;/a&gt; low enough that they might not be able to remain in the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="h8buPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Safety regulator wants info on Tesla’s FSD beta, ‘safety score’ evaluation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"},{"title":"Tesla privately admits Elon Musk has been exaggerating about ‘full self-driving’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xwjln8"&gt;For anyone concerned with being an unwilling member of the test group by simply existing near a Tesla using work-in-progress software, this could be a sign that the company is addressing problems quickly or an example of how dangerous it is. On the other hand, for Tesla owners hoping the test expands to include people with a lower safety score, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1448066773589401606"&gt;hacker @greentheonly tweets&lt;/a&gt;, “To those of you with low scores that wait for the FSD: don’t. Imagine if you drove the way the app requires, that would be horrible, right? But the car drives even worse! It’s seriously totally unusable in any sort of traffic and on narrow roads, the videos don’t do it justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RovYf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Similar to how I don't use stopping light control the current of iteration is something I'd want off outside of limited experiments, but unlike TL stopping mode you cannot turn off FSD annoyances!&lt;br&gt;(hopefully it improves, but knowing Tesla, that's long ways off)&lt;/p&gt;— green (@greentheonly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1448066775120293888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Tesla quietly raises prices on four of its EVs</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HIXAnv"&gt;Tesla quietly raised prices of four of its electric vehicles this weekend, a few days after the automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;announced a record $1.6 billion profit&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter. First reported by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/23/tesla-increases-model-s-model-x-prices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; the base Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles are each priced $2,000 higher, at $43,990 and $56,990 respectively. In addition, the base Model S and Model X vehicles will each cost $5,000 more, at $94,990 and  $104,990&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTvgrj"&gt;Tesla had a banner third quarter despite the global semiconductor shortage that has plagued other carmakers. Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464552/tesla-price-increases-supply-chain-pressure-chip-shortage-elon-musk"&gt;Elon Musk said in June&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla’s incremental price hikes on the Model 3 and Model Y during the first half of 2021 were due in large part to supply chain shortages. But the company was able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite its vehicle software&lt;/a&gt; so it could support alternate chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UP6QU8"&gt;Other automotive companies, including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-sees-global-chip-shortage-worsening-in-second-half-11625861486"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22619190/ford-mustang-mach-e-chip-shortage-delay-6-weeks-250kwh"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632330/toyota-production-japan-north-america-chip-shortage-ford-tesla-gm-vw"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have not been as fortunate, taking measures like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;increasing vehicle prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;temporarily shuttering factories&lt;/a&gt; to try to weather the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUDDl2"&gt;Tesla hasn’t offered an explanation for the latest price hikes, but company CFO Zach Kirkhorn said during its third quarter earnings call with investors that the increased demand for electric vehicles “caught us a little bit off guard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Quh2YC"&gt;“Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense,” Kirkhorn said. “But, you know, there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we’re balancing supply and demand, as we’re also trying to balance various shortages on parts, as we’re trying to manage wait times. All of that goes into the optimization here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qCjQQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 24th 2:04PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added more detailed quote from Tesla CFO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: King Richard, Uncharted, Ozark, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d16irDDCqUFRyyjs1fhfaUynvr8=/59x0:1345x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70038175/will_smith_in_king_richard.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Will Smith stars as Venus and Serena Williams’ father in King Richard | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIsNbpJIa6k&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures" target="_blank"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wh5VJq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; is back, thank goodness, and with it the awkward bravado of Kendall Roy, who would like his Twitter to be off the hook and whose plan to take over his family’s empire is essentially a series of hashtaggable platitudes. Still the squirmiest show on streaming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1l8BH"&gt;Here’s this week’s trailers roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ez3EW5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIsNbpJIa6k?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fQBY3D"&gt;King Richard &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2DKa43"&gt;Will Smith stars in &lt;em&gt;King Richard, &lt;/em&gt;the story of Serena and Venus Williams, told from the point of view of their father, whose determination (which is putting it mildly) helped drive his daughters to be the greatest tennis players of their generation. Smith’s performance in &lt;em&gt;King Richard,&lt;/em&gt; which debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in September, is already generating &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/awards/awards/king-richard-oscars-will-smith-1235056175/"&gt;Oscar buzz&lt;/a&gt; and honestly it’s not hard to see why from this second trailer. And yes, that is a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/10/beyonc-song-be-alive-king-richard-trailer.html"&gt;new Beyonce song&lt;/a&gt;. The Williams sisters are executive producers of &lt;em&gt;King Richard,&lt;/em&gt; which also stars Saniyya Sidney, Demi Singleton, Aunjanue Ellis, and Jon Bernthal. It comes to theaters and HBO Max on November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jfs4ej"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZOnOfc83Q0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cP6SCD"&gt;Uncharted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FdZfqv"&gt;Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie version of the adventures of Nathan Drake has been in development for more than a decade. Serving as a prequel to the game, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; finds Drake in search of Magellan’s treasure when he meets Victor “Sully” Sullivan. That cargo plane scene will look familiar to fans of the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 3&lt;/em&gt; game. Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas star in &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters (really!) on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2M7APg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNq9YOfL0Zs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lkBOam"&gt;The Lost Daughter &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IsIRG6"&gt;Olivia Colman plays a woman watching a young mother on vacation, but in a way that feels unsettling, almost stalker-y. When the younger woman’s daughter goes missing on the beach, we get the sense that there’s something not quite right about the older woman, and wonder who the lost daughter of the title might really be. Based on the novel by Elena Ferrante, &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is the directorial debut of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Along with Colman, Dakota Johnson, Ed Harris, Peter Sarsgaard, Jessie Buckley, and Paul Mescal star in &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Netflix December 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iuR9Ul"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1uFan_KgBw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dZIc39"&gt;The Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks1e8e"&gt;Catherine gets crowned at last, telling husband Peter that her title only seems arrogant “if you’re not great. If you are, it’s just calling things what they are.” Ah, there’s nothing quite like an 18th-century tale of intrigue and family dysfunction. Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult return in &lt;em&gt;The Great&lt;/em&gt; which has its second-season debut on  Hulu November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qXxqr3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61bYZ9Y0Nrs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2iRJtJ"&gt;Ozark &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zH1g5L"&gt;We finally have a date for the fourth and final season of &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt;, the story of the money-laundering Byrde family. We don’t get much else new in this teaser/trailer, but see Jason Bateman and Laura Linney walking through a gate with his voiceover saying “Today is a beginning.” &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt; returns to Netflix on January 21st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScHh6y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z362On"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMOE2B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Estimated ship times for preorders of new MacBook Pro models now into late November, early December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ship times for MacBook Pro models have slid into December&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMB2mj"&gt;Shipping estimates on the Apple Store for new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro pre-orders have started sliding into late November and early December. As of Sunday morning, estimates for the standard configurations of the 14-inch MacBook Pro were showing delivery dates between November 16th and 23rd. Customizing a 14-inch Pro could push the estimated delivery into mid-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NDwe3"&gt;For the 16-inch MacBook Pro, standard configurations are showing estimated shipping times between November 23rd and December 1st, with customized options also showing mid-December ship dates depending what you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCKQdWaWZ27b0qLunkAKIbQf1NU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22951561/Screen_Shot_2021_10_24_at_9.01.03_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Apple Online Store showing estimated shipping dates for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as of October 24th.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h-shipping-times-for-new-orders-continue-to-slip"&gt;Apple introduced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; MacBook Pro laptops at its “Unleashed” event on October 18th. The new design eliminates the Touch Bar in favor of a full-sized function row. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"&gt;added a notch&lt;/a&gt; to MacBook Pro screens for the first time, and brought back more port options, including an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, and a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

The new laptops will also have Apple’s adaptive refresh rate technology ProMotion, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini-LED&lt;/a&gt; 120Hz refresh displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9rVOk"&gt;The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, and the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sounds like the Halo Needler is finally getting the Nerf blaster it deserves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35MLQ0QPCFE0hQ0gZRL5aa94uMg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70036749/halo_needler_nerf_lmtd.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zoJAwQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;Needler is one of the most memorable video game weapons ever designed: an alien rifle that shoots homing spikes of crystalline plasma &lt;em&gt;that explode&lt;/em&gt;. While clearly taking some inspiration from &lt;a href="https://fifth-element.fandom.com/wiki/Zorg_ZF-1_Pod_Weapon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;’s “replay gun”&lt;/a&gt; in shape and functionality, it’s gained a following of its own. Now, Hasbro has announced a foam-firing Nerf replica of the Needler that might finally do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmzkHH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/collections/hasbro-pulsecon-2021/products/nerf-lmtd-halo-needler"&gt;The $100 Nerf LMTD Halo Needler&lt;/a&gt; follows the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627453/nerf-aliens-pulse-rifle-preorder-hasbro-gamestop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; Pulse Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;Amban Phase-pulse blaster&lt;/a&gt; in asking the question: what if Hasbro built a cosplay-grade Nerf blaster for its biggest fans instead of something that needs to sell like a toy? The answer is a 10-round fully automatic dart blaster with light-up spikes whose lights automatically wink out as you fire each dart, mimicking how each needle disappears when you play a &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;game. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XEDecgeik-WzMIyIL7IDWjAEqZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22950864/halo_needler_real_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;What the current prototype looks like lit up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZygKmr"&gt;It’s not a flywheel blaster, either, not the kind that spits out darts by flinging them between two wheels (and creating potentially annoying spin-up sounds). Just resting your finger on the trigger will turn on the Needler’s lights, and pulling it activates the full mechanism at once: a motor-driven series of gears that pulls a spring-loaded plunger back to fire and advance the drum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ynLTAalMruTFW-rGQ1UNaDtZM0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22950862/halo_needler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vmnnxf"&gt;That’s instantly &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than previous attempts at the Needler,&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO0WgM4MUh8"&gt; like the awkward BoomCo version&lt;/a&gt; that required an extra hand to prime a long, uncanonical handle at the bottom, or &lt;a href="https://nerf.hasbro.com/en-us/product/nerf-microshots-halo-needler-blaster:CDACEDC9-9F96-42D1-8C80-A7A55D0FE333"&gt;this quick earlier cash-in from Nerf.&lt;/a&gt; It takes 6 AA batteries, and for the substantial price you’ll also get a stand to display it. (You can leave the blaster lit up in display mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ax8xA"&gt;You can find it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HMWZ6F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.entertainmentearth.com%2Fproduct%2Fhalo-nerf-lmtd-needler-dartfiring-blaster%2Fhsf5487&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22742194%2Fhalo-needler-nerf-lmtd-announce-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Entertainment Earth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-games%2Fnerf%2Fproducts%2Fnerf-lmtd-halo-needler-blaster-with-light-up-needles%2F11168848.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/collections/hasbro-pulsecon-2021/products/nerf-lmtd-halo-needler"&gt;Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt;, but know it could take a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to arrive: it’s not due out till the end of 2022. It’s still in development, though Hasbro showed off an early working version &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3X-mHGlKAfE?t=8075"&gt;on its livestream today&lt;/a&gt; around the 2 hour, 14-minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reverses controversial .NET change after open source community outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hk9xo12dVBcAczTWIsrC-5ZOh0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70036382/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ZHY0b"&gt;Microsoft is reversing a decision to remove a key feature from its upcoming .NET 6 release, after a public outcry from the open source community. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740701/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-removal-decision-open-source"&gt;Microsoft angered the .NET open source community earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; by removing a key part of Hot Reload in the upcoming release of .NET 6, a feature that allows developers to modify source code while an app is running and immediately see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pO3xl"&gt;It’s a feature many had been looking forward to using in Visual Studio Code and across multiple platforms, until Microsoft made a controversial last-minute decision to lock it to Visual Studio 2022 which is a mostly paid product that’s limited to Windows. Sources at Microsoft, speaking on condition of anonymity&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the last-minute change was made by Julia Liuson, the head of Microsoft’s developer division, and was a business-focused move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p6IEjr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft admits it made a mistake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfMZjB"&gt;Microsoft has now reversed the change following a backlash, and anger inside the company from many of Microsoft’s own employees. “We made a mistake in executing on our decision and took longer than expected to respond back to the community,” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/"&gt;explains Scott Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, director of program management for .NET. Microsoft has now approved the community’s pull request to re-enable this feature and it will be available in the final version of the .NET 6 SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekGdO0"&gt;We asked Microsoft to comment on the fact an executive ordered the change, but the company didn’t want to discuss the controversial decision. “We have taken steps to address the issue that some of our OSS community members have experienced,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Hot Reload capability will be in the general availability build of the .NET 6 SDK available on November 8th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgkZw6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/"&gt;Microsoft’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t address this controversial decision, though. Instead, it suggests it was simply a mistake to remove the code instead of simply disabling it, and not a business decision. “In our effort to scope, we inadvertently ended up deleting the source code instead of just not invoking that code path,” says Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHSPA-agOEGe1VmM6llX-ehG8cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22950560/hotreload.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Reload lets developers instantly see code changes while apps are running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pGdaeY"&gt;While the reversal will be a welcome one for the .NET community, the explanation and circumstances around this incident won’t sit easy with those who value transparency around such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvCBcJ"&gt;“As is true with many companies, we are learning to balance the needs of OSS community and being a corporate sponsor for .NET,” says Hunter. “Sometimes we don’t get it right. When we don’t, the best we can do is learn from our mistakes and be better moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43O2xJ"&gt;This eventful episode came after &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/05/microsoft_net_foundation_under_fire/"&gt;weeks of unrest in the .NET community over Microsoft’s involvement in the .NET Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The foundation was created in 2014 when Microsoft made .NET open source, and it’s supposed to be an independent organization that exists to improve open source software development and collaboration for .NET. A resigning board member questioned the role of the .NET Foundation recently, asking whether it’s “here to enforce Microsoft’s will on .NET open source, or are you here to help foster and promote a healthy community?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liLzXJ"&gt;A recent controversy also led to .NET Foundation executive director Claire Novotny &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/11/dotnet_foundation_community_issues/"&gt;resigning recently&lt;/a&gt; and others &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/18/net_foundation_gnome/"&gt;questioning the independence&lt;/a&gt; of the .NET Foundation given Microsoft’s special privileges. Microsoft has certainly damaged some of the open source work it has been building on for 10 years with this u-turn, and the company still has plenty of work ahead to improve relations with the .NET community and the issues around its influence on the .NET Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse will soon let you pin links to the top of rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYC94pzSfnuH8QniERl2t5n3HVM=/0x0:9997x6665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035962/clubhouse1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G1Jcrr"&gt;Clubhouse is making it possible for people to share outside links and monetize their work on the platform. Today at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s On The Verge event, Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison and global head of marketing Maya Watson announced a new &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/introducing-pinned-links-so-many-new-ways-to-use-rooms/"&gt;pinned links&lt;/a&gt; feature, which allows moderators to place outside links at the top of a room. These links can direct listeners to whatever moderators want, like a Patreon page, a news article, or a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2tA7M"&gt;Certain links won’t be allowed for security and moderation reasons. Davison didn’t explicitly name the types of links that &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t &lt;/em&gt;be allowed, but he suggested links to OnlyFans wouldn’t be accepted because links to porn are banned. Anyone can add, change, or remove a link, so long as they’re a moderator of a room and regardless of the number of followers they have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSD72e"&gt;The feature rolls out October 27th for both iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
