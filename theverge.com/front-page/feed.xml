    <title>Facebook acquires the developers of VR military simulator Onward</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0_S_XLwQ_g7_WSofbyrC69bDIg=/101x0:1190x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215417/_joK6MdQ.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Onward&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Downpour Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OiAynm"&gt;Facebook’s Oculus division has snatched up yet another popular virtual reality game developer. On Friday, the company announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it has acquired Downpour Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind the hit multiplayer military simulator &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbdHpD"&gt;“We’ve seen great success with &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; on the Oculus platform for several years — first on Rift and more recently on Quest,” Mike Verdu, Facebook’s VP of AR / VR content, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Becoming part of the Oculus Studios family will give Downpour Interactive the opportunity to cultivate both the &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; community with the full support of Oculus Studios resources, and, in the future, pursue other projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Il5KQb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everyone from Downpour will move to Oculus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQPsS"&gt;Everyone from Downpour Interactive will move over to the Oculus Studios team “in some capacity,” Verdu said. He also confirmed that Onward will still be supported on all of the platforms where it’s currently available: the Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, and Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10Duxn"&gt;Dante Buckley, founder and CEO of Downpour Interactive, said in an &lt;a href="https://www.downpourinteractive.com/"&gt;FAQ on the studio’s website&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Onward’s&lt;/em&gt; feature roadmap “remains unchanged” and that the studio plans to “accelerate the speed of our development” because of the acquisition. Downpour Interactive will also continue to retain “full control of all development,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p65A6P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are excited to announce that Downpour Interactive is joining Oculus Studios. We know you have questions and we have built an FAQ to help answer them. For more details, including a message from our founder Dante, visit our website at &lt;a href="https://t.co/fJCke9C8R5"&gt;https://t.co/fJCke9C8R5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Kub7kfpVc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Kub7kfpVc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Downpour Interactive (@DownpourInt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DownpourInt/status/1388225400078221313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SbbGpc"&gt;The acquisition is Facebook’s latest to beef up Oculus Studios. The company bought &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; developer Beat Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20984468/facebook-acquisition-beat-games-beat-saber-vr-studio"&gt;in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Asgard’s Wrath&lt;/em&gt; maker Sanzaru Games &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-sanzaru-games-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lone Echo&lt;/em&gt; creator Ready at Dawn &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-ready-at-dawn-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA suspends SpaceX’s $2.9 billion moon lander contract after rivals protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yubuqrvBWN08D_C6Xb-GjnmbNwk=/154x0:985x554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215254/for_press_release.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital illustration of SpaceX’s Starship lunar lander sitting on the Moon’s surface, as proposed to NASA under its Artemis program.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="67JSBP"&gt;NASA has suspended work on SpaceX’s new $2.9 billion lunar lander contract while a federal watchdog agency adjudicates two protests over the award, the agency said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28bTex"&gt;Putting the Human Landing System (or HLS) work on hold until the GAO makes a decision on the two protests means SpaceX won’t immediately receive its first chunk of the $2.9 billion award, nor will it commence the initial talks with NASA that would normally take place at the onset of a major contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40B7Zs"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt; by NASA on April 16th to build the agency’s first human lunar lander since the Apollo program, as the agency opted to rely on just one company for a high-profile contract that many in the space industry expected to go to two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HhY2M"&gt;As a result, two companies that were in the running for the contract, Blue Origin and Dynetics, protested NASA’s decision to the Government Accountability Office, which adjudicates bidding disputes. Blue Origin alleges the agency unfairly “moved the goalposts at the last minute” and endangered NASA’s speedy 2024 timeline by only picking SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sA6duQ"&gt;“Pursuant to the GAO protests, NASA instructed SpaceX that progress on the HLS contract has been suspended until GAO resolves all outstanding litigation related to this procurement,” NASA spokeswoman Monica Witt said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmwJHe"&gt;Starship, SpaceX’s fully reusable rocket system under development to eventually ferry humans and cargo to the Moon and Mars, won NASA’s award mainly for its massive cargo capability and its proposed bid of $2.9 billion — far cheaper than Blue Origin’s and Dynetics’, according to a NASA source selection document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gloui"&gt;Starship’s development to this point has been driven primarily by Musk, SpaceX’s billionaire founder and chief executive. The company has launched several Starship prototypes in short- and high-altitude test flights at its Boca Chica, Texas, launch facilities. Landing the prototypes after soaring over six miles in the air has proved to be a formidable challenge — all of SpaceX’s high-altitude prototype rockets have been destroyed in landing-phase explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlXjci"&gt;SpaceX’s private Starship development will likely continue. The company’s most recent test of a Starship prototype, SN15, is slated to launch within the next few days after clinching license approval from the Federal Aviation Administration this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEnUzS"&gt;NASA has said picking one company was the best decision it could make at the time with the funds made available from Congress. Last year, Congress gave the agency $850 million of the $3.3 billion it requested to procure two lunar landers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCwXjE"&gt;SpaceX’s award was a key “first step” in a broader program to secure transportation to the Moon, NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders said at the time, promising that new contract opportunities will open up in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMIzur"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMVks7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal COVID-19 vaccine website launches with Spanish-language version </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Healthcare Workers Administer Covid-19 Vaccines At American Museum of Natural History" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iiXWAKoiaPO3IL8k6vtflQOk2Ms=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214991/1232612380.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFi9VB"&gt;The Biden administration’s version of a COVID-19 vaccine-finding website launched today, along with a Spanish-language version, text messaging tool, and phone hotline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TaBS0"&gt;The new website, &lt;a href="http://vaccines.gov"&gt;vaccines.gov&lt;/a&gt;, is a new version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337754/covid-vaccine-availability-website-vaccinefinder-biden"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, a site run through a partnership between Boston Children’s Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. VaccineFinder was originally created during the 2009 swine flu outbreaks and has hosted COVID-19 vaccine information for the past few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx4g6w"&gt;The new version has the same features as the old site. It lets people locate sites offering COVID-19 vaccines nearby, shows which vaccines are on offer at each location, and says if the vaccines are in stock or not. “In stock” does not necessarily mean there are appointments available, just that the site has shots on hand. People cannot make appointments directly through &lt;a href="http://Vaccines.gov"&gt;vaccines.gov&lt;/a&gt; — the website directs them to the vaccination site’s registration system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0jmR7"&gt;There is now also a Spanish-language version of the site, found at &lt;a href="https://www.vacunas.gov/"&gt;vacunas.gov&lt;/a&gt;. There are few COVID-19 vaccination resources available for people in the US who do not speak English. Limited access to non-English vaccine information is the subject of a new federal civil rights complaint filed by the National Health Law Program. In 11 states, health departments have no non-English information available on their websites, a &lt;em&gt;Type Investigations&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2021/04/30/covid-language-access-lep/"&gt;report found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgnfMu"&gt;Along with the website, the Biden administration is launching a text messaging tool and phone line to connect people with vaccination sites. The phone line will be promoted in rural areas without reliable internet, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/biden-team-launches-website-text-messages-to-locate-vaccines"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Older adults and other groups not comfortable using the internet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for vaccination appointments early on in the US vaccine campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkOWTk"&gt;The rate of COVID-19 vaccinations in the US is starting to slow now that most people who were eager to get vaccinated have already received shots. The next step is reaching people who aren’t going to actively seek out a shot, or who may have questions about it. Over 100 million people in the US are &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;fully vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, as of April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro? You may have to wait until July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhrRuUTDaqBkWS4_drkuoi_XzPU=/312x0:2000x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214967/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g58tOJ"&gt;If you’re hoping to get one of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with a Mini LED display, you may be waiting a while — the delivery times for even &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the base model&lt;/a&gt; have slipped to late June or early July (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/apple-s-new-high-end-ipad-pros-see-delivery-times-slip-to-july"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Leading up to the device’s announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;there were rumors&lt;/a&gt; that the display tech could be a production bottleneck for Apple, and that appears to be the case — Apple’s site says &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F11-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the 11-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, announced alongside the 12.9-inch, would be delivered in late May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOuBkf"&gt;The Mini LED display that could be to blame for the short supply of iPads is a new tech for Apple, but it promises to bring a ton of improvements compared to normal LED displays. However, they’re trickier to produce — Apple says that the previous iPad Pro’s display had 72 LEDs, while the Mini LED version boasts over 10,000. For a more in-depth look at the tech, we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;an explainer here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-7-core-gpu-256gb%23"&gt;lower-end iMac&lt;/a&gt; will arrive in late May, though the &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23"&gt;higher-end versions&lt;/a&gt; won’t get to you until early June — the same as the new Siri Remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Au8nJF"&gt;Interestingly, while &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag%2F1-pack"&gt;a single AirTag&lt;/a&gt; seems readily available, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag%2F4-pack"&gt;the four-pack&lt;/a&gt; is a bit harder to come by — Apple’s site has them delivering in June, while &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirTag-4-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the pack listed&lt;/a&gt; as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acing its fourth flight on Mars, NASA’s Ingenuity will advance to a new testing round  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8kkmAKCo0ltSFbiLlM2m4XeOen0=/0x4:1580x1057/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214965/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0068_0672974790_421ECM_N0032208ZCAM05029_110085J.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0M0CfP"&gt;After acing a set of historic test flights on Mars, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter will embark on a new, more advanced test mission, engineers said today. Having proved itself capable of flying higher and farther with its fourth flight on Friday, the mini helicopter will get ready to demonstrate how it could help Mars rovers, like Perseverance, scout for new locations and probe areas inaccessible to wheeled robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbWMG4"&gt;Ingenuity, which became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;the first helicopter to fly on another world&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, was initially set to retire forever when its flight demonstration phase ends next week, after completing five flights. But the team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory okayed another round of testing because Perseverance’s post-landing health checks are ahead of schedule — and Ingenuity isn’t ready to put its twin carbon fiber rotor blades to rest yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhk4Fk"&gt;For the first (and current) test phase, the four-pound helicopter proved it’s possible to achieve powered lift in the thin Martian atmosphere, opening up a new mode of transportation for planetary exploration. The next test phase will be slightly different, and more ambitious, than the first: Ingenuity will observe specific science targets on Mars, scout for interesting locations for Perseverance, and look for new potential flight zones for future flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hPbN1"&gt;“The lessons learned from that exercise will benefit future missions with aerial platforms tremendously,” said MiMi Aung, the helicopter’s project manager, adding that the craft’s test capabilities will be pushed with each flight. This phase will only contain one or two flights, spaced further apart. But engineers signaled more could be planned depending on the helicopter’s performance. And Perseverance, acting as Ingenuity’s comms mothership from a distance of a few hundred feet, won’t use its onboard cameras to take photos of the helicopter, as it’s doing for the first phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYbptM"&gt;Since deploying from the belly of Perseverance on April 4th, Ingenuity has nailed four flight tests so far, each with increasing complexity: The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;first flight&lt;/a&gt; was a 40-second hover 10 feet above the ground, and its third flight rose 16 feet, then zipped 164 feet across its flight zone at about 4.5 miles per hour. Ingenuity made its fourth flight on Friday, and engineers are currently analyzing troves of data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An initial image taken by Perseverance’s Hazcam shows Ingenuity, appearing as a small speck in the upper-middle-right part of the frame, flying its fourth flight test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m3eEOz"&gt;Perseverance landed on Mars with Ingenuity on February 18th. The rover’s primary mission is to hunt for signs of fossilized life and pack soil samples into cigar-sized tubes to leave scattered around the Martian surface. A future “fetch” rover will retrieve those tubes sometime in the next decade or so. The recent decision to collect those soil samples near Ingenuity’s flight zone helped NASA make the call to keep Ingenuity in service — suddenly, having Perseverance stick around to keep tabs on the helicopter’s health became possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5WLx8"&gt;Ingenuity’s fourth test flight demonstrated farther and faster travel, and served as a scout mission for the flight zone it’ll use for its next testing phase. Its fifth flight, scheduled to take place in the coming days, will be a one-way trip to that new location. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Basecamp implodes as employees flee company, including senior staff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZLm_mGAkyY8ErX3pKUIEZ1WVgg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214523/acastro_210427_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rsb258"&gt;After a controversial blog post in which &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;CEO Jason Fried outlined Basecamp’s new philosophy&lt;/a&gt; that prohibited, among other things, “societal and political discussions” on internal forums, company co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson said the company would offer generous severance packages to anyone who disagreed with the new stance. On Friday, it appears a large number of Basecamp employees are taking Hansson up on his offer: according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;contributing editor Casey Newton’s sources, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1388212468510380034?s=20"&gt;roughly a third&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s 57 employees accepted buyouts today. As of Friday afternoon, 18 people had tweeted they were planning to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imvU5z"&gt;Not long after Fried’s Monday blog post went public — and was revised several times amid public backlash online — Hansson outlined the terms of the new severance offer &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e"&gt;in a separate Wednesday blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="fCHjvm"&gt;Yesterday, we offered everyone at Basecamp an option of a severance package worth up to six months salary for those who’ve been with the company over three years, and three months salary for those at the company less than that. No hard feelings, no questions asked. For those who cannot see a future at Basecamp under this new direction, we’ll help them in every which way we can to land somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LzeYE9"&gt;Among those who announced on Twitter they’re leaving the company are reportedly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ThatDetroitAndy/status/1388195273336401920?s=20"&gt;head of marketing Andy Didorosi&lt;/a&gt;, head of design &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1388205182916440070?s=20"&gt;Jonas Downey&lt;/a&gt;, and head of customer support &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kikiaards/status/1388208900608954371?s=20"&gt;Kristin Aardsma&lt;/a&gt;. Most cited “recent changes” at the company as their reason for leaving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swCiZ4"&gt;“Given the recent changes at Basecamp, I’ve decided to leave my job as Head of Design,” Downey tweeted. “I’ve helped design &amp;amp; build all of our products since 2011, and recently I’ve been leading our design team too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yqhXIP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I resigned today from my role as Head of Marketing at Basecamp due to recent changes and new policies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll be returning to entrepreneurship.

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;After nearly 8 years, given the recent changes at Basecamp, I’ve decided to leave my job as an Android programmer there. Will eventually be looking for something new, so please feel free to reach out / RT. DMs open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you all for your support and kindness. It means a lot. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Kim (@dankim) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dankim/status/1388210746585198596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RMdmo5"&gt;Software developer John Breen is tracking additional Basecamp departures &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_breeeeen_/status/1388198260603506693?s=20"&gt;in this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmuCEA"&gt;The original blog post that started the brouhaha at the tiny company with an outsized voice also detailed how Basecamp would do away with “paternalistic benefits,” committees, and would prohibit “lingering or dwelling on past decisions.” But it was the “societal and political discussions” item that stirred up the most reaction: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HFRQ9e"&gt;Today’s social and political waters are especially choppy. Sensitivities are at 11, and every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy, or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant. You shouldn’t have to wonder if staying out of it means you’re complicit, or wading into it means you’re a target. These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work. It’s become too much. It’s a major distraction. It saps our energy, and redirects our dialog towards dark places. It’s not healthy, it hasn’t served us well. And we’re done with it on our company Basecamp account where the work happens. People can take the conversations with willing co-workers to Signal, Whatsapp, or even a personal Basecamp account, but it can’t happen where the work happens anymore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ18j0"&gt;While the company argued that it was just trying to get its own employees focused on work, company founders don’t tend to shy away from “societal and political discussions” online, with Hansson in particular having become a vocal critic of Apple’s App Store policies, to the point that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276511/north-dakota-senate-bill-2333-apple-google-app-store-antitrust-monopoly"&gt;he has testified&lt;/a&gt; in favor of antitrust regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d104Vi"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; later reported&lt;/a&gt;, the initial motivation for the letter stemmed from internal disagreement over a controversial list of “funny names” of Basecamp customers. Several of the names on the list, which resurfaced several times over the years and of which management was well aware, were of Asian or African origin. Employees considered their inclusion inappropriate at best, and racist at worst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OchrrX"&gt;Hansson acknowledged the list and tried to move on (you can read his internal communications &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but employees pressed the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9hLZE"&gt;Hansson did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge o&lt;/em&gt;n Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku and YouTube TV are now in an all-out public showdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSjC9gG1SOL_DAaI5AM39i2UlfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214294/acastro_180806_1777_youtube_cancel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4K8qRf"&gt;On Friday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;Roku pulled YouTube TV from its channel store&lt;/a&gt;. Its removal came after Roku’s distribution agreement for the app expired and negotiations between it and Google fell apart without any new deal in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gole8M"&gt;The popular streaming hardware maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403740/roku-youtube-tv-google-standoff-competition-negotiations-contract"&gt;warned customers of this outcome&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the week, claiming that Google was demanding unrealistic terms to renew YouTube TV’s slot on the platform. Those asks, according to Roku, included access to sensitive customer data and an apparent commitment from Roku to support AV1 decoding in future products. That requires extra hardware that Roku maintains could increase the cost of its devices. Roku also says that Google is trying to have changes made to Roku’s search feature, an assertion that Google has strongly denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJOHay"&gt;The war of words has quickly gotten intense, with Roku noting the antitrust investigations that Google currently faces and framing this standoff as another example of the company wielding its “monopoly position.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIfay8"&gt;On the other side, Google has pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;Roku’s recent spats with HBO Max, Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, and others as a clear, growing trend of Roku abusing its huge market share and influential presence in the living room. “Roku terminated our deal in bad faith amidst our negotiation,” the company said on its YouTube TV blog. “Unfortunately, Roku has often engaged in this tactic with other streaming providers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx00vX"&gt;The back-and-forth is reminiscent of the carriage disputes that regularly happen between cable companies and TV network owners. But this is a much more 2021 version, and Roku is squaring off with a tech giant that doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPFv9L"&gt;Here’s a rundown of how the relationship between the two companies quickly spiraled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EGL21X"&gt;Roku and YouTube TV dispute timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kWAH2L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 26th:&lt;/strong&gt; Roku sends an email to customers, explaining that it might soon have to remove YouTube TV. “Recent negotiations with Google to carry YouTube TV have broken down because Roku cannot accept Google’s unfair terms as we believe they could harm our users,” the company says. At the end of the email, Roku tells frustrated customers they should urge Google to make a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pwQO5"&gt;Google responds soon after, saying, “We’re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7PlNe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30th, 8:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; YouTube TV is removed from the Roku channel store. Those who have already installed the app on a Roku device can continue using it, but new downloads are no longer possible. Subscriptions from within the YouTube TV app are also disabled. Roku sends another email to customers about the situation and urges them not to delete the YouTube TV app if they already have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6I49N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30th 11:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Google strikes back at Roku &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-our-youtube-tv-members-roku/"&gt;with a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that accuses the company of underhanded negotiation tactics. “Our initial conversations started with Roku simply to renew the current terms of their ongoing deal with YouTube TV, which has been in place for several years. Our offer to Roku was simple and still stands: renew the YouTube TV deal under the existing reasonable terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QzaKBe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An update for our members: Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to reach an agreement with Roku. We continue to offer Roku the opportunity to renew the YouTube TV deal under the existing reasonable terms.&lt;/p&gt;— YouTube TV (@YouTubeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV/status/1388173153843572737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X8pRXh"&gt;Google criticizes Roku for unnecessarily bringing the flagship YouTube app into negotiation talks; the deal for that app doesn’t expire until December. But Google tacitly acknowledges it’s pushing Roku to adopt the AV1 codec, saying, “Our agreements with partners have technical requirements to ensure a high quality experience on YouTube.” The company again denies it has asked Roku for exclusive customer data or to change its search feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F79PoC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 30th 1:19PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Google tries to rally YouTube TV customers into its dispute with Roku. In an afternoon email, customers are encouraged to tweet at Roku and contact the company in other ways to voice their support for YouTube TV staying on the platform. Google reminds customers of fallback methods for viewing YouTube TV, including casting and using other streaming devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wD2I96"&gt;What are Roku and Google fighting over?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sJXTQG"&gt;Roku claims that Google is making demands on several fronts. It’s accusing the company of trying to muck with its search results, strong-arming Roku into supporting AV1, and asking for a deeper layer of customer data that other streaming apps don’t have access to. “We simply cannot agree to terms that would manipulate consumer search results, inflate the cost of our products, and violate established industry data practices,” Roku said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GxWIH"&gt;Google has flatly denied trying to interfere with search or demanding a special view into customer data. Its statements portray Roku as a bully in streaming hardware that’s angling for “special treatment” that other YouTube partners don’t receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanGJy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol’s&lt;/em&gt; Janko Roettgers &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/youtube-tv-roku-issues"&gt;covers the AV1 codec situation nicely&lt;/a&gt; here. Google has been pushing Android TV device makers and smart TV manufacturers to build in support for AV1 decoding. YouTube is a hugely popular app, so Google has quite the bargaining chip. AV1 is a more efficient codec for high-resolution video streaming in 4K HDR and 8K, but it requires hardware for decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAX6nI"&gt;The bit of irony in all this is that Google’s own $50 Chromecast with Google TV does not currently include hardware-based AV1 decoding. So Roku is upset Google wants it to “accept hardware requirements that would increase consumer costs.” Roku’s cheapest streaming players still undercut the Chromecast by as much as $30. If the price of those goes up, Roku loses a key advantage over the competition. But there’s no denying that these disputes between Roku and content providers are becoming more frequent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOrOj5"&gt;We’ll have to see how long this feud continues on for. For the sake of paying YouTube TV subscribers, hopefully it won’t stretch out too far. But based on today’s comments, it seems like the rift between Roku and Google is only growing deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart shoppers say their accounts were wrongly deactivated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FgVPbtBg1L7Qd68RFzCHgkZhm0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213953/instacart_shopper_produce.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YURJhx"&gt;Some Instacart shoppers claim that the company has wrongfully terminated their accounts in response to fraudulent activity, locking them out of future earnings until they get reactivated, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/30/tech/instacart-deactivations/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xq8mB5"&gt;The shoppers &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; spoke to were identified as having “linked accounts,” which, in Instacart’s terminology, means an account believed to have indicators of fraud, though not necessarily with compromised data connected to a shopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z4Hh8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shoppers may be the victims of phishing scams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N6dclF"&gt;The company offers a process for appealing deactivations, but at least one of the shoppers &lt;em&gt;CNN Business&lt;/em&gt; spoke to, Rachael Freedman, still hasn’t had her account reactivated because her appeal was denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwtcL3"&gt;Instacart provided the same statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it offered to &lt;em&gt;CNN Business:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MpPXv5"&gt;We take the safety and security of the Instacart platform very seriously. There has not been a breach or hack of the Instacart platform. To ensure the safest possible experience for all members of the Instacart community, our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team is dedicated to ongoing security measures to eliminate any instances of fraudulent activity on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z6ewus"&gt;The company says it has multiple measures in place for shoppers to get back into their accounts if they’ve been the victim of a phishing or other unauthorized access. It’s not clear why that hasn’t applied to Freedman. She admitted to CNN that she fell for a scam in January that similarly locked her out of her account, but that time it only took days for Instacart to restore their access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4N3RE"&gt;The scam that Instacart workers describe sounds similar to an issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409937/scammers-hack-target-gig-workers-drain-bank-accounts"&gt;Target’s Shipt gig workers&lt;/a&gt; encountered. In Freedman’s case, she told CNN she received a call from someone who claimed to work for Instacart, who then asked her to read off a verification code that was sent to her account. Not long after she shared her information, she was locked out. It appears the scammer changed the password to her account — again, very similar to what Shipt shoppers described, except in her case, Instacart initially responded by deactivating Freedman’s account completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baSyL1"&gt;The same thing happened to another shopper from Virginia, Rebecca Maynard. Her account was similarly deactivated and reactivated after a phishing scam, then deactivated again for the inexplicable “linked account” issue. CNN says her appeal was mysteriously denied as well. Ruth Wallace, a shopper in Michigan, did have her appeal approved, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zuW3uv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The human cost of Instacart’s grocery delivery","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21267669/instacart-shoppers-sick-extended-pay-quarantine-leave-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="k5jkbY"&gt;The pandemic has made grocery delivery a crucial service, but the ease with which workers can have their income affected illustrates how vulnerable gig workers like Instacart shoppers are. In addition to working on the front lines during a pandemic, last year, Instacart shoppers reportedly had to deal with some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216317/instacart-tip-baiting-grocery-employees-delivery-pandemic"&gt;customers baiting larger orders with even larger tips&lt;/a&gt;, only to have those tips shrink upon delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpFjwT"&gt;Gig workers like Instacart shoppers typically lack the job stability and workplace protections that full-time employees enjoy.  At least one Biden administration official has said it’s time to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/29/22409952/labor-secretary-gig-workers-uber-lyft-employees-contractors"&gt;reclassify gig workers as employees&lt;/a&gt;, which would alleviate some of the uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKjGMU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 30th, 5:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Instacart. Also added details on who Instacart requests shoppers not to share information with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your paycheck is missing, QuickBooks may be to blame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="(Flickr) American money" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in0aLzCo3GUo-oekdyrUkRJWom0=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213746/4603130687_d0a0862bc4_b.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckgTym"&gt;Due to an issue with QuickBooks processing direct deposits, some people had a very unpleasant morning, waking up to see either that their paycheck hadn’t arrived, or that they had a ton of employees asking why they hadn’t been paid. If you’re one of those people, it may not be time to panic just yet — &lt;a href="http://status.quickbooks.intuit.com/incidents/jnhwslhtskgd"&gt;QuickBooks says&lt;/a&gt; that the issue has been resolved and that the money &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks/status/1388174723079495685?s=20"&gt;should be arriving in accounts&lt;/a&gt; by the end of today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3h1TZ"&gt;QuickBooks claims the missed payments were caused by an issue with a third party. Some users, though, are upset with how Intuit, which owns QuickBooks, handled the situation, claiming that they couldn’t get a hold of the company on their phone or chat lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y4WL4T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What the heck &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt;. My employees need to get paid. Fix your stuff ASAP. Nobody is answering the phones or helping in the chat. Been on hold for 2 hours now.&lt;/p&gt;— Ashwin Chary (@CharyAshwin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CharyAshwin/status/1388135526155292677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ikVt2T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt; I almost got fired by my boss because he thinks I forgot to run payroll. Fun way to wake up. At least update your phone lines and websites to let us know it’s a known issue. I waited 30 minutes before I thought “let me see what’s trending on Twitter”.&lt;/p&gt;— Michael (@CardinalMike08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CardinalMike08/status/1388129602917306368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="d6LBLS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/QuickBooks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@QuickBooks&lt;/a&gt; been on hold for almost three hours. My employees didn’t get their direct deposit. You can at least give your clients an update! &lt;a href="https://t.co/tVYvEYpahK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tVYvEYpahK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fabby Escamilla (@MrsJCEseo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrsJCEseo/status/1388163523105132548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2tODA"&gt;QuickBooks told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s working on communicating with “impacted customers,” but it’s definitely not the type of situation you want to deal with on a Friday morning, especially one on the 30th — if you’re an employee, you probably have a bunch of bills coming due, and if you’re an employer, you probably don’t want all your workers mad at you because of a computer glitch that’s not your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlRqdj"&gt;If you’ve been impacted and still haven’t seen payment by the end of the day, you can let &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; know by emailing tips@theverge.com.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: iOS 14.5 features, Apple sales skyrocket, and podcasting </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/49IftTcv4YejD0OvTXvVkauQc2U=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69213471/fbpodcasts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sFXTBx"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where host Nilay Patel discusses the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2IYZK"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay brings in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Dan Seifert and news editor Chaim Gartenberg to discuss the features added in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s iOS update to 14.5&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and other tech companies’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;skyrocketing&lt;/a&gt; earnings despite the ongoing pandemic, and how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; is affecting the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFFObc"&gt;Later in the show, senior reporter Ashley Carman runs through the recent developments in podcasting platforms. At an event last week, Apple announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscription feature within Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; for creators to offer to their listeners. Ashley discusses the audio product developments announced this week from competitor companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403617/facebook-podcast-player-release-in-app-pages"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403852/siriusxm-roman-mars-99-percent-invisible-acquire-stitcher"&gt;SiriusXM&lt;/a&gt;, and what this may mean for podcast creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zmxql9"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5942362223&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EbKZDJ"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in between all of that — like Samsung’s newly announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;Galaxy Book Pros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405894/epic-apple-store-fortnite-trial-kickoff-witnesses-list"&gt;upcoming trial between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt; — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;
