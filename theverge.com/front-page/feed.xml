    <title>Asus updates its overkill gaming phones with Qualcomm’s new overkill processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Rzppsh87OfdfCkOC3FJDdPovzE=/0x0:1145x763/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740485/msedge_5BtFPuHiJl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro has a small display on its rear.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jQXU7w"&gt;When you’re selling high-spec gaming-focused phones, it makes sense to have the most powerful processor possible. At least, that’s the only explanation I can come up with for why Asus would announce its new Snapdragon 888 Plus-powered ROG Phone 5S lineup, just months after releasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;the original ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnwlOA"&gt;There are two new S-branded phones, the &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/phones/rog-phone-5s-model/"&gt;ROG Phone 5S&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/phones/rog-phone-5s-pro-model/"&gt;ROG Phone 5S Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, more responsive 360Hz touch-sampling rate, and increased &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Ftw%2FMobile%2FPhones%2FROG-Phone%2Ffilter%3FSeries%3DROG-Phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F18%2F22630283%2Fasus-rog-phone-5s-pro-gaming-smartphone-android-price-release-date-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;maximums of 18GB RAM and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, the 5S appears to be &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/compareresult?productline=phones&amp;amp;webpathname=ROG-Phone-5s,ROG-Phone-5&amp;amp;id=130291,120644"&gt;a very similar device to the ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt;. That means it’s also got a 6.78-inch 144Hz display, 6,000 mAh battery, and triple rear cameras with a 64-megapixel main sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xOQSRu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Both feature more responsive displays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U1uY3d"&gt;The ROG Phone 5S Pro is a similar upgrade. It’s also been bumped up to the 888 Plus, has the same faster touch-sampling rate, and up to 18GB of RAM. Otherwise this is a very similar gaming-focused phone to the 5 Pro, complete with neat additions like extra touch sensors on its back and side to offer more controls while gaming. Check out our review of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year for an idea of how these features work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhIeyg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/08/16/asus-rog-phone-5s-5s-pro-launched-18gb-ram-snapdragon-888-plus/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Gizmochina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the two new phones are only available to order in the Taiwanese market for now, where they’ll ship next week on August 24th. The Asus ROG Phone 5S starts at NT$ 29,990 (around $991), while the 5S Pro starts at NT$ 37,990 (around $1,364). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fuchsia OS is rolling out to every first-gen Nest Hub</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKbPE1HHVX8HLdD06p_qmdP96j0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69740371/dseifert_181018_3039_1192.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbstyr"&gt;Google has started to push out the silent upgrade to its new Fuchsia operating system on first-gen Nest Hub devices (known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;the Google Home Hub on release&lt;/a&gt;), meaning the secretive project will be broadly used by consumers after years of opaque development. The OS, which unlike Android isn’t based on Linux and uses a microkernel called Zircon, was previously made available to some devices enrolled in a preview program back in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mT1EX"&gt;Now, Google has &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/google-fuchsia-update-rolling-out-widely-nest-hub/"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a new firmware update for non-preview Nest Hub devices includes the Fuchsia upgrade, meaning that all first-gen devices should be running Fuschia already or very soon. I just checked the one on my desk — which Google explains how to do &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7365257?hl=en"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; — and sure enough, turns out it’s on Fuchsia right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="08we3O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is still making its mysterious Fuchsia OS, and now it wants your help","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163225/google-fuchsia-os-call-contributors-mailing-list-governance"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Qq4LLI"&gt;You might’ve thought I’d have noticed that a device that I look at and interact with every day is running an entirely new operating system, but Google is attempting to make the experience as close to identical as possible. Even the pokey performance on the first-gen Nest Hub appears to be very similar, for better or worse. The only way to know you have Fuchsia is by checking the “About device” section of the settings menu, and even then the OS isn’t mentioned by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gOBEx"&gt;That means that the first widespread Fuchsia deployment isn’t quite as exciting as the possibilities imagined when word of the project first started getting out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/15/12480566/google-fuchsia-new-operating-system"&gt;more than five years ago&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, it’s quite impressive that Google has managed to seamlessly replace the core software of a popular product in a way that most people won’t ever notice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Say goodbye to Intel’s RealSense tech by remembering its incredible demos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel-Project-Euclid-Robot-RealSense-Module-2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coDfxM4UygNib8NrcgWCJ22C51Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738886/verge-2017-08-17_14-32-52.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fPtQIQ"&gt;Intel’s RealSense computer vision tech will soon be going away, as the company is “winding down” the business, &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-shuttering-realsense-camera-business?itc=refresh"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CRN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t remember the tech from January of this year, where Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217480/intel-realsense-id-facial-recognition-encrypted-camera-depth-sensing"&gt;pitched it as a way to create facial recognition systems&lt;/a&gt;, you may remember it from some incredible tech demos (or possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/8/8366421/dell-venue-10-7000-tablet-video-specs-price"&gt;a few devices&lt;/a&gt;, if you were really paying attention).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Duinal"&gt;Now that the tech is on its way out, perhaps it’s a good time to look back at some of the cool ways we’ve seen it shown off to remember the good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B4tBOs"&gt;CES 2013 — Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/7/3848012/intel-nuance-voice-face-interface"&gt;talks about&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3851368/we-try-intels-perceptual-computing-play-portal-2-with-a-wave-of-the"&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt;, what it calls “perceptual computing.” The company pitches its tech as a way to interact with your computer by moving and talking, and the next year...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rO2R7V"&gt;CES 2014 — Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281120/kinect-like-cameras-are-coming-to-your-next-laptop-or-tablet"&gt;announces its RealSense 3D cameras&lt;/a&gt;, which it says will bring Kinect-like motion tracking to laptops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SFQliu"&gt;CES 2015 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7505803/intel-realsense-technology-can-make-every-device-self-aware"&gt;Intel shows off&lt;/a&gt; a self-flying drone and a jacket that’s aware of the wearer’s surroundings, powered by RealSense. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wubDIa"&gt;CES 2016 — We see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10717406/intel-ionvr-vr-headset-realsense-smartphone-developer-kit-ces-2016"&gt;a preview of a VR headset&lt;/a&gt; that uses RealSense to map the wearer’s real-life environment, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724564/yuneec-typhoon-h-drone-intel-photos-video-ces-2016"&gt;a drone that uses the tech for obstacle avoidance&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Intel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/6/10724248/fallout-4-mod-uraniom-face-intel-realsense-ces-2016"&gt;puts Dieter into &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using a RealSense scan of his face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aI9aaX"&gt;August 2016 — Intel announces a RealSense module that’s designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/16/12504678/intel-project-euclid-robots-realsense-module-tiny-computer"&gt;give robots the ability to “sense.”&lt;/a&gt; The company also introduces a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12503948/intel-project-allow-vr-headset-cordless-mixed-reality"&gt;wireless VR headset called Project Alloy&lt;/a&gt; that it says will blend real and virtual worlds with help from RealSense motion tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="P4rbJU"&gt;November 2016 — Intel lets &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/18/13673084/intel-microsoft-project-alloy-vr-headset-first-look-mixed-merged-reality"&gt;try Project Alloy’s “merged reality” headset&lt;/a&gt;, which uses RealSense. At CES 2017 it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/8/14202270/intel-project-alloy-vr-merged-reality-headset-update-ces-2017"&gt;demos a third generation of the headset&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/22/16351900/intel-project-alloy-vr-merged-reality-headset-reference-design-discontinued"&gt;“wind[s] down” the project later that year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TXvzSu"&gt;CES 2021 — Intel announces &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/turn-touch-interface-touchless-realsense-tcs.html#gs.q0dzl7"&gt;RealSense Touchless Control Software&lt;/a&gt;, which it pitches as a way to make public kiosks controllable by gesturing in the air, instead of by touching a screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4gc6nd"&gt;Literally a week ago — Xiaomi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618043/xiaomi-cyberdog-robot-dog-quadruped-specs-price"&gt;unleashes its robot dog&lt;/a&gt;, which uses RealSense for depth sensing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IdGuyl"&gt;For the most part, the demos were just that — cool applications that didn’t usually end up in the hands of consumers. There were a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/18/9173609/intel-razer-realsense-streaming-vr-camera-announce"&gt;actual RealSense products&lt;/a&gt; over the years, but they rarely held up to what we saw at CES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y62NLP"&gt;Intel &lt;a href="https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-says-it-s-shuttering-realsense-camera-business?itc=refresh"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CRN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll still be fulfilling its obligations to RealSense’s current customers, but said that the employees working on RealSense will be transitioning to other roles more focused on Intel’s core tech. Most people, though, will probably remember RealSense for the cool demos and the promise of easy, drop-in computer vision that didn’t quite seem to work out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5OUYt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this story implied that Project Alloy was announced in 2017, the same year it was canceled. It was actually announced in 2016. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Spectrum TV app is back in Roku’s channel store after being yanked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b19ZeMMImEU9BSzoCgZTKyFlO-o=/0x9:1200x809/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738808/roku_verge.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FVnxJX"&gt;Roku users who’ve been unable to get Charter’s Spectrum TV app through the platform’s channels store can once again do so after months of being unable to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lTEjMA"&gt;Roku &lt;a href="https://blog.roku.com/spectrum-tv-app-roku"&gt;announced on its blog today&lt;/a&gt; that new and existing users can access Spectrum TV on its devices by signing into the app using their Charter broadband credentials or by signing up for an account through Roku. The agreement resolves an ongoing carriage dispute that resulted in Roku pulling the Spectrum TV app from its store in December. The companies issued a joint statement on Tuesday that both had come to “a mutually beneficial agreement to renew distribution of the Spectrum TV App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Grqngx"&gt;“As a result of the renewal, the Spectrum TV App is now available for download from the Roku channel store,” the companies write. “We are pleased to renew our partnership and offer this great streaming experience to our shared customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9qCV4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The app was yanked from Roku’s channel store in December&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VRQWl1"&gt;When the app was pulled from Roku’s store in December, users who already had it installed could continue using it without service interruption. However, any new users hoping to access their service through the platform were out of luck. Spectrum offered a &lt;a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/roku-no-longer-allowing-new-downloads-of-spectrum-tv-app-in-carriage-dispute"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; at the time that despite its “best efforts to reach an agreement, Roku has not accepted Spectrum’s offer to continue our contract.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmkovA"&gt;Neither company offered any further details about the agreement, but Roku’s seen similar support disputes before — even with some of the largest players in streaming. In April, Roku &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22411711/roku-removes-youtube-tv-channel-store"&gt;pulled YouTube TV&lt;/a&gt; from its store, though Google soon after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud"&gt;added support&lt;/a&gt; for its live TV service to the primary YouTube app, giving its users a workaround. Notably, HBO Max didn’t arrive on the Roku platform until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/21272058/hbo-max-roku-watch-wonder-woman-1984-movies-amazon-fire-stream-comcast-warnermedia"&gt;December of last year&lt;/a&gt;, roughly half a year after the service officially launched. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mf1iSedqg7lPxNv9m2aiQTzVyPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738574/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a6g9tj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 17th, 6:04PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXr3jW"&gt;Sony began releasing a fresh batch of PlayStation 5 consoles through its online storefront today at 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT. Both the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;$499.99 version of the PS5&lt;/a&gt; that can accept discs and the &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;discless version that costs $100 less&lt;/a&gt; are currently available for order, however, there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to purchase one if you make it through the public queue, which can take an upwards of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsneZZ"&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with Sony’s ordering process, it uses a slightly better queuing system that automatically places you in line if you’re on its site when the sale goes live. Consoles still tend to sell out quickly, as they have done since the console launched late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vd7KH8"&gt;If you’re looking for tips on securing a PS5, be attentive, listen for the audible chime, and hope that luck is on your side. Oh, and be sure to log into your PlayStation account and enter your shipping and payment information ahead of time. Sony says that it’ll ship the console for free if you purchase something alongside it in your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XTs87f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="4NPUEh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="yTzmyN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XG78YS"&gt;What good is a PS5 without extra games and accessories, though? As mentioned before, Sony will give you free shipping today if you check out with an extra item in your cart in addition to the console, so check out the games and accessories below to see if there’s something you might want. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s still a place for the Note in Samsung’s Galaxy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung has filled out its S-Pen ecosystem of apps nicely." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avsTsud09fJpQdJ5U6vR6EzyvvU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738502/dbohn_201004_4226_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJ5Xmw"&gt;For the first time in many years, August will come and go without the introduction of a new Galaxy Note smartphone from Samsung. Instead, with their lower prices and improved durability, the company is giving its latest foldables — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; — a firm push into the mainstream phone market. With the Z Flip selling for a penny under $1,000, it’s certain to stand out from the iPhone and Samsung’s own Galaxy S21 devices that cost a similar amount (or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjvXvv"&gt;But for repeat buyers of Notes past and present, it does feel like there’s something missing. We’re talking about the brand that established Samsung as the leading manufacturer of huge phones. Yet the company has completely skipped producing a new Note this year and has tried to explain it away with a simple “not this time around.” For now, the lineup isn’t gone; last year’s Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra will remain for sale in 2021. The latter remains a legitimately excellent phone today, so even with Samsung hitting pause for a year, at least there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeKddK"&gt;Samsung’s stance on the Note’s future is vague enough that it leaves room for an eventual return &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620397/samsung-fold-flip-future-galaxy-s-past"&gt;if foldables don’t become the next big thing&lt;/a&gt;. But I’d argue that at least one traditional Galaxy phone with a stylus should remain in the company’s plans regardless. It’s too soon to move on from everything that Samsung was doing so right, and tacking S Pen support onto its other flagship phones doesn’t quite live up to the Note’s legacy. And there are several reasons for the company to give it another go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PmckpE"&gt;People seem to like stylus phones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UJXu2I"&gt;The Note is no doubt the de facto stylus smartphone, but other companies have also found success. Motorola has said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; quickly became the most popular device in the G-series after its release, and that was enough for the company to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22538663/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-review-specs-screen-price"&gt;produce a 5G-capable sequel&lt;/a&gt; this year. And before LG’s complete exit from the smartphone market, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;its Stylo phones&lt;/a&gt; were some of its more popular mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkdzYW"&gt;You can’t overstate the importance of a built-in silo for storing the stylus away when it’s not being used. On the Note, the S Pen is there when you need it — for drawing, signing a PDF, or whatever else — and then it’s gone and completely unobtrusive when you don’t. No add-ons or special phone cases required. Those latter solutions only add friction that can take away from the whole appeal. Using a phone case is perfectly fine, and most people do, but trying to incorporate a stylus slot there is far from ideal if you’ve got normal-sized hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZAfKgY"&gt;The Note deserves a better swan song than the Note 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEFoBH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; was true to the line’s usual recipe of stellar build quality, high-end specs, and a giant screen. But the regular Note 20 was a poorly executed misfire. Samsung’s strategy of pursuing a slightly lower price point made sense, but there were enough compromises with last year’s regular Note that it was difficult to recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NitFnM"&gt;Most glaring of all was that it had a 60Hz display, when even cheaper Samsung phones like the Galaxy S20 FE had evolved to smoother refresh rates. The cameras were worse, it had a plastic back, and all of these tradeoffs were made to reach a still-expensive price of $999.99. In the eyes of many Note fans, it was a frustrating mismatch, and they rejected the Note 20 for it. Marques Brownlee went so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exk34o-MMIE"&gt;call it the “Nope 20.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEbqoh"&gt;This was particularly disappointing after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20845028/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-s-pen-camera-specs-features-price"&gt;got it right the year prior with the Note 10&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn’t saddled with the same number of disappointing concessions. That device felt like it was meant to be a mini version of the larger, flagship Note 10 Plus. But the Note 20 came off more as an example of what happens when a company cuts too many corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Pgg2cE"&gt;A case is an imperfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="REO0KF"&gt;Samsung hyped the addition of S Pen support when it announced the Galaxy Ultra S21 earlier this year. And the experience of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the stylus seems to be on par with a Note. But then you’ve got to &lt;em&gt;put&lt;/em&gt; it somewhere, and that’s where there’s no substitute for an actual Note. Without a designated slot on the phone itself, Samsung’s solution was to make a case that could keep the S21 Ultra and S Pen together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PryxSk"&gt;However, it came with a downside: worse ergonomics. As Dieter wrote in his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;S21 Ultra review&lt;/a&gt;, the phone can feel more manageable in your hands than an iPhone 12 Pro Max because it’s taller and narrower. That easier-to-hold advantage is diminished somewhat by Samsung’s silicone case for the S Pen. Since there’s a permanent holding spot for the stylus on the case’s left side, the device is noticeably larger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBtMX0cXBulzWbcDrZk12pk-S1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788254/2D9400D9_EDF5_4457_B7EF_1DAB684961DE.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung bundled the S Pen with a case for the S21 Ultra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kgCiau"&gt;For the Z Fold 3, Samsung came up with a case design that places a holster at the hinge. I think this will work out better, since the Fold is more narrow than most smartphones (including the S21 Ultra) when closed — so it won’t feel as unwieldy even with the added space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9L1q7"&gt;But unless third-party case makers come up with their own options, you’ll be limited to that one specific Samsung case if you want to carry the S Pen with minimal risk of it being lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tNbHhi"&gt;Selling the S Pen separately makes it feel like an afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8x3gkZ"&gt;Even though it went to the trouble of creating a “Fold Edition” S Pen with a retracting spring tip, Samsung won’t be bundling that with its latest flagship foldable. Rather, you’ve got to buy it (or the pricier S Pen Pro) separately. The Fold Edition comes bundled with its specially designed case for $79, while the S Pen Pro is sold standalone for $99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42tNGI"&gt;An S Pen still comes included with many of Samsung’s latest tablets and laptops. But making it an added purchase on top of the $1,800 Z Fold 3 will probably lead some people to pass on it entirely. If the Fold is meant to usher in a new era of smartphone productivity, why not toss the Fold Edition stylus and case in the box? Maybe that’d ease the sting of not getting a phone charger, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuuVsG"&gt;Another Samsung stylus phone could be great if done right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="e68mX2"&gt;I hope that last year’s models won’t be the end of the line for the Galaxy Note. Samsung still hasn’t come up with an alternative that matches the coherence and convenience of a phone designed with the stylus in mind from the very beginning. But where should the company go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrc7lm"&gt;I could see Samsung choosing the “special edition” route (think Apple’s iPhone SE, but high end) and releasing a new, top-spec Note every few years for the diehard fans that will pay top dollar for their giant slab of glass and S Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aon35j"&gt;But an even better development would be if the stylus trickled down to at least one of Samsung’s popular A-series phones and brought more people into the experience — for much less money. That’d be a clear sign that Samsung is committed to the S Pen, even if the Galaxy Note itself remains on hiatus. The benefits of a stylus shouldn’t be reserved for the $1,000-and-up tier. You’d want a high refresh display since that does genuinely improve the responsiveness of drawing and note-taking. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The Galaxy A52 already checks off that box&lt;/a&gt;, so we know it’s possible even if the company wants to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8BfJJ"&gt;Part of the problem with the Note 20 was Samsung’s messaging: it tried to pass off midrange hardware as something more premium. The pushback and so-so reviews shouldn’t have come as a surprise. But Samsung wouldn’t need to over-sell a Galaxy A-series phone with a stylus: it could be a hit all on its own merits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Premium subscribers can get three months of Stadia Pro for free</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KViuqO"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/This-Week-on-Stadia-Big-releases-Big-deals-Big-week/ba-p/66265"&gt;offering a new promotion to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt; — three free months to try the games included in Stadia Pro, as long as you’re a new subscriber (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/youtube-premium-stadia-pro-offer/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While there’s a chance someone willing to pay to remove ads from YouTube may have already messed around with Stadia, three months is a solid amount of time to see if cloud gaming makes sense for you, and it’s two months longer than Stadia’s usual free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pql7ut"&gt;The deal comes with a few caveats, naturally. Besides limiting the free months to new subscribers, Google is also only offering the promotion in the following countries: the US, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. You can claim the offer until January 31st, 2022, and you have until February 14th, 2022 at 9AM PT to redeem it, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/10693693"&gt;according to Google’s fine print&lt;/a&gt;. If you cancel, expect to be charged Pro’s $9.99 per month price once the three months ends and to lose access to any games you didn’t purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wThyw8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stadio Pro’s library of games is eclectic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mIH1lL"&gt;Stadia Pro includes the benefits of a game library and higher resolution video quality for the games you stream, though it’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/games"&gt;the current selection of games&lt;/a&gt; you can claim for free is a bit... eclectic. There are beloved modern entries like &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt;, smaller indie titles like &lt;em&gt;Floor Kids&lt;/em&gt;, and classic options like &lt;em&gt;Killer Queen Black. &lt;/em&gt;For most newer releases, you’ll have to purchase them outright, and you can find quite a few things to play that way. Stadia Pro subscribers typically get a discount, too.  Even though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google’s taken a step back from Stadia&lt;/a&gt;, the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22624023/stadia-direct-touch-control-scheme-humankind-stadia"&gt;continues receiving interesting new releases&lt;/a&gt; to purchase in its store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUFUU5"&gt;You can redeem the free three months starting today. Stadia also offers games like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/every-game-you-can-play-free-stadia"&gt;to try for free with just a Google account&lt;/a&gt;: no need to provide a credit card just to find out if Stadia works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is struggling to moderate re-creations of mass shootings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzs4IVTRLtIE4tU6fX6X426A6Zk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69738180/acastro_180109_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g4Y81u"&gt;For over a year, Anti-Defamation League researcher Daniel Kelley has been finding re-creations of a horrific mass shooting on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; — and every time he looks, he says he finds more. Kelley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it’s happened three times: first in January 2020, then again in May 2021. The most recent incident came on August 13th, as he was preparing a presentation on how to report offending content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQY6tP"&gt;“I would like one time,” Kelley &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieljkelley/status/1426209012815704068"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; after the last incident, “to search for ‘Christchurch’ on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and not find a new recreation of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting on a game platform aimed at very young children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eT2lL"&gt;The mosque shooting, which killed more than 50 people, has been condemned as one of the most violent single acts of religious hatred undertaken in recent years. In the wake of the shooting, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern &lt;a href="https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/jacinda-ardern-on-mosque-shooting-one-of-new-zealands-darkest-days/"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEsgD2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Each game on ‘Roblox’ is a potentially a social platform in and of itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rebImC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed Kelley’s finding, locating two different &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; experiences focused on the shooting through a simple text search for “Christchurch.” Both rooms had logged more than two hundred visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DffaqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; proactively monitors for terrorist content, but the scenarios flagged by Kelley seem to have slipped through. Reached for comment, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; insisted that the platform is aggressively moderating against re-creations of mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJFWpv"&gt;“We promptly removed this experience from &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; after it was brought to our attention and suspended the user responsible for violating our Community Rules,” a company representative said in a statement. “We do not tolerate racism, discriminatory speech, or content related to tragic events. We have a stringent safety and monitoring system that is continuously active and that we rigorously and proactively enforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezEion"&gt;References to the Christchurch shooting are particularly difficult to block through automatic text searches, the company said, since a catchall filter would also block references to the city. “In this case our proactive detection includes human review to balance allowing references to the geographic location (New Zealand’s largest city) but not uses that violate our policies,” the representative continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSo9pM"&gt;Part of the issue stems from &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s sheer size — the result of rapid and unprecedented growth. The game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq"&gt;currently boasts over 40 million daily users&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a flood of user-generated rooms too massive to manually scan. The distributed structure of the game, which relies on users generating their own scenarios and spaces, makes it particularly challenging to monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Qhr9C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; filed to go public in November, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;claiming in a filing&lt;/a&gt; that the game had been played by more than half the children under 16 in the US. The company is currently valued at roughly $45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrqKM2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;The same IPO filing&lt;/a&gt; specifically names community moderation issues as a potential risk to the business. “The success of our business model is contingent upon our ability to provide a safe online environment for children to experience,” the filing reads. “If we are not able to continue to provide a safe environment, our business will suffer dramatically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdtBdk"&gt;As an extremism researcher, Kelley is less worried about the health of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s business, and more worried that the platform could become a vector for radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqA4el"&gt;“Each game on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is a potentially a social platform in and of itself, and can potentially give refuge to players of all ages who are flirting with or fully engaged with hateful ideologies online,” Kelley says. “Every space that allows for the veneration of hateful ideologies ... contributes to the normalization of these ideologies and their spread.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="tq7nN6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes"&gt;Apple has updated Safari’s design&lt;/a&gt; in the latest iOS 15 beta (Developer Beta 6), making the address bar look and act more like what users are used to and giving you the option to put it at either the top or bottom of the screen. Safari’s redesign, especially on iPhones, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577475/apple-safari-macos-monterey-ios-15-developer-beta-3-change-design"&gt;been controversial&lt;/a&gt; since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;was first announced&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like Apple is starting to walk back the floating design that’s persisted throughout the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj0QLp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacStories&lt;/em&gt; founder and podcaster Federico Viticci has posted screenshots of the new design on Twitter, showing off the changes. If the user chooses to have the address bar on the bottom, it sits above a row of controls, including back and forward buttons, a share button, and the tab button. (In previous versions of the beta, these buttons were one with the address bar.) If the user chooses the option to have the address bar at the top, Safari will look similar to how it did in iOS 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wNWNe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We did it everyone:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safari in iOS 15 beta 6 features a new address bar at the bottom that sits below page content. A toolbar with buttons is back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And we can put the address bar back at the top again   &lt;a href="https://t.co/dbCvauXoDy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dbCvauXoDy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427683610031702017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hzlfWB214q6IXC-JQKxypW0vLhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22788122/IMG_2284.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For comparison, this is Safari’s UI in the previous beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DMjLV0"&gt;Apple has been tweaking and changing Safari’s new design since it made its debut in the first beta. The updates have been relatively small — buttons were added back into the address bar (making it a minefield of touch targets), and Apple &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qtUKzWab71Q?t=256"&gt;made the address bar easier to get to when you’re typing in a URL or search term&lt;/a&gt;. However, the incremental updates haven’t appeased those calling for a return to a more traditional design, one that doesn’t include a floating element that hovers above a webpage’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SaYo3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Options should help please those who (kind of) liked the change, and those who didn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRKvPp"&gt;The option to change where the address bar resides should please those who thought its new place at the bottom was a good one (regardless of how its actual design was executed), as well as those who prefer to have it at the top. It may make things tough for web designers, who will have to deal with the possibility of something butting up against either the top or bottom of their webpage, but it’s a nice option for users to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCHIpb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1427685686849769472?s=20"&gt;According to Viticci&lt;/a&gt;, the iPad version of Safari hasn’t changed with this update, though Apple introduced an option that more or less &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional"&gt;let you go back to a traditional design&lt;/a&gt; in Beta 4.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EVgo launches new pricing plans and a rewards program</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9rSNR"&gt;EVgo is &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005630/en/EVgo-Announces-New-Nationwide-Plan-Options-New-Loyalty-Program-and-Innovative-Pricing-Pilot-in-California"&gt;changing how it prices the electricity&lt;/a&gt; that gets doled out on its electric vehicle charging networ, and is launching a nationwide rewards program for its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlgfKA"&gt;Starting in September, the company will start offering &lt;a href="https://www.evgo.com/newpricing/"&gt;three ways to pay&lt;/a&gt; for charging on its network across the country. There’s the typical pay-as-you go option, which has the highest price-per-minute of charging and requires a $1.99 fee for each charging session. There’s a basic membership program that requires $4.99 per month of pre-payments toward charging, but which waives the session and (in most locations) offers per-minute rates that cost a few cents less. And now there’s a higher-tier $6.99 per-month subscription plan called EVgo Plus that drops the session fees and offers even more affordable pricing, and waives the $3 fee for reserving a charging stall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbn65Q"&gt;In California, however, EVgo will no longer charge per minute of charging in order to &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/07/update-californias-ban-on-per-minute-billing-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;comply with new state regulations&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it will charge per kilowatt-hour (kWh). There will be three different pricing windows throughout the day: “early-bird” (12AM-8AM local time), “on-peak” (4PM-9PM), and “off-peak” (8AM-4PM and 9PM-12AM). The idea with these is to incentivize drivers to charge at hours when electricity is not only more affordable, but also when the grid is less stressed. EVgo says it may expand this windowed pricing structure to other states down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBPDfG"&gt;“We want to make sure that we’re maximizing the positive impact of the grid and give customers choice,” EVgo’s chief commercial officer Jonathan Levy tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you want to charge when it’s peak [hours] then that’s your choice, but there’s an economic reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hJ7tpM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Charging company EVgo is going public via SPAC merger","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9cIi4T"&gt;EVgo is also trialing new location-based pricing adjustments in San Francisco and Los Angeles that will factor in “environmental and social justice considerations,” congestion, and “other market dynamics.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oX2v6R"&gt;Along with the new pricing structures, EVgo will give out five “points” for every dollar spent on charging, which the company says can be used toward free charging sessions. Users of any of the three pricing plans can earn these points, though EVgo didn’t say how many would be required to unlock a free charging session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leQpPJ"&gt;“Reliability has been such an important facet for electric vehicle drivers, so we want to make sure that they’re rewarded for continuing to be loyal to us and coming back to those EVgo chargers they know they can count on,” Levy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Dxh8"&gt;The changes come as EVgo recently became a publicly traded company, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243080/evgo-chargin-spac-public-cris-david-crane-cathy-zoi"&gt;a merger with a special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;, or SPAC. It’s not alone — ChargePoint went public earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210301005278/en/ChargePoint-Becomes-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-Publicly-Traded-Global-EV-Charging-Network"&gt;merging with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, while others like EVBox and Wallbox have similar mergers in the works. These mergers are helping to bring a fresh round of investment to companies like EVgo, which could help make public EV chargers more ubiquitous. Expanding EV charging networks is a priority of the Biden administration and a focus of the infrastructure bill working its way through Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6fm5v"&gt;EVgo is also making these changes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;Tesla is getting ready to potentially open up&lt;/a&gt; its own Supercharger network to non-Tesla EVs, something that would make the company eligible for government subsidies under the infrastructure bill. &lt;/p&gt;
