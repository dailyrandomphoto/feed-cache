    <title>Twitch overhauls its rules around harassment and hateful conduct </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dQAVKL46mPU44aGZ1IjtWRdSa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484822/acastro_190926_1777_twitch_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYEAaG"&gt;Today, Twitch is announcing changes to its policies around harassment and hateful conduct. The reason, the company says, is because marginalized people — “women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Black, Indigenous, and people of color,” the company wrote in a blog post — are disproportionately harassed on the site. The new policy is far more specific about what constitutes harassment and abuse. The larger changes include stricter protections around sexual harassment, the policy extending off platform to an extent, and that enforcement in cases that are harder to judge will rely on external signals that the behavior was unwanted (like channel timeouts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMgUAv"&gt;A bigger overhaul has come to Twitch’s policy regarding sexual harassment; it’s now much more stringent in what is and isn’t permitted, and it now has its own category in the terms of service. The policy now prohibits “[r]epeatedly commenting on someone’s perceived attractiveness, even in what you believe to be a positive or complimentary manner,” if there’s an indication the behavior is unwelcome (if you’ve been asked to stop, been banned from the channel, or timed out); it also forbids “[m]aking lewd or explicit comments about anyone’s sexuality or physical appearance,” specifically stating that the company will not make an exception for public figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvLVpG"&gt;Twitch says that new rules will apply to content created on January 22nd — the day it goes into effect — and afterward. The company also says that while the policy is more stringent in some ways, it will also dole out punishments according to severity. Enforcement will also depend on signals from targeted individuals in cases where potentially offending behavior is more subjective. “In the event of a more subjective situation, for example competitive banter or trash talk, will rely on signals from the person being targeted, or their mods, so that we can take appropriate action and avoid punishing users in situations where that behavior is welcome,” the company wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ovxCm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stream sniping gets its own line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbLjX6"&gt;Mostly, it seems that the new policy is aimed at plugging the holes in the old one. For example, the Confederate flag is now banned in chat, and promoting “hateful viewpoints under the guise of education or comedy” will lead to a suspension. Stream sniping gets its own line; it’s banned. And broadcasters who don’t make an effort to curtail “incitement or organization of abuse” in their own channels will be banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2LtLA"&gt;Twitch says it has worked with its Safety Advisory Council and industry experts for months on the new rules, and the effort shows. Streamers and audiences should read the new guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because they’re worth reading in full. Twitch is also hosting three events over the next month to familiarize broadcasters and their communities with the new rules: a “Creator Camp” discussion of the policy on December 11th, a town hall on December 16th covering enforcement, and a final Creator Camp on January 6th to review the policy again and answer frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W9mat"&gt;All told, it looks like Twitch has decided to take serious action against its most toxic users. But as with any policy, its effectiveness depends on the company’s willingness to enforce its own rules. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches health research app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google New York Chelsea Office (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqYtOgIQB8yUItQCuEiNNutl8RI=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484694/google-logo-stock-31_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4ivc0"&gt;Google announced Wednesday that it is launching a new research app for Android phones, which would allow anyone with a device to participate in medical studies. The first study run through the app, called Google Health Studies, will look at respiratory illnesses like the flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJVlhD"&gt;Participants in the study will use the app to report any respiratory symptoms, the precautions they’re taking to prevent disease, and whether they’ve been tested for COVID-19 or the flu. The app will collect &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;demographic data&lt;/a&gt;, like age, gender, and race as well. “Researchers in this study can examine trends to understand the link between mobility (such as the number of daily trips a person makes outside the home) and the spread of COVID-19,” Google wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/google-health-studies-app/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvC55E"&gt;The app will send data to researchers using a technique called federated learning, which will batch aggregated trends from multiple devices, rather than pull information from each participant individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5nQAn"&gt;Health Studies is Google’s answer to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fresearch-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165465%2Fgoogle-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Research app&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on iOS devices. Last year, it launched &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F11%2Fapple-launches-three-innovative-studies-today-in-the-new-research-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165465%2Fgoogle-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on menstrual cycles, mobility and heart health, and hearing. Apple also lets researchers build their own iPhone apps through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/10/8177683/apple-research-kit-app-ethics-medical-research"&gt;ResearchKit program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dBE5B"&gt;Studies run through the app will come with the same caveats as research from other commercial wearable products: they can only enroll people who can purchase products like an Android phone. Aggregated data is a good way to protect privacy, but it means researchers aren’t able to take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;granular look&lt;/a&gt; at information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afz4N1"&gt;Android phone users have a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-median-income-for-iphone-users-is-40-higher-than-that-of-android-users-2014-9"&gt;lower median income&lt;/a&gt; than iPhone users, which might be a benefit for Google Health Studies. “Android represents probably a more diverse dataset [than iPhone]. We’re pretty excited about the ability to leverage that,” John Brownstein, a chief innovation officer of Boston Children’s Hospital working on the study with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hb9XK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are back down to $190 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zKVJn3AO7rbqjw6BL8xep6rSVuY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484304/cwelch_191031_3763_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ufcgT"&gt;If you’re struggling to think of a gift for someone in your life, it’s hard to fail with a good set of headphones. Thankfully, many of the best models currently available have seen sharp discounts in the lead-up to the holidays. Today’s standout deals are on the Apple AirPods Pro at Woot for $190 (around $220 everywhere else). Now that the $550 AirPods Max are a thing, the Pro is no longer the most expensive model. Also worth sharing today is a deal on Microsoft’s Surface Headphones, a noise-canceling over-ear model for $150 instead of its usual $200 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTeiCU"&gt;We’ve also found some noteworthy deals on PS4 games that might be on a wish list you’re in charge of tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gfb7aP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FXUzP"&gt;Headphones and earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SKbG0n"&gt;Woot is offering the AirPods Pro for $190. They cost $250 from Apple directly, though most retailers are selling them for around $220. Woot says your order will arrive by Christmas. This model features noise cancellation as well as better sound and a more snug fit than standard AirPods because of their silicon tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="la9tiB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4hiXq"&gt;Microsoft’s over-ear noise-canceling wireless Surface Headphones are just $150 at Woot. These haven’t sold for lower than $190 at Amazon, so this is a fantastic deal on a new set. Compared to competing headphones from Sony and Bose, these stand out with their ingenious rotating dials for adjusting the volume and the level of noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jDKSff"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10217227"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="z8GQs2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="StZwzT"&gt;Fitbit’s fittest smartwatch is $70 off for the first time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HiuI6N"&gt;The Fitbit Sense, the company’s smartwatch that can take EKGs and determine stress levels by taking your skin’s temperature, is $260 at Best Buy and Amazon. It usually costs $330, and this is the biggest discount yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QeBNRu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mel1NG"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Gg7rAb"&gt;Some PS5-ready games are discounted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3NtOqL"&gt;At several retailers like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dholidaysaleps4xb%26srule%3Dtop-sellers%26rt%3DplpRedesign%26sv%3Dnew%26pmax%3D10.00%26prefn1%3DavailabilityFilter%26prefv1%3DshipsIn24Hours" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726068073818073061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon, and Target, you can find discounts on first-party PS4 games, most of which play great on the PS5. These aren’t best-ever deals, but they’re certainly more affordable than their usual asking prices. Here are a couple of newer releases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fThHY5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591200" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="0gaBxt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="j6EyIh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube will now remove videos disputing Joe Biden’s election victory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBqRpVFSbVsivwDoC3T3xa9MyOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484171/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsmU55"&gt;On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it will begin removing any content alleging widespread voter fraud influenced the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvfnVL"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the November 3rd election, YouTube came under fire for allowing channels to publish videos making false claims about election results. In one instance, One America News Network, a verified YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; declaring that “Trump won” the election. At the time, YouTube defended its decision to let the video stand, saying in a statement, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5dbuP"&gt;The company went on to say that content from “authoritative news organizations” were “the most popular videos about the election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXqZYU"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;Wednesday blog&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube said that its decision to begin removing misleading election videos follows the US’s safe harbor deadline and that “enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect.” Starting Wednesday, YouTube will begin removing any new content that misleads viewers about the outcome of the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTLMS"&gt;YouTube’s announcement follows a series of lawsuits placed by the Donald Trump campaign challenging the results of the election. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected a request to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/supreme-court-republican-challenge-pennsylvania-vote.html"&gt;block certification&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania’s election results, making it nearly impossible for Republicans to invalidate Joe Biden’s victory in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4kkjm"&gt;In the post, YouTube said its election information panels had surfaced over 200,000 election-related videos and were shown over 4.5 billion times. The company said that it would &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;update these panels&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, linking to electoral college results provided by the Office of the Federal Register calling Biden the official president-elect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFyrSR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft confirms the xCloud beta is coming to iOS and PC in spring 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dh7XplQQMoR5eJ-7VJQCDpAp5cI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484147/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JxmC9"&gt;Microsoft has confirmed its timeline for bringing its xCloud cloud gaming service to Apple’s iOS platform and to Windows PCs, with the company saying it will support iPhone, iPad, and PC starting in spring 2021. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;reported in October&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft was looking to bring xCloud to iOS via a mobile web app some time in “early 2021,” but Microsoft has clarified the timing in a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/09/xbox-expands-cloud-gaming-to-more-devices-2021/"&gt;blog post published on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The PC version of xCloud will be delivered through the Xbox app for Windows 10, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3puCg"&gt;“In Spring 2021, we will take the next step in our journey to reach more players around the world by making cloud gaming as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate available on Windows PCs through the Xbox app and browser, and iOS devices through mobile web browser,” writes Jerret West, Microsoft’s Xbox marketing chief, in the blog post. “By adding over a billion devices as a path to playing in the Xbox ecosystem, we envision a seamless experience for all types of players.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oaqono"&gt;&lt;q&gt;xCloud is coming to iOS via the web and PC via the Xbox app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V8aq3M"&gt;xCloud will still be bundled as part of Microsoft’s $15 a month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Microsoft says it plans to launch its cloud gaming beta through Game Pass to more markets next year, including Australia, Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Np1o"&gt;Due to limitations Apple has imposed on iOS apps and cloud services, Microsoft wasn’t able to support the iPhone and iPad when it launched xCloud in beta for Android in September. The two companies got into a public spat over whether xCloud in its current form could ever exist on the iPhone, after Apple said such a service would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;need to submit individual games for review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV739"&gt;Although Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;offered Microsoft a compromise of sorts&lt;/a&gt; by allowing cloud gaming apps to run their cloud clients on iOS so long as they still submitted individual titles for review, the Xbox maker said such a solution would be a “bad experience for consumers” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;decided to focus on a mobile web offering instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBGvts"&gt;Other cloud gaming providers have decided to do the same, and both Google and Nvidia announced mobile web versions of their respective services last moth. Nvidia’s is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt;, with its GeForce Now cloud service running on iOS in beta. Google plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;launch an iOS version of its Stadia service&lt;/a&gt; via the mobile web before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PixelJunk Eden 2 is a stylish sequel to an indie classic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lo9WByPkeawdC_IyrihBDiznhvM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484044/pixeljunk_eden_2_switch_screenshot06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GT125j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PixelJunk Eden&lt;/em&gt; was ahead of its time. The idea of a download-only indie game with arty, abstract 2D graphics and a pulsing techno soundtrack doesn’t sound remotely unusual in 2020, but there really wasn’t much like &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; when it dropped on the PS3 in 2008. Developed by Kyoto’s Q-Games, with music and visuals from local-artist-turned-creative-director Baiyon, &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; was a hypnotic triumph, if a little more challenging than its chill vibe might have led you to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbyBPh"&gt;Now we have a sequel, &lt;em&gt;PixelJunk Eden 2&lt;/em&gt;, which is coming out today as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Much of the content and music is repurposed from a 2018 mobile game, &lt;em&gt;Eden Obscura&lt;/em&gt;. If it’s new to you, though, &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; will feel like a true sequel — and one that can be friendlier to play than the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyx2Pt"&gt;The basic premise is identical. Every stage is set in a garden, and your goal is to help your tiny character reach a glowing “spectra” somewhere on the map. You do this by growing the plants in the garden. Think of it as a platformer where there aren’t many platforms until you set them down yourself. There are seeds placed throughout the level, and you fill them up by swinging on a thread to collect floating pollen spores nearby. Once a seed is full, you can bounce or swing into it and cause branches to sprout out, which will help you get to more seeds, spores, and, ultimately, the spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dlV_uvDdNmK919DxMJcB120bWtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22156693/pixeljunk_eden_2_switch_screenshot06.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fS7jWH"&gt;If this sounds esoteric, it’s much simpler in practice. The entire game is played with a single analog stick and a jump button, and really all you have to master is the physics of swinging around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjKoDb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; is also a lot more forgiving than its predecessor, which had a brutal time limit and would frequently send you plummeting all the way to the bottom of the garden if you missed a jump. Some of the ways that &lt;em&gt;Eden Obscura&lt;/em&gt; adapted its controls to be more forgiving on touchscreens have made their way back to &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt;’s traditional interface; you can hover in place, for example, and jump multiple times before landing. &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; also brings you back to your jumping-off point if you fall too far, and there are checkpoints around the map that reset the time limit — though, really, I think the game would be better off losing the time limit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXJRK6"&gt;The visuals and music are familiar but no less mesmerizing. Baiyon’s soundtrack has a more organic feel than that of the original, which was very much of its time; its sparse minimal techno could’ve been lifted straight from a mid-2000s Kompakt compilation. (I say that in a good way: &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; was a post-club staple of mine for years.) This is still definitely a game you should be playing with headphones or at loud volume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cLH-kceNGO8BKOA_uOLJNBm0EZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22156694/pixeljunk_eden_2_switch_screenshot05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBuMEB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt;’s structure is a little odd. It serves you up a selection of levels, each of which you have to finish once to be presented with another set. You can’t replay any of them at will, which is in contrast to the original game’s map screen that let you jump directly into each stage. I like the shift to simpler menus, but I would have preferred to start out with more conventional progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTyzTO"&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;PixelJunk Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; is an easy recommendation. It resurrects an indie classic and makes it much less frustrating to play, which I would call an improvement for something that ought to be perfect for zoning out. &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; isn’t quite as novel a prospect as the original was 12 years ago, but it still manages to stand out as uniquely stylish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5VAL1"&gt;&lt;small&gt;PixelJunk Eden 2 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out today for the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid HBO Max and Warner Bros. chaos, entertainment executives defend streaming push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1xCjkdzVXRdnfUmsn6K3oNRUHg=/125x0:575x300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484038/godzilla_kong.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="07PZcw"&gt;Christopher Nolan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;may be seething&lt;/a&gt;, but CEOs for AT&amp;amp;T, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS each reiterated their commitment to streaming at a UBS conference on Monday amid chaos in Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiyuqv"&gt;Following WarnerMedia’s announcement that it would shift the Warner Bros. 2021 movie slate into a hybrid release, debuting movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;on HBO Max at the same time they hit theaters&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey provided a small update on HBO Max as he defended WarnerMedia’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5DP17"&gt;The streamer is nearing 12.6 million active subscribers, according to Stankey, as &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/att-ceo-defends-warne-bros-streaming-plan-hbo-max-nears-12-6m-activated-subs"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s about 4 million more since AT&amp;amp;T’s last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528234/hbo-max-subscribers-activations-att-directv-warner"&gt;update in late October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Active&lt;/em&gt; is the key word. Technically, HBO Max has 28.7 million eligible subscribers who can upgrade from HBO’s linear cable plan into Max, but not all of those with eligible plans have jumped on the offer. It’s something that WarnerMedia and AT&amp;amp;T executives know is an issue — one not likely helped by the confusing branding and rollout — and one that executives are hoping having high-profile movies will help solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZxu8p"&gt;Stankey believes having the films will help to “penetrate the market faster” and scale the platform’s subscriber growth at a time when people in the United States aren’t likely to get out to theaters for much of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zxpaqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I know there’s a lot of noise out in the market.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3PNzv"&gt;The first move came when Warner Bros. shifted &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;to a simultaneous release in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. Then, everything else followed. Internationally, where HBO Max doesn’t exist and WarnerMedia has less incentive to grow a product and where movies might perform better with more theaters open, films will play exclusively in theaters before hitting digital retailers. In the US, where HBO Max growth is a vital concern and theaters remain closed in key markets, WarnerMedia is using the opportunity presented to them — even if it angers different parts of Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iu8vlI"&gt;“I know there’s a lot of noise out in the market, people with different viewpoints,” Stankey said, adding that this is anticipated “anytime you are going to change a model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtSa3X"&gt;Stankey was in part addressing comments made by Nolan, who has worked with Warner Bros. for years and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;condemned the move&lt;/a&gt;. Talent agents and the various guilds within Hollywood were also taken aback, and reports that Legendary Pictures &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/warnermedia-legendary-challenge-dune-godzilla-vs-kong-streamer-battles-looming-1234651283/"&gt;is planning legal action&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21453047/dune-delay-release-date-warner-bros-wonder-woman-disney-marvel-black-widow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs Kong&lt;/em&gt;’s move have started appearing. Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff also addressed the backlash in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/warner-bros-ceo-defends-2021-film-release-model-in-talks-with-talent.html"&gt;new interview with CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;saying that changes were brought on by the pandemic, using Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;as a way to demonstrate Warner Bros.’ commitment to theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsaewc"&gt;“We have many movies, which are ready to go, and they’ve been sitting on shelves,” Sarnoff said. “We thought this was the most creative and win-win situation to bring them out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdxmCn"&gt;It’s not just AT&amp;amp;T and WarnerMedia executives who positioned the pivot to streaming as an inevitable and irrevocable move forward in the industry. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell spoke at the same conference, announcing that Peacock reached more than 26 million signups, but he didn’t specify how many were paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pqCtkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have many movies, which are ready to go, and they’ve been sitting on shelves.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2p1yeK"&gt;Shell, like other CEOs, defended the importance of theatrical experiences. Universal isn’t shifting its slate of 2021 movies to Peacock, although Peacock isn’t exactly the same bet that HBO Max is for AT&amp;amp;T. If theaters are still not where they need to be by the time &lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;comes out in May, it’s a little easier for Universal to delay the title instead of feeding it into Peacock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSEJsA"&gt;Still, there’s always the possibility that Shell and his company could move titles to Peacock or, more likely, digital retailers in 2021. It was Universal that first angered theater chains like AMC after moving &lt;em&gt;Trolls World Tour &lt;/em&gt;to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184030/universal-trolls-world-tour-hunt-coronavirus-birds-of-prey-warner-bros-disney-paramount-vod-digital"&gt;digital-only title in March&lt;/a&gt;, and it was Universal that worked out a deal with AMC to shorten the period of time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;a movie must play in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. As cliche as it’s become in 2020, it’s impossible to say for certain what companies will do in the next six months because it’s impossible to know what the next six months hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXanjf"&gt;“I think that theatrical will continue to thrive and the more windows can collapse so there’s other ways to see things at home and in a less premium fashion, the more money is going to be made by everybody involved in the movie business and it’s better for consumers,” Shell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNwYsj"&gt;Finally, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish also spoke about the company’s interest in developing a number of streaming platforms, including CBS All Access (soon to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo"&gt;be Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;) and its free, ad-supported streamer, Pluto TV. Bakish revealed that ViacomCBS is predicting about 40 million average monthly Pluto TV users around the world and 19 million combined subscribers for CBS All Access and Showtime’s streamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BWBihx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hollywood is experiencing its own “move fast and break things” moment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0wmIKX"&gt;When it comes to next year’s movies, however, Bakish wouldn’t say one way or another what happens. The CEO noted that the company has 12 movies, which includes four major franchise films. Regardless of what happens, Bakish recognized that even in a post-COVID 19 world, “it’s pretty clear that the theatrical windows will evolve and get shorter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4uGC3"&gt;“I think there is a role for theatrical... but in parallel, some of these new monetization paths that we’re seeing are going to be more common,” Bakish said, as &lt;a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/viacomcbs-ceo-bob-bakish-says-theatrical-windows-are-bound-to-get-shorter-post-covid-19"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Streamable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I think the film category will continue to be strategic and valuable, but is certainly evolving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0OeOc"&gt;The issue boils down to talent and various agencies wanting what they know and executives wanting what’s next. Hollywood is experiencing its own “move fast and break things” moment. (Let’s see what happens with Disney during its big investor day focused on streaming initiatives.) The issue is that the film industry’s structure isn’t built for moving fast, and the cost of breaking things is yet to be seen.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG’s new creative director wants to put the focus back on survival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRWnb7PiUe4GRzLHrydevxmPC1Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483699/7._parachute_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj49d4"&gt;It’s been a year of experimentation for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;. Over the course of 2020, the genre-defining battle royale game received new, smaller maps and tightly focused gameplay modes. December 16th will see the debut of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s 10th season, which introduces new AI enemies in a dense, 32-player map called “Haven.” Looking ahead, though, &lt;em&gt;PUBG’&lt;/em&gt;s new creative director Dave Curd says this process of testing ideas has helped the team find what makes the game distinct among the sea of battle royale games it inspired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbP5Fv"&gt;“[In] 2020, we made a lot of small maps, mainly because we’re trying to find the range of what’s acceptable,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “Now that we’ve had this year of development, my feeling is those big, long stretches of downtime, punctuated with exciting gunfights, that I think has the most unique &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; flavor. I think that’s what we do best that our competitors don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM4Cgt"&gt;Curd has been in the role for the last few months, serving as &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s first creative director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18283804/pubg-brendan-greene-playerunknown-interview-special-projects-gdc-2019"&gt;since creator Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene&lt;/a&gt; stepped down last year to start a new project. Curd has worked on the game for three years, starting out as an artist before heading up the relatively new &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; studio in Madison, Wisconsin. Prior to that, he served as art director at &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Raven Software. He says that, as part of his new role, he thinks a lot about the long-term life of &lt;em&gt;PUBG &lt;/em&gt;— and that process involves defining what exactly the game is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFG3BNFq8xqJf_YIG1r8f5gFSlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154515/4._PILLAR.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2sJ85A"&gt;“We’re always curious what’s beyond the blue circle,” he says. “We don’t see the game of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; as a giant team death match with a shrinking circle. We see it as a survival experience. If you think about &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve got really deep, interesting gunplay, and I think that’s contributed to our staying power. But if you analyze a match of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, a very small percentage of your time is actually spent shooting. Most of the time you’re in survival phase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OzlMB0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The game has a really steep learning curve.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKOOOm"&gt;One of the challenges has been figuring out how to make that phase more interesting, particularly for new players. One of the goal’s of the new season 10 map is to create more interactions for players outside of fighting each other. The new AI soldiers, for instance, guard valuable gear, forcing players to make a decision about whether it’s worth the risk to engage. Similarly, the new tactical parachute is meant to make traversing the dense, more vertical map a more fun experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmH0ns"&gt;“You think about a new user who joins &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; today. They download it, they boot it up: the players they’re encountering are very challenging to compete with,” Curd explains. “All of the players that have been here for years have amazing recoil control, they really understand how to follow the circle, and they’re just amazing veterans. So if you’re a new user, I think it’s really difficult. The game has a really steep learning curve. So we’re playing with this in season 10 by giving more adventures to get into and more ways to get out of trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xr7GNjr8uyP3iCGL8ZWPYtuVds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154517/6._Pillar_Tactical.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GBZ3nA"&gt;The goal is that these new experiences will make players stick around and dig deeper into the main survival experience. Similarly, the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; team has also been experimenting with storytelling — there’s even &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;a lore website&lt;/a&gt; — in an attempt to find more ways to lure people in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVyF5N"&gt;It’s a very tricky balancing act, trying to grow a popular game with a dedicated player base. It’s especially challenging now as the battle royale genre is arguably as popular as its ever been, with games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; all enjoying healthy player bases. Some of those titles have introduced bots and experimented with easier modes in an attempt to make the experience more approachable for new players — &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s last few years have been largely defined by developer Epic’s attempts to balance casual and competitive play, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20829047/epic-fortnite-mech-suit-brute-nerf-update-changes-arena-champion-series"&gt;often with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KenbCh"&gt;But Curd says that the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; team is using a different philosophy. “That’s something that’s been on my mind,” he says. “Not making the game easier, or even friendlier, but just making it more interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3bnHt"&gt;Season 10 of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; launches December 16th on PC, followed by a console version on the 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1pRlu2zGU3hZpuaUe8V5Ambb6Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483711/VRG_TEC_Verge2020Favorites_YT.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZuVKE"&gt;We covered nearly a hundred products &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVerge"&gt;on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and countless more here on the site. But while we return all our review units, there are some products we get sad about having to send back — so sad, in fact, that we end up buying them for ourselves (or at least have wishful thoughts about buying them) because we simply can’t live without them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbe4JI"&gt;What follows are some of the gadgets that our staff &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zosXUy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Lu_YmJPFKdJRYUzrls70R4q0d4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699406/cwelch_200804_4129_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="roA9Jc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live (or the Galaxy Beans as they should have been called) aren’t the perfect pair of true wireless headphones, but they fit my specific needs perfectly. That’s because I wanted a pair of earbuds to wear while cycling. So for starters, they couldn’t be too bulky or have a stem that’d catch on the straps of my helmet. Nor did I want a pair of earbuds that were too good at blocking out environmental noise; it’s more important for me to hear incoming traffic than the end of a guitar solo. That turned the Beans’ open-air design from a negative into a positive for me. Throw in a USB-C port and support for wireless charging, and you’re left with my favorite gadget of the year. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XwODbg"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 is a big compromise as a platform, since it ties virtual reality directly to the Facebook service. As a gadget, though, it can’t be beat. The Quest 2 is the first piece of consumer VR hardware without a big and obvious compromise. It’s self-contained and can be used without any wires, but you can also plug it into a laptop to play higher-powered games. It’s light enough to wear without hurting your head, although it’s best when tricked out with an alternate head strap and some special short-cord headphones. And it supports some of the best VR games around, including my personal obsession &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145103/beat-saber-game-of-the-year-psvr-oculus-vive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Quest 2 isn’t quite the Nintendo Switch of virtual reality — but it’s surprisingly close. &lt;em&gt;— Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="JOzQA5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peloton bike &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDn3ln"&gt;Reviewing the new Peloton bike, the Bike Plus, has been a bright spot in a horrifying year. I’m still testing it and working on the review, but the small bugs I’ve found so far don’t take away from the fact that having a place to listen to good music, sweat, and work out all my 2020 frustrations has been incredible. I need an outlet for everything I’m feeling from being cooped up in my apartment. That said, the bike costs nearly $2,500 with a $40 monthly subscription plan attached. It’s a massive cost that is tempting for me to spend, but I do wonder if, when the pandemic wanes, I’ll crave in-person gym experiences again. &lt;em&gt;— Ashley Carman, senior reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nEtI3V"&gt;The PS5 was one of my most highly anticipated pieces of tech this year, and I am happy to say it has lived up to the expectations I set for the console. While I still have concerns on how expandable storage will work, I find the PS5 to have had a stronger launch than its competitor, the Xbox Series X, for this reason: namely, the DualSense is one of the most innovative controllers I have seen in the last few years. Its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers provide extra realism to immerse me even more in the games I play. &lt;em&gt;— Taylor Lyles, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MWMCMF"&gt;I reviewed a whole bunch of convertible laptops this year, but the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the closest to being one that I’d actually consider buying. There are certainly things I don’t love about it: the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste, and the lack of USB-A ports means I can’t connect some of my peripherals without a dongle. But when it comes to the most important aspects of a 2-in-1 laptop, the XPS 13 doesn’t just check all the boxes — it blows the boxes off the page. The build quality is exceptional, the touchpad is comfortable, the 16:10 display is roomy and gorgeous, the battery life lasts all day, and the chassis is unbelievably thin and light. You can even play games like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; at well above 60fps. As someone looking for a reliable, portable machine, I really couldn’t ask for anything more. &lt;em&gt;— Monica Chin, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NZT02l"&gt;DJI’s new Mini 2 drone is the drone I didn’t really expect to love as much as I do. It’s not the ultimate do-it-all drone — in fact, it misses a lot of features you’d find on more expensive drones. The Mini 2 doesn’t have any obstacle avoidance sensors, it has a tiny photo sensor, and photos are only 12MP. But it also nails the basics: those 12MP photos look sharp, dynamic range is good for that small sensor, and video looks crisp. It also has two awesome features: it includes DJI’s OcuSync 2 wireless connectivity and it weighs only 249g. OcuSync 2 enables radio transmission and a nearly impeccable connection, compared to the flaky Wi-Fi connection in the original Mavic Mini. And being a sub-250g drone means you don’t need FAA registration (but be sure to follow other FAA regulations). It’s easy to bring anywhere you go and it’s incredibly fun to fly. If you’re a content creator, drone enthusiast, or a total beginner, this is a perfect drone to get. &lt;em&gt;— Vjeran Pavic, senior director &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H3DybO"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini isn’t the best iPhone 12 for most people. If you asked me, I’d tell you to get the regular iPhone 12 or maybe the 12 Pro Max, especially if you really care about the camera. But the 12 mini is my favorite and the one I purchased. It has been a very long time since we’ve had a small phone with true flagship specs. Usually, smaller phones are either nonexistent or deeply compromised. With the 12 mini, there’s really only one compromise that matters: the battery life isn’t great. That’s the reason I don’t recommend it right off the bat. But if you’re aware of that battery life and think it can fit into your lifestyle, having a small phone again is great. It just feels like it was designed for human hands instead of being designed to maximize the screen size. That’s why it’s my favorite. &lt;em&gt;— Dieter Bohn, executive editor &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ainmSd"&gt;Fujifilm went back to the basics with the Instax SQ1, which is absolutely the least tech-y gadget I reviewed this year. With no screens, only two shooting modes, and a rotating ring around the lens that turns the camera on and off, the SQ1 feels more like a toy than a $120 camera. And it’s perfect that way because it inspires creativity and fun. Although it’s a bit bulky, the joy it provides by instantly developing memories in that iconic Polaroid frame still makes me want to bring it everywhere. Plus, taking photos of the contents of your friends’ refrigerators and then hiding the photo under the milk carton never gets old. &lt;em&gt;— Becca Farsace, senior director&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp criticizes Apple’s new app privacy labels over iMessage inconsistency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FdqPyA2heneUL-6ea89jj6hcKZI=/6x0:1086x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483603/verge-whatsapp-notification-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naXIJs"&gt;WhatsApp has hit back at Apple over its new privacy labels for apps in the App Store, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it’s unfair that they don’t appear to cover the pre-installed first-party service iMessage, since it’s not available on the App Store. The Facebook-owned messaging service reportedly submitted its privacy label information to Apple on Monday, and it has &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/unpacking-whatsapps-privacy-label-in-the-apple-app-store"&gt;published an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; outlining what each label means in terms of the service’s data collection, and why it needs this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwfNul"&gt;“We think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps as well as reflect the strong measures apps may take to protect people’s private information,” WhatsApp told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. Although it said giving users easy-to-read privacy information is “a good start,” it added that “it’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zpyb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2mbX"&gt;Apple first announced the new privacy labels feature as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;host of new privacy features at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Likening them to the nutrition labels used on packaged groceries, the company said the feature should provide app users with more information about the data being collected on them. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#main:~:text=This%20information%20will%20be%20required%20to,App%20Store%20starting%20December%208%2C%202020"&gt;As of December 8th&lt;/a&gt;, developers are required to provide the information when submitting new apps and updates, however &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;notes that it’s unclear when they’ll start appearing on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT7R75"&gt;Facebook has also been critical of other aspects of Apple’s privacy push this year, like its requirement that developers show a warning and ask for permission to collect a user’s Identification for Advertisers (IDFA) starting with iOS 14. This is an identifier which helps advertisers target their ads. In response, Facebook said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;would stop collecting IDFA information&lt;/a&gt; through its apps, in a move that would “severely impact” its ad network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYC5km"&gt;“This is not a change we want to make, but unfortunately Apple’s updates to iOS 14 have forced this decision,” Facebook said at the time, “We know this may severely impact publishers’ ability to monetize through Audience Network on iOS 14, and, despite our best efforts, may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14 in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFNAMf"&gt;Apple later announced that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delaying the launch of the privacy feature&lt;/a&gt; until “early next year” to allow developers to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWs4pu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAuMP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
