    <title>Spotify makes it easier to block other users</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Spotify Stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2DVE5skyrgccPMuOSoLYgGTs8kw=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124224/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify has made it easier to block other users | Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DBCbRU"&gt;Spotify is rolling out a new feature that will allow users to more easily block others on the platform. Previously, users had to contact customer support to block someone, but now the feature is easier to find on a user profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ug8D8g"&gt;To block a user, go to their Spotify profile. Under their username and photo, above their public playlists and next to the “follow” button, click the three dots menu and choose “block,” or on mobile, “block user.” Now that user won’t be able to access your listening activity, your page, or any public playlists. You also can unblock a user you’ve previously blocked at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to block a user on Spotify.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KEETpk"&gt;“At Spotify, we’re committed to delivering the best possible listening experience to our users,” a company spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;“Privacy is something that is, and always will be, enormously important to us and our block feature, which gives users more control, is the latest step towards that commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvV5XN"&gt;The company introduced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/21/18191332/spotify-block-feature-mute-artists-music"&gt;“block artist” feature in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but users have been asking for a way to block other users for the past several years. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/spotify-still-wont-enable-a-feature-that-would-let-its"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; did an in-depth report on Spotify users&lt;/a&gt; who were stalked and harassed by other users but who were unable to prevent the harassers from viewing their activity on the platform. &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Social-Block-Followers/idi-p/310496/page/53"&gt;At the time, Spotify said&lt;/a&gt; it was putting the introduction of a block user capability “under consideration.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHJb1d"&gt;Spotify says the change should be available to users this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgkyaX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhwMOR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Screenshots reveal what extra information the Robinhood hackers accessed </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b36sPGT7ymnaNOcZ44RUy6hXLrg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124123/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I0tsZl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxdmn/robinhood-hackers-internal-tool-security-features?utm_source=motherboard_twitter"&gt;Screenshots obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reportedly show the internal Robinhood tools that a hacker used to access “more extensive account details” for some of the trading platform’s accounts. The heavily redacted screenshots show that hackers had access to buttons labeled “Disable MFA” (multi-factor authentication) and “Add to Trusted Device Email Code Whitelist,” along with information about what devices were logged into the account, and the ACH bank transfers the user had done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVKn04"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; says it got the screenshots from someone claiming to be affiliated with the hackers and says that Robinhood denied that hackers made any actual changes to any accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wP8wEQW--qftTk8XMNDu6QW5sYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003306/1636570231635_robintopublish.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One of the screenshots reportedly provided by the Robinhood hackers. Redactions were made by &lt;/em&gt;Motherboard&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xfuqc1"&gt;Although data was accessed for around 7 million people, Robinhood said &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident"&gt;in its announcement&lt;/a&gt; that most of them only had their email addresses or full names obtained. Ten people, however, had “more extensive account details revealed.” Robinhood confirmed the account included in one screenshot &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; received showing a customer support conversation was one of those 10. Another screenshot also shows a customer’s account balance, portfolio value, and verified phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn60b5"&gt;Robinhood &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770861/robinhood-7-million-customers-hacker-breach-extortion-security"&gt;announced the hack on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, saying that someone was able to socially engineer one of its support employees and gain access to some of the company’s customer support tools. These tools gave them access to some user information, though not Social Security, bank, or debit card numbers, according to Robinhood. The company won’t say if the users who had more data accessed than others were specifically targeted, but it has said that it’s reaching out to those affected. Robinhood also said that the hacker tried to extort it for money, but that it didn’t pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUi7UU"&gt;Robinhood didn’t immediately respond to request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elden Ring hands-on: an open world so pretty you won’t mind dying a lot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xt-db1CboZpev4HmsRC7TqtcodA=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70124038/elden_ring_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Let me climb the tree, Elden Ring&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="bLIE0D"&gt;My journey through the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; closed network preview started in a dark cave. Instead of following the obvious path out of the cave in front of me, I veered toward what looked to be a bottomless cliff on my right, just to see what I could see. It wasn’t bottomless; instead I could see flickering light at what was likely a fatal distance below. But before my logical brain could remind me, “There’s fall damage in &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; games, you know,” my curious squirrel brain propelled me over the cliff where I landed undamaged. I let out a surprised and delighted little squeak and was on my way. That was my main source of excitement from &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring, &lt;/em&gt;after playing for 10-ish hours. The Lands Between are peppered with so many nooks and crannies begging to be discovered that it’s possible to have a radically different experience each time you play. I lent part of my playtime to my &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt;-loving partner and our two playthroughs were so different, it was like we played two different games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmgwz0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; looks like FromSoftware decided to ditch the unique conventions of &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice&lt;/em&gt; to return to the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; formula that made the studio famous. The UI is virtually indistinguishable from &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/em&gt;. You’ve got quick items in four quadrants in the bottom left of your screen, the number of runes (&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;’s level-up currency) in the  bottom right, and your health, stamina, and focus (mana) bars in the top left. When you beat a boss, the world darkens as golden letters appear letting you know, “Foe Defeated.” If you’re familiar with FromSoftware games, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; will look like the bones of a &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; game in a much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; prettier skin suit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/85IesPDJO55Nx-EtW7fFRkAP26A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003207/elden_ring_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ahM9Sb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; feels warmer than &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, the color palette reminding me of the last rays of sunlight right before a torrential rain. It’s not a sunny game although there are day and night cycles, but the bright yellows, shiny golds, and lush greens make it feel lighter and more hopeful than previous FromSoftware titles. You play a Tarnished, which sounds unsavory, but instead of feeling like the foul and corrupted damned as I did in &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, I am pretty damn confident about my chances of finding the shards of the titular Elden Ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08oCpm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; adds a lot of quality-of-life improvements not typical to &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; games. The sites of grace that heal you also guide you where to go in case the open world gets too overwhelming. An expansive map system lets you mark important places like the location of merchants or roaming bosses to avoid. You can find or buy items that let you summon spirits that help you kill enemies or distract bosses. And when you die, you can choose to resurrect at the last site of grace you activated or a special statue you’ve passed, potentially saving you from an arduous re-tread through a difficult area. But for all these conveniences, &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; isn’t an easier &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt;-experience. You’re gonna get the crap kicked out of you — a lot. But the game seems to want to make your experience a little less frustrating when you inevitably do have the tar beaten out of you multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7gXmbH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re gonna get the crap kicked out of you — a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFkBBn"&gt;For my&lt;em&gt; Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; adventure, I chose the magic-focused prophet class. In addition to a healing spell and a weapon spell that grants you healing and armor while you’re within its range, you also start with the Beast Claw spell that pretty much one-shots everything not a boss but takes so long to wind up, you’ll die before it strikes. I’m sure I could have probably done more to enhance my survivability by wearing better armor or using better spells, but I was in love with the spell and determined to make it work despite its fatal weakness. That openness is what hooked me on &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;. It plops you into a beautiful, open world giving you a blank canvas of a class and says, “Okay, make it work.” So I did, concocting an elaborate dodging and weaving strategy that would hopefully preserve my life while ensuring the spell hit home. I beat a couple of bosses that way, and those I couldn’t beat, I just found somewhere else to explore instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpWtn7"&gt;My favorite location was a dungeon composed of a network of catacombs. It was filled with fire traps that killed me unless I was at full health and quick little bastard enemies that clung to the walls unseen and fell on top of me, ripping me apart with unfathomably fast strikes. Misjudge the distance to a gout of flame? Death. Fail to check your corners like a soldier breaching a compound? Death. Yet, despite losing a dragon’s hoard of 1,300 runes and screaming so loud my dog thought I was dying,&lt;em&gt; Elden Ring,&lt;/em&gt; with its freedom of exploration, made death feel like a puzzle to solve and not a punishment for carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRYp5TluL409e6Y170HzgeJbNTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003209/elden_ring_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s6330K"&gt;At the first site of grace I found after beating the boss at the end of my not-bottomless-pit dungeon, I was greeted by a snickering shithead who told me I was better off dying in a ditch because I was “maidenless.” After leaving him and his condescension behind, I wandered The Lands Between, dodging a heavily armored mounted asshole and sucking up runes from tiny, woodland creatures and sheep who have the awesome ability to curl up and roll away a la Samus’ Morph Ball. I found a second site of grace and after activating it, a tattooed woman named Melina greeted me, offering an accord. She pledged to be my maiden, the level-up lady FromSoftware games are fond of, and gave me Torrent, a spirit horse, to help me navigate the vast Lands Between. After spending time with Torrent, gleefully mowing down enemies with my Beast Claw from horseback which I was surprised and delighted to find the game allowed me to do, I returned to the snickering shithead, no longer maidenless, and dueled him to death. Felt good, righteous even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhTV0w"&gt;After spending several hours with &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, the thought my mind returns to, long after the closed network test session ended is, “Can I climb the golden tree?” I never got close to those trees. I survived a fall through a deadly chasm, rode a ghost horse into battle, and got some good old-fashioned revenge — but I never got close to those trees. They tower above the open, expansive landscape, glowing a pretty yellow gold and calling to me to scale their many branches like a beacon. This is &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, a FromSoftware game in which the appeal ostensibly lies in beating punishing enemies and boss fights. But, when presented with such a beautiful, melancholic open world and a trusty, double-jumping spirit horse to navigate it all, all I want to do is climb the tree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv7pca"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; launches on PlayStation and Xbox February 25th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will soon let you pass on your iCloud data when you die </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBZI9ivVRiNFnV9ZrEB2Al6OUiE=/375x0:4422x2698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123890/Claim_Request___iPad.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Digital Legacy program lets users choose up to five people who can access their iCloud account when they pass away.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xZ0p1D"&gt;Apple is solving a complicated problem with its latest iOS update: right of survivorship. Until now, when a loved one or family member dies, there was no easy way to access their iCloud account and absolutely no way of unlocking their phone without knowing their passcode. According to the&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/legal/internet-services/icloud/en/terms.html"&gt; iCloud terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, the deceased person’s data goes with them even with a death certificate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0yJO5"&gt;With the new Digital Legacy program, first announced at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__youtu.be_0TD96VTf0Xs-3Ft-3D3250&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=HTakECkqD13F_4No8TePr7snOg-TM_Z0bAqwspVK1Ig&amp;amp;m=fItzX2rODQv7RTBNSewxVHMkya7KOGU1oXhxAzEMZPr6hl7x3l__BXbSpMvo-Oet&amp;amp;s=C1TZjvKT6GLXL0Ujl0iCXyP3v_KcOvP9Mlxi4sdZ8NY&amp;amp;e="&gt;WWDC earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and arriving in iOS 15.2, you can designate up to five people as Legacy Contacts. These individuals can then access your data and personal information stored in iCloud when you die, such as photos, documents, and even purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTcY2F"&gt;To activate Digital Legacy, Apple still requires proof of death and an access key. Still, it’s a much more simplified process than before, which could require a court order confirming a right to inheritance, and even then, there was no guarantee you would get access to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsBjJm"&gt;This has been a complicated situation for Apple, which has long touted its core principles of protecting users’ privacy. &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/04/01/technology/leonardo-fabbretti-apple/index.html"&gt;Grieving parents&lt;/a&gt; and spouses railing against the company for not giving them access to their spouses’ photos isn’t a good look. But neither is doling out people’s data willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OicCfd"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/991335594313139"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have systems in place for designating account access to other people, and it’s good to see Apple catching up here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/940cfO0OkQ_5sDIpdxvW-ApWX20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003129/Legacy_Contact_Setup___iPhone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set up your Legacy Contacts in Settings on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="cGLS0b"&gt;How to set up a Legacy Contact &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="4J6udT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note you need to be running iOS 15.2 to access this feature)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QNxQyr"&gt;On an iOS device, go to Settings &amp;gt; [your name] &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mLmW5J"&gt;On a Mac, go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; Password &amp;amp; Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oIRNAU"&gt;Under Legacy Contact, follow the instructions to add a Legacy Contact. If you use Family Sharing, you can choose a family member from the list; alternatively, add someone using their email or phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CD5ZzW"&gt;Notify your Legacy Contact and share an access key via Messages. If they accept, a copy of the access key is automatically stored in their Apple ID settings. If they decline, you will receive a notification. The access key is required to get into your account if you pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRSBZY"&gt;While you can add a Legacy Contact who isn’t on iOS 15.2, they won’t be able to store the access key in the settings on their device, so you should provide it to them in another way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uspE8A"&gt;Legacy Contact is part of the Digital Legacy program and is available now in the public beta version of iOS 15.2 for iPhone. It will be broadly accessible when iOS 15.2 fully launches. Apple hasn’t said which version of macOS will support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltlITw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YLU1nQ"&gt;No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed: the most important measures are comfort, how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, and whether they support multipoint pairing so you can connect to two audio sources at once. The right headphones for you will differ based on which of those things you prioritize, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a good mix of sound quality, everyday durability, and great noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XtIOrp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlNC4"&gt;But if you’re looking for something a bit different, there are still plenty of options. If you want supreme comfort during those long-haul flights, Bose’s QuietComfort 45s are the answer. If you’re an iPhone owner and will only settle for the best, the AirPods Max live up to their price. But Sennheiser and Shure also sell some tremendous ANC headphones if sound quality is your main focus. Trying to find the best headphones for Zoom life? Microsoft and Bose both have strong contenders. And if you’re after something a little more stylish, Marshall’s headphones just might surprise you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 headphones remain the overall best noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FIBBVA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e21VnC"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="49SoTG"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 might look identical to the previous 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjKN0Y"&gt;Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings. Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it’s still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the marathon 30-hour battery life. But Sony addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued into what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iloOp"&gt;Sony also has a really unique trick for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you’ve started talking, which is handy when you’re grabbing a coffee. And unlike their predecessors, the 1000XM4s can tell when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause. They still cost the same hefty $350, but you’re getting more for your money with the 1000XM4s than before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zwdkfG"&gt;The most comfortable noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZQ58k"&gt;Bose’s QC45 headphones are a return to form in the best way. They have a design that’s very similar to the QC35II, meaning they’re remarkably light and comfortable on your head even when worn for an entire day. The oval ear cups never fatigue your ears, and no one can match Bose when it comes to comfort. Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded to make them easier to travel with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PcpUoW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZDlqa"&gt;Bose made modest improvements to the active noise cancellation and stretched battery life to 24 hours from the previous 20. The QC45s also have a USB-C port instead of the Micro USB connector of their predecessors. And they add a transparency mode for when you need to have a quick chat with someone or want more awareness of your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTkhOA"&gt;Sound quality on the QC45s is a little more even-handed than the bassy Sony 1000XM4s. And unfortunately, Bose doesn’t offer EQ customization for these headphones at the moment. Another frustration is that there’s no way to turn off noise cancellation without activating the transparency mode. It’s one or the other with no basic “off” mode. I’m still hoping Bose will address both of these shortcomings with future software updates, but you shouldn’t count on that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t come cheap, but they’re the best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TSER3c"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;Apple AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b7jGRn"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AXEBd8"&gt;There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KK007J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2d4O3y"&gt;The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver the best audio quality you can get from high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage, fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. Apple’s noise cancellation is right up there with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow that daunting price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVlWWZ"&gt;But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="yj00sX"&gt;The best sounding noise-canceling headphones if you’re not an Apple user&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rqLSMi"&gt;If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation. Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort. The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hSuEdn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGZqkd"&gt;If you’re a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C. They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials. That premium feel does demand a bit more, with both of these selling for the same $400 price tag. Their noise-canceling isn’t on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i7fV4Q"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GtniNJ"&gt;With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made noticeable improvements to sound quality and battery life. After you’ve gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you’ll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dI25d6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PsR02w"&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you’re at work on your PC. Something about the way Microsoft handles simultaneous Bluetooth connections seems more reliable and consistent than what everyone else is doing. It’s rare that I encounter any bugs when connected to two devices at once. It’s hard to oversell this benefit during work-at-home life, and you get the convenience for much less cash than the Sony or Bose headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OJVxE6"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tdSxzI"&gt;Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned. They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness. It’s really a flip of the coin between these and Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many. Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose’s support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus. The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren’t as feather-light as the company’s less expensive QC35 II headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2PK7eH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TYQUm"&gt;When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you’ll be heard loud and clear by whoever’s on the other end, which can’t be said for all wireless headphones on this list. Bose’s microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here. Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones have a stylish design that ties into the company’s history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mtvtN5"&gt;7. Marshall Monitor II ANC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DO2V4l"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F7quUY"&gt;Marshall’s wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company’s most expensive pair is also its best yet. The Monitor II ANC headphones are priced at $320, which puts them on the same playing field as Bose, Sony, and other tech companies that have been making premium noise-canceling cans for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7uR3"&gt;Marshall doesn’t quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise. But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company’s heritage. The headphones fold up for easy carrying, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/24/18018074/marshall-joystick-headphone-button-control-audio-bluetooth-wireless"&gt;Marshall’s signature gold joystick&lt;/a&gt; makes the Monitor IIs simple to control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6QyVt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361724"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wFNLUi"&gt;They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you’re already someplace quiet and can do without the feature. That impressive longevity beats our primary picks. A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I’ve enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I’ve put them on. They’re more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing a Take a Break feature</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCIIeqMVYzyGtIEBrmb6249_ICM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123523/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram is testing a Take a Break feature to get you off the app | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RAaowz"&gt;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri said Wednesday that the platform is testing the long-awaited Take a Break feature to give users reminders when they’ve spent a long time on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnJUDv"&gt;“It does what you think it does,” Mosseri said in a video posted to Twitter. “If you opt in, it encourages you to take a break from Instagram after you spend a certain amount of time on the app; 10, 20, or 30 minutes,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dBSa93"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Testing “Take a Break”  ‍ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We started testing a new feature called “Take a Break” this week. This opt-in control enables you to receive break reminders in-app after a duration of your choosing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m excited to dig into the results &amp;amp; hopefully launch this sometime in December. ✌  &lt;a href="https://t.co/WdSTjL6ZdH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WdSTjL6ZdH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jrDUFf"&gt;The feature is “part of a broader effort to try and give people more control over their experience of Instagram,” Mosseri added. “Ultimately, you know what’s best for you when it comes to how you use the app. And we want to make sure we provide tools for you to shape Instagram into what works for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRCFio"&gt;The testing of a Take a Break feature comes amid intense scrutiny on Instagram and its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook) after whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about the company’s internal research that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;showed Instagram can have a negative effect on the mental health of young people&lt;/a&gt;. Teenagers told the company’s researchers that they felt “addicted” to Instagram but didn’t have the self-control to reduce their usage even though they would have preferred to check the app less often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG6Yyc"&gt;The company’s vice president of global affairs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook"&gt;Nick Clegg, said on CNN&lt;/a&gt; last month that it was working on the Take a Break feature along with similar features, all with teenagers in mind. When its systems “see that a teenager is looking at the same content over and over again, and it’s content which may not be conducive to their well being, we will nudge them to look at other content,” Clegg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TS75NZ"&gt;A company spokesperson confirmed that users will have to opt in to the feature to activate it but said in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it would be “sending teens a notification urging them to turn it on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1WBkCi"&gt;The glimpses of the feature in Mosseri’s video show the prompt will display in users’ feeds but won’t take over the entire screen. So, in theory, someone could scroll right past it. If they choose “turn on,” they’ll then be prompted to choose what length of time they want to spend on the app before they receive the reminder. The reminder will then pop up with a list of suggestions: “take a few deep breaths, write down what you’re thinking, listen to your favorite song, do something on your to-do list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR9QQu"&gt;Mosseri said Instagram worked with third-party experts for advice on what tips to offer and how to frame taking a break. If the company is “comfortable” with the feature, it could launch wider next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All I want from my smartwatch is to give me a break</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s rings are a good motivator, until they aren’t&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HD0wue"&gt;If there’s one thing wearable makers learned during the pandemic, it’s that people are stressed out — and with good reason. It’s led to companies like Fitbit and Apple expanding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295768/fitbit-premium-mindful-method-deepak-chopra-wellness-series"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/fitness-plus-introduces-workouts-and-meditations-with-shareplay/"&gt;mindfulness features&lt;/a&gt; in their most recent products and services. But while it’s encouraging to see wearables makers acknowledge that mental health is part of overall health, there’s still one major oversight: modern wearables are fundamentally centered around building and maintaining streaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyNY0e"&gt;Whether it’s hitting your daily 10,000 steps, burning a certain number of calories, or reminders to move every hour, the aim for most wearables is to help you build better health habits. To do that, consistency is key. No one’s denying that. But any athlete or doctor will also tell you that &lt;a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_importance_of_rest_and_recovery_for_athletes#:~:text=Rest%20and%20recovery%20is%20an,especially%20for%20high%20level%20athletes.&amp;amp;text=The%20body%20is%20allowed%20to,the%20body%20tissue%20to%20repair."&gt;rest and recovery are incredibly important&lt;/a&gt; to your overall health, preventing injuries, and avoiding motivational burnout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb9C6C"&gt;Unfortunately, most wearables fail at giving you a break, even when it’s justified. It’s simply not built into their programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yLq0e"&gt;Take the Apple Watch. Apple’s Fitness app revolves around closing three rings: the Move ring for calories burned, Exercise for minutes spent being active, and Stand for how many hours you stand in a day. In the Awards section, you can earn badges like “Longest Move Streak” and “Perfect Week” for each ring. Essentially, you’re rewarded for meeting daily goals over a long period of time — regardless of whether that’s what your body and mind needs at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caEzOFrtaO72sIyHt6vDZ79ve1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13111179/vpavic_180917_2949_0062.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch prioritizes consistency above all else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lyjizD"&gt;Apple’s not the only one guilty of this. Fitbit, Garmin, and every other fitness tracker under the sun also use gamification as a motivational tool. While it can feel amazing when you’re in the zone, it can ironically be demotivating when you break a streak for reasons outside your control. And the longer the streak, the more demotivating it becomes when you inevitably break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNri9l"&gt;Being a wearables reviewer means I’m hyper consistent with a training schedule. However, even I occasionally fall ill, get injured, or have a major life event that necessitates falling off the horse for an extended period of time. In those instances, it’d be more useful if I could just hit a “pause” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tqnkc"&gt;Earlier this year, I got too caught up in keeping a streak going, which in turn led me to ignore signs I was overdoing my training. The result was a nasty case of shin splints. Common sense dictated I lay off my regimen until I was fully healed. That said, it was hard not to feel the sting of breaking a 90-day streak even though I was doing the best thing for my health. This scenario isn’t rare. Peruse any smartwatch or fitness forum and you’ll find people &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/bza8ye/apple_watch_on_sick_days/"&gt;fretting about streaks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://forums.garmin.com/sports-fitness/healthandwellness/f/vivoactive-3-3-music/270906/are-you-ever-gonna-fix-the-10-000-steps-streak-issue"&gt;obsessing over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/l9tqou/i_misplaced_my_smart_watch_charger_and_now_my/"&gt;losing “credit”&lt;/a&gt; for an arbitrary goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="61g0Yr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fitbit moved away from arbitrary step counts and now prioritizes minutes of activity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwgUyR"&gt;This isn’t to say wearables companies and fitness apps aren’t moving in the right direction. With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Fitbit Charge 4&lt;/a&gt;, the company moved away from its arbitrary 10,000-step goal toward a new metric called &lt;a href="https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1379.htm"&gt;Active Zone Minutes (AZM)&lt;/a&gt;. What made this shift notable is AZM focuses on your weekly activity level, as opposed to daily streaks. This year, the company also added something it calls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22765408/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-electrocardiogram-app-daily-readiness-score"&gt;a Daily Readiness Score&lt;/a&gt;, which helps users decide how active they should be based on their body’s signals and prior activity. In watchOS 6, Apple added a Trends tab that contextualized your progress over the past 90 days compared to your yearly average. This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8 update&lt;/a&gt; also added a host of mindfulness tools, but they’re more focused on meditation than recovery. (The Apple Watch’s native sleep tracking also still leaves a lot to be desired.) These are all steps in the right direction, but most mainstream wearables still don’t have a way to stay motivated without penalizing you for needing a physical or mental break every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmqYer"&gt;The wearable that comes closest is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740187/oura-period-prediction-heart-rate-smart-ring"&gt;recovery-focused Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt;. It defines a “good” activity score as hitting a calorie goal three to four times a week, and last year, it added a new &lt;a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/ouras-new-rest-mode-helps-optimize-your-recovery/"&gt;Rest Mode&lt;/a&gt;. In Rest Mode, the ring snoozes your activity goals and readjusts your scores to prioritize recovery. But the Oura Ring is also a niche health wearable that lacks many of the smart features people have come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkVTL6"&gt;Smartwatches and fitness trackers can be excellent tools for anyone looking to build better habits. But people aren’t machines, and they don’t need to be shamed for breaking streaks or losing some fitness during a recovery period. This is doubly true for those dealing with life’s tribulations. No one wants to get a reminder to move when they’re at a funeral or going through a rough time. You should be able to hit a button that pauses streaks, mutes motivational reminders, and ideally, automatically sets easier goals based on your metrics when you’re finally ready to get back to your usual routine. Maybe then, people would feel less inclined to give up and let their trackers collect dust in a drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam Deck launch delayed by two months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQXkPMe7D2SBY00KrWBONjROKNc=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123395/steam_deck.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck, which has been delayed to February.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGLGPc"&gt;Valve is delaying the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, its handheld gaming PC, by two months. The Steam Deck had been set to launch in December, but Valve now estimates that the first orders will start shipping in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwTjy"&gt;“We’re sorry about this — we did our best to work around the global supply chain issues, but due to material shortages, components aren’t reaching our manufacturing facilities in time for us to meet our initial launch dates,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712"&gt;Valve said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wjuL3"&gt;One editor at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is now seeing a Q1 2022 estimated ship date for a Steam Deck reservation that was originally slated for the December launch window. Another is seeing a Q2 2022 estimated ship date for an order that was initially going to arrive in Q1. (Both placed their reservation on the very first day that Valve opened preorders.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PtYohDgb_-iSBF6qSjyR17_-8fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003117/image__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve is still showing “After Q2 2022” for new orders, the same as it showed yesterday, but the initial shipments have been bumped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Alj37E"&gt;The global supply chain shortage has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;massive impact&lt;/a&gt; on the technology industry. Next-gen consoles and Nvidia 30-series graphics cards have been famously difficult to buy for going on a year, BMW said last week that some new cars won’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;touchscreens because of chip shortages&lt;/a&gt;, and even Apple has felt the sting, saying that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;lost $6 billion&lt;/a&gt; to supply chain constraints in its most recent quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKNjBk"&gt;“While we did our best to account for the global supply chain issues (by which we mean we factored in extra time to account for these risks and worked with multiple component vendors), our manufacturing plans were still impacted,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;Valve said in the Steam Deck FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. “Material shortages and delays meant that components weren’t making it to our manufacturing facilities on time. Missing parts along with logistical challenges means delayed Steam Decks, so we needed to push out shipping by two months to February.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r3TkdI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iwlPqw"&gt;Chip shortages aren’t the only thing Valve is squaring away before the Steam Deck’s launch — it’s also trying to ensure developers flip any necessary switches and make any necessary modifications to ensure their Windows games run on the Linux handheld. A Proton compatibility layer does most of the heavy lifting, but online multiplayer games sometimes come with anti-cheat software that historically didn’t work well with Proton, and games may want to embrace the Deck’s touchscreen, joysticks, and buttons as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta8xwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733408/steam-deck-compatibility-verified-pc-gaming-valve"&gt;Valve introduced a “Verified” program last month&lt;/a&gt; for games that work well on Deck and has worked with top anti-cheat platforms Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) and BattlEye to enable support. EAC owner Epic Games says flipping on support takes just a few clicks on the developer end; Valve says BattlEye is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege"&gt;as easy as sending an email&lt;/a&gt;. Despite that, some top Steam game developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709918/valve-steam-deck-supported-games-anti-cheat-proton-eac-battleye-epic"&gt;haven’t yet been willing to voice support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD8p59"&gt;Valve is holding &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017?emclan=103582791433666425&amp;amp;emgid=3104662546549776336"&gt;a virtual developer event on Friday&lt;/a&gt; for the Steam Deck, sharing best practices and answering developer questions. The company already sent out early Steam Deck units to developers months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZzJiD7"&gt;

    <title>Uber discriminates against people with disabilities, new DOJ lawsuit alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5WCcTIzQFzaJWh5uWeZAs9EBLE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123274/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWObmA"&gt;Uber discriminates against people with disabilities by charging them a “wait time” fee while entering the vehicle, according to a new lawsuit filed by the US Justice Department against the ride-hailing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa9oqJ"&gt;These extra fees have “harmed many passengers and potential passengers with disabilities throughout the country,” some of whom may be entitled to monetary damages, the department said. The lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for Northern California, alleges that Uber is in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination by private transportation companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzFsgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Passengers would incur the fee two minutes after their Uber car arrives at their pickup location&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8oqEpI"&gt;According to the Justice Department, Uber instituted a wait time fee in a number of cities starting in April 2016, eventually expanding the policy nationwide. Passengers would incur the fee two minutes after their Uber car arrives at their pickup location and were charged until the car begins its trip. Passengers with disabilities, such as those who use a wheelchair or a walker, often need more time to get into the car than passengers without disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXH6R"&gt;“People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-uber-overcharging-people-disabilities"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. Clarke said the goal of the lawsuit is to send a “powerful message that Uber cannot penalize passengers with disabilities simply because they need more time to get into a car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuFsEO"&gt;Matt Kallman, a spokesperson for Uber, called the lawsuit “surprising and confusing” in light of Uber’s desire to work with the Justice Department to address confusion around its wait time fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCVLnX"&gt;“We fundamentally disagree that our policies violate the ADA and will keep improving our products to support everyone’s ability to easily move around their communities,” Kallman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5vQT50"&gt;Kallman said it was Uber’s policy to refund wait time fees for disabled riders whenever they alerted the company that they were charged. And Uber changed its policies recently so that any rider “who certifies they are disabled” will have fees automatically waived, Kallman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wnuah"&gt;Despite these changes, Uber has a fairly abysmal record when it comes to serving its passengers with disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15888508/uber-equal-rights-center-lawsuit-wheelchair-accessibility-uberx"&gt;The company was sued by disability advocates&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, in which it was accused of denying equal access to people who use wheelchairs and violating the ADA. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384600/uber-lyft-wheelchair-accessible-fail-nyc-report"&gt;A report detailed&lt;/a&gt; excessively long wait times for wheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAV) in New York City. And Uber sued New York City to block the implementation of a new rule requiring ride-hailing companies to make wheelchair-accessible service a part of their operations. (The company and the city later &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/06/13/new-york-city-and-uber-reach-settlement-on-wheelchair-accessibility-466459"&gt;agreed to a settlement&lt;/a&gt; exempting Uber and Lyft from the WAV requirement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VOkCN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber has a fairly abysmal record when it comes to serving its passengers with disabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrlDxd"&gt;Uber has also faced civil action over its poor record serving customers with disabilities. A lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/uber-ride-share-wheelchair-access-disabled-suit-allegheny-pittsburgh-20190614.html"&gt;filed in Pennsylvania in 2019&lt;/a&gt; accused the company of failing to ensure that people in wheelchairs receive equal service from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6CEIM"&gt;A federal lawsuit obviously raises the legal stakes for Uber. The Justice Department is not only seeking monetary damages for affected passengers but also a court order forcing the company to comply with the ADA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QSyLG"&gt;The lawsuit references a 52-year-old woman from Miami with a spinal injury who uses a motorized wheelchair, detailing how it would take on average five minutes or longer for her to board an Uber vehicle. The woman noticed that she was incurring fees for the added time but was denied a refund from Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnt1V5"&gt;The woman, who is only referred to as “Passenger A,” “felt angry and upset that Uber has charged her wait time fees for her daily rides to her rehabilitation appointments,” the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.gov/uber_comp.pdf"&gt;lawsuit states&lt;/a&gt;. “Uber’s refusal to refund her money or to change its wait time fee policy makes Passenger A feel like a second-class citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIHj5F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 10th, 4:03PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include a statement from an Uber spokesperson. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is making it easier to share your screen in Microsoft Teams and other video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pyOMePO74E8d32_DTdfmVFNsfo=/0x0:1332x888/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123056/Share_any_window_zoomZoom2X.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams share buttons will appear in Windows 11 soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3GFgBI"&gt;Microsoft is adding a useful new Microsoft Teams integration into Windows 11 soon. The software maker has started testing a feature in Windows 11 that will allow Teams users to hover over open windows on the taskbar and quickly share the window content on a Microsoft Teams call. It will make screen sharing a lot easier for Teams and other communication apps on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dtp59a"&gt;Microsoft is testing this initially with Microsoft Teams for work or school rather than the built-in consumer version of Teams in Windows 11. “This means not everyone will see this right away with their Teams calls,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/10/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22499/"&gt;says Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, head of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program. “We plan to bring this to Chat from Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams for home) later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vDxRoH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zoom, Slack, and others will be free to add this integration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ2SPB"&gt;The good news is that this won’t be limited to Microsoft Teams, either. “Other communications applications can also add this capability to their applications,” explains Langowski. “The capability to share your meeting call applies only to your current meeting call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TTVdV"&gt;That means apps like Slack or Zoom could build this functionality into their apps and make it a lot easier for Windows 11 users to share what’s on their screen during video calls. It’s not clear exactly when Microsoft will deliver this functionality in Windows 11, but it’s likely to appear in early 2022, given the timing of testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Zd3R"&gt;Microsoft is also only testing this with a subset of Windows Insiders, so having the Dev Channel builds of Windows 11 installed doesn’t guarantee you’ll be able to test it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
