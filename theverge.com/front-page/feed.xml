    <title>Sony’s PlayStation 5 is available at Target</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ivqFA7"&gt;If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you want another shot at trying to buy Sony’s next-gen console, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$500 PS5 console&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a disc drive right now at Target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ8ICJ"&gt;It is important to note that Target only has the console available at select locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9jxWc9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igu8hA"&gt;If you are one of the lucky ones to secure your unit in the latest restocks, I have a few suggestions on some additional items you may want to buy. You’ll likely want to buy some games for your new console. The PS5 is home to some of the most popular titles right now, such as 2020 remake of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fdemons-souls%2F11108202.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some other fun games like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Spider-Man-Miles-Morales-Launch-PlayStation/dp/B08FC66ZV4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FS5HKTR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q9bLmP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10325914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yurQ39"&gt;Some games require an online subscription to play, so &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a good purchase. But you’re not just paying to play most games (excluding free-to-play titles) online, as PS5 users with an active PS Plus subscription also have access to a digital library of PS4 classics thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPmYRp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVN6DU"&gt;If you are looking to buy a new TV that will take advantage of the next-gen hardware, Best Buy has a deal on a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735709730352278220#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch 4K OLED on sale for $1,500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZgHLjV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="HRiiTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q3JMkC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The UK’s new £50 note celebrates Alan Turing with lots of geeky Easter eggs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pFjxO7HtpygnJvcHjILVIoDTWpo=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69023270/1200x800_New50.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rvdHox"&gt;The Bank of England has &lt;a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/march/the-new-50-note-unveiled"&gt;revealed the design&lt;/a&gt; for the UK’s new £50 note featuring computer scientist and codebreaker Alan Turing. Turing was selected to appear on the note in July 2019 in recognition of his groundbreaking work in mathematics and computer science, as well as his role in cracking the Enigma code used by Germany in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZtMr6"&gt;The polymer note will enter circulation from June 23 this year, and incorporates a &lt;a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer-50-pound-note"&gt;number of designs&lt;/a&gt; linked to Turing’s life and legacy. These include technical drawings for the bombe, a decryption device used during WWII; a string of ticker tape with Turing’s birthday rendered in binary (23 June 1912); a green and gold security foil resembling a microchip; and a table and mathematical formulae taken from one of Turing’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing%27s_proof"&gt;most famous papers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EWWKel"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turing was prosecuted by the UK government in 1952 for ‘gross indecency’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eFpOP9"&gt;As well as honoring his scientific achievements, Turing was also selected to appear on the bank note in recognition of his persecution by the UK government for homosexuality. Turing was openly gay among friends, but in 1952 was arrested and charged with “gross indecency” for homosexual acts, which were illegal in England and Wales until 1967. Despite changes to the law, prosecution of same-sex acts &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/23/fifty-years-gay-liberation-uk-barely-four-1967-act"&gt;continued in the UK&lt;/a&gt; for decades afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjvHL3"&gt;Turing did not deny the charges and was convicted and sentenced to chemical castration. He &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130120024901/http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html"&gt;wrote in a letter&lt;/a&gt; before he was charged: “No doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I’ve not found out.” He died two years later at the age of 41 after eating an apple laced with cyanide. Historians still &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092"&gt;disagree&lt;/a&gt; over whether this was suicide or a case of accidental poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eaFp3oJ7FFAshnQQKKDQy-lwv6A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396461/s_50_note___back.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note features a photograph of Turing in front of technical drawings for the bombe machine and a photograph of the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) Pilot Machine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cr98GdZ9mffGkVoYw_qzCMK8AZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396473/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_10.53.05_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turing’s birthday (23 June 1912) is rendered in binary on ticker tape, a format Turing thought could be used to enter data into machines. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrqWFbi9pYivvSHJMIprO9dzc5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396474/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_10.53.18_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The table and mathematical formulae come from Turing’s seminal 1936 paper “On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem,” which introduced the concept of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BeLiPErHi7c3m0sc8uOJYAfhPXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396476/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_10.56.54_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Turing’s signature is taken from the visitor’s book at Bletchley Park, and the quote from an interview given to &lt;/em&gt;The Times&lt;em&gt; on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8mvVrrieQczOaPnRvQWE6-9KNW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396477/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_10.58.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note’s traditional security foil has been altered to resemble the design of a microchip, while the spiral sunflower patterns pay homage to Turing’s work in morphogenetics. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ca1BB4CNJcsWvLmkBn37j4zziF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22396460/s_50_note___front.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bank of England&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the note features standard elements for UK bank notes, including a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ndiUcM"&gt;Turing and tens of thousands of other men convicted of the same offenses were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_law#:~:text=The%20%22Alan%20Turing%20law%22%20is,legislation%20that%20outlawed%20homosexual%20acts.&amp;amp;text=Turing%20received%20a%20royal%20pardon%20(posthumously)%20in%202013."&gt;posthumously pardoned&lt;/a&gt; from 2017 following a 10-year campaign led by former MP John Leech. Leech &lt;a href="https://aboutmanchester.co.uk/turing-on-50-note-will-be-painful-reminder-of-what-we-lost/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the treatment of Turing was a “national embarrassment and an example of society at its absolute worst,” and that selecting him to appear on the £50 note would at least bring his life and works to public attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2aclU"&gt;“It is almost impossible to put into words the difference that Alan Turing made to society, but perhaps the most poignant example is that his work is estimated to have shortened the war by four years and saved 21 million lives,” said Leech in 2018. “Placing Turing on the £50 note would at least go some way to acknowledging his unprecedented contribution to society and science. But more importantly it will serve as a stark and frankly painful reminder of what we lost in Turing and what we will lose again if we ever allow that kind of hateful ideology to win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWPoQ1"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1374977788244017153"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Turing’s nephew Sir Dermot Turing said that there was still much work to be done to truly honor Turing’s legacy. “I think Alan Turing would have wanted us to think about things like under-representation of women in science subjects; under-representation of Black and ethnic minority kids in STEM subjects in school, and why they’re not being given the opportunities they should have and why that’s bad for all of us.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bang &amp; Olufsen’s new HX headphones offer 35 hours of battery life for $499 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpmpTHMNPP7QBdCxwJVbmVZWVy8=/0x189:6000x4189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69022993/Beoplay_HX_0012.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beoplay HX headphones. | Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D8b4Zo"&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s latest pair of headphones are the Beoplay HX. They’re over-ear, noise canceling, and offer up to a truly impressive 35 hours of battery life. The headphones launch in black today for $499 (£499 / €499), but there’s a white model coming at the end of April, to be followed by a white and brown version in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MckmT7"&gt;At $499, the Beoplay HX are among the more expensive wireless noise-canceling headphones available. But this isn’t unfamiliar territory for Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen: the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14495606/beoplay-h9-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;Beoplay H9 headphones&lt;/a&gt; cost exactly the same — and this is the company that also sells &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;an $800 pair of Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lhweyn"&gt;Thirty-five hours of battery life beats pretty much all competitors (and it rises up to 40 hours if you turn ANC off). The $549 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; are rated at just 20 hours with ANC on, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;our top pick&lt;/a&gt; $350 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; can go for up to 30 hours. Others, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; or Shure Aonic are rated for 16 hours and 20 hours, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ng-anZSrTJGGJ3kBH8VPFjEe4DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22394441/Beoplay_HX_0060.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bang and Olufsen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A white and brown model is following in May.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0SV5Uq"&gt;Beyond battery life, the other thing your $499 gets you is build quality. The Beoplay HX’s ear cushions are made from lambskin with a memory foam interior, while the headband uses cow hide and knitted fabric in its construction. The ear cups themselves feature an aluminum disc surrounded by a recycled plastic housing, and the arm sliders are also aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG5IHz"&gt;The rest of the Beoplay HX specs are typical. There’s a USB-C port for charging, a 3.5mm jack for wired connections, buttons on the left and right ear cup, and also touch controls on just the right side. The headphones support Bluetooth 5.1, and for codecs, you get aptX Adaptive, AAC, and SBC. Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair are both included for easy pairing with their respective platforms. And yes, the headphones come with a 3.5mm cable in the box, unlike the AirPods Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sYBu5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Justice Department is worried about an anime monopoly after the Sony deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="attack-on-titan-season-2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kj1Ybz9KgcUWApx0vqabMpB3ZuU=/75x0:779x469/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69022099/titan.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gVwHXi"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166585/sony-buy-anime-streaming-service-crunchyroll-at-t-funimation"&gt;plan to combine Crunchyroll and Funimation&lt;/a&gt; into a streaming service to lead its anime empire seemed as simple as tossing AT&amp;amp;T a billion dollars. But now the plan is reportedly concerning enough that the US Department of Justice is extending its antitrust review of the $1.175 billion purchase into a full-on probe, according to three sources who &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sonys-hopes-of-countering-netflix-in-anime-market-delayed-by-antitrust-probe?utm_campaign=%5Brtsu%5D+Automated+RTS&amp;amp;utm_content=1003171&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=cio&amp;amp;utm_term=1000266"&gt;spoke to&lt;em&gt; The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zlm2Tp"&gt;The DOJ is focused on whether the deal limits the options of Japanese studios looking to license shows in the US, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources. “WarnerMedia and Sony have told the Justice Department that Crunchyroll and Sony’s budding anime empire are just two of many options anime creators have to distribute their shows outside Japan,” &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;writes, but even if direct competition isn’t a concern, there could be other reasons to worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVVRKn"&gt;Controlling both Funimation and Crunchyroll means one thing in the context of anime streaming services in the US, but taken with all the other things Crunchyroll does, like manga publishing and anime conventions, and the international anime companies Sony already purchased &lt;a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2019/0924/sonypicturestelevisionandaniplexannounceglobalanimestreamingmerger"&gt;in Australia and France&lt;/a&gt;, the company could have a huge amount of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/21547657/sonys-funimation-acquires-crunchyroll-deal-price-watching-anime"&gt;control over the entire industry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QUy22"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21003549/anime-streaming-wars-netflix-amazon-att-sony-crunchyroll-funimation"&gt;As we wrote in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Funimation and Crunchyroll were already two of the biggest streaming anime services outside of Japan, while big players like Amazon, Netflix and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250936/hbo-max-crunchyroll-anime-netflix-amazon-funimation-fullmetal-alchemist-death-note-kill-la-kill"&gt;even the newer HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; have been beefing up their offerings with anime too. If the DOJ doesn’t block Sony’s deal and it manages to merge Crunchyroll and Funimation, Sony could very easily become the anime streaming provider to beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0Yn43"&gt;Sony, AT&amp;amp;T, and the DOJ didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgVmHC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This website that generates Beeple-esque NFTs is also an NFT and my brain is eating itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tuNBtUZyJChz0rCHJhSpA-3PpfI=/66x0:1259x795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021956/beeple6.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w6gV6D"&gt;Beeple has been one of the biggest names in NFTs, likely because some of his artwork &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;has sold for truckloads of money&lt;/a&gt;. So it was really only a matter of time before someone came along with a tool that lets you create Beeple-like artwork without having to download and pose assets yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHRtZB"&gt;(NFT? WTF? If you’re lost, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwijpvrZmcrvAhUHXc0KHXs2CMsQFjAIegQIAxAD&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310188%2Fnft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1jHPo02FamNhswM46xtCe1"&gt;here’s our NFT guide&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koBl1y"&gt;Enter BeepleGenerator.com a site that does... well, exactly what its name implies. Here’s a look at some of the... art it generated, along with some genuine Beeples for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1JE4TF"&gt;Could you sell the generated pictures as NFTs? Well... I don’t think there’s anything stopping you from listing them. But that’s thinking small — the real big brain play is to buy the site as an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q54Lbw"&gt;Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention that the site itself is for sale as an NFT? The person who currently owns it didn’t actually make it, they bought it on NFT site Zora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKNF8Q"&gt;The obvious question, besides “why” and “I want to move to a cabin in the woods” (not a question, by the way) is “what does Beeple think of this?” The answer will probably not be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The mess at Medium</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2JvxibgBYmCmw8MpgWuaMKD-Bms=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021789/VRG_ILLO_4488_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;14 current and former employees explain what went wrong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="Oz19Z7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zvLJTJ"&gt;Last week, a partnerships manager at Medium working with the White House found that there was a strange problem with the platform: President Joe Biden was being served porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG7z8d"&gt;The manager was in a video conference with a White House staffer to discuss how Biden, who had used Medium as a campaign blog in 2020, could begin posting to the official Medium @POTUS account. While sharing his screen with the White House, the staffer logged in to @POTUS and saw the first article recommended to him by Medium: “A is for After,” which a sub-headline described as “a cuckold love story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji4ygl"&gt;It’s unclear if the White House saw the story. But after the meeting, the Medium staffer tried to improve Biden’s recommendations. He followed political topics; he “read” posts by President Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris while logged in as the president. When he refreshed his recommendations, Medium recommended another piece of erotica: “Getting a Piece (and Some Pizza Too),” a story that carries the sub-headline “step sister taboo erotica.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s7Hafo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Medium had somehow added Biden as a writer on 10 “garbage publications”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhfW8z"&gt;The employee previously found that Medium had somehow added Biden as a writer on 10 “garbage publications,” as well as at least one software development blog. “President Joe Biden is Being Served Erotica on Medium.com,” the staffer complained in an internal post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGYNLG"&gt;The episode captured Medium in all its complexity: a publishing platform used by the most powerful people in the world; an experiment in mixing highbrow and lowbrow in hopes a sustainable business would emerge; and a devotion to algorithmic recommendations over editorial curation that routinely caused the company confusion and embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trXk4B"&gt;On Tuesday, it also cost dozens of journalists their jobs. In &lt;a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, billionaire Medium founder Ev Williams announced the latest pivot for the nearly nine-year old company. Just over two years into an effort to create a subscription-based bundle of publications committed to high-quality original journalism — and in the immediate aftermath of a bruising labor battle that had seen its workers fall one vote short of forming a union — Williams offered buyouts to all of its roughly 75 editorial employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grkpy1"&gt;“We have published many stellar stories that found a wide audience and more than paid for themselves,” Williams wrote. “But our hit rate has been low, and we’re not near where we need to be to make it work economically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y97IrQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;productivity porn; actual porn&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FnLZLo"&gt;Medium entered the year with more than 700,000 paid subscriptions, putting it on track for more than $35 million in revenue, according to two people familiar with the matter. That’s a healthy sum for a media company. But it represents a weak outcome for Williams, who previously sold Blogger to Google and co-founded Twitter, which eventually went public and today has a market capitalization of more than $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXCLe5"&gt;Medium has raised $132 million in venture capital, but its last funding came in 2016. Williams has been funding the company out of his own pocket since then, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu3BKN"&gt;To Williams, colleagues say, Medium is first and foremost a technology product. From the start, he has looked for ways to use journalists to bring cachet to a platform anyone can publish to. But the underlying platform has grown to include writing of every kind: viral posts about COVID-19; generic business wisdom; tech blogging; productivity porn; actual porn. Jeff Bezos used Medium to talk about &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f"&gt;the time he got blackmailed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aem3hu"&gt;Medium’s original journalism was meant to give shape and prestige to an essentially random collection of writing, gated behind a soft paywall that costs readers $5 a month or $50 a year. Eleven owned publications covered food, design, business, politics, and other subjects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H45Zwx"&gt;But in the end, frustrated that Medium staff journalists’ stories weren’t converting more free readers to paid ones, Williams moved to wind down the experiment — throwing dozens of journalists’ livelihoods into question, just as he had in 2015, when he laid off 50 people amid a pivot away from advertising on the site. (This &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/the-long-complicated-and-extremely-frustrating-history-of-medium-2012-present/"&gt;2019 history of the company by Laura Hazard Owen in &lt;em&gt;Nieman Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers a definitive look at the company’s stop-start relationship with journalism up to that point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jYgfTO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The push into original reporting was rewarded with strong growth in paid subscriptions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ1hjL"&gt;“We remain fully committed to high-quality editorial and to the open platform model that supports independent writers,” Medium told me in a statement. “The voluntary buyout reflects changes we’re making to our editorial team to create a more flexible organization that focuses on both. We see a real opportunity within our editorial operation to continue developing our model and to elevate the value we provide to our readers and writers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXXfDX"&gt;But interviews with 14 current and former Medium employees over the past day paint a portrait of a dysfunctional company built to celebrate writing only to become famous for its poor treatment of writers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOInWN"&gt;And not only writers: In recent weeks, Medium’s chief operating officer and vice president of engineering left the company. Several other engineers are leaving or planning to. Williams is now the company’s CEO, de facto COO, and since last year, its head of product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xOqy7B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="d32Be2"&gt;So what happened? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgdSPt"&gt;Like most such efforts, Medium’s renewed push into original journalism in 2018 was greeted with optimism by the reporters and editors who were hired to build the project out. One editor recounted to me the joy at being told they could pay freelancers $1 a word — more than they had been able to pay at previous jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIGsIl"&gt;The company launched publications including &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;, for tech; &lt;em&gt;Elemental&lt;/em&gt;, for health; and &lt;em&gt;Zora, &lt;/em&gt;for Black and brown women&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Over the next two years, much of its fresh, insightful journalism would be acclaimed by an industry beleaguered by layoffs. At &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;, Matt Stroud revealed that the CEO of a tech company backed by SoftBank &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/amp/p/fdba4ad32829"&gt;had once been a neo-Nazi&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the CEO’s departure from the company; “The Zora Canon,” a list of the best books written by African American women, earned coverage everywhere from NPR to the New York Public Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JVaSDQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Publication budgets were cut — and then cut again, and again&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oiyNK3"&gt;The push into original reporting was rewarded with strong growth in paid subscriptions, current and former staffers said. But journalism was rarely at the center of the company’s marketing efforts. Employees expressed frustration that the company did so little to promote their work, hampering efforts to grow their publications’ brands — particularly during the crucial early months in which readers were forming impressions of them. Publications often had only skeletal branding or visual design; some “launched” before their editors-in-chief had even been hired. (On the other hand, I’m told, Medium’s public relations team exclusively promoted owned and operated publications, as did its social media accounts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxhNcW"&gt;With millions of dollars sunk into the effort, Medium’s push into journalism represented a significant investment. But individual publications often got little attention — and what resources they did get began shrinking within months. It was too much, and too little, all at once. “We were set up to fail,” a former employee told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU4XEB"&gt;This was particularly true for publications that, like &lt;em&gt;Zora &lt;/em&gt;and its sister publication &lt;em&gt;Level&lt;/em&gt;, sought to break Medium out of its Silicon Valley bubble and reach more diverse audiences. Most of the company’s readers look like Williams: 71 percent are white, 55 percent are male, and 53 percent make more than $100,000 a year, according to internal numbers shared with me. Employees had pushed for improved diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace at least since 2018, when a white former executive repeatedly rapped the N-word during a performance of the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Big Poppa” during a company karaoke outing. The matter was investigated, and the executive eventually apologized and stayed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nZYgZ"&gt;Staffers believed it would take both significant promotion and time to reach audiences outside Medium’s mostly white Silicon Valley core. But in the end they would receive neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVPdM8"&gt;Last year — barely 12 months into the experiment — Williams had already grown uncomfortable with the cost of the team he had just built. Paid subscriptions, which had been on the rise, flatlined in 2020. Publication budgets were cut — and then cut again, and again. Editors who were lured to Medium on the promise of being able to build out full-fledged publications were suddenly begging for enough money to pay for a handful of freelance stories a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="riIINN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we’re better than Substack, we have more integrity, we’re more up front about our business model”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k1mXlB"&gt;The rest of their “publications” would comprise posts written on spec by an army of self-serve freelancers who uploaded their work to the platform in hopes it would be selected by an editor for promotion. This program, called “Amplify,” has become a core pillar of Williams’ vision for the future. Instead of paying full-time salaries and benefits to staff, Williams can use Amplify to get the content he wants at a fraction of the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3wXhj"&gt;Amplify’s writers are paid a small and essentially random fraction of subscription revenue, based on how many people read their story. In theory their financial upside is unlimited, but in practice the program pays almost no one a living wage. A venture capitalist bragged to me that he had made $25,000 on Amplify over the past 11 months — a great sum for a side hustle, but barely enough to make the rent for most writers. Certainly it could not compete with the advances offered by the upstart newsletter platform Substack, which captivated the media’s attention last year as a series of staff writers for large publications, myself included, left their jobs to write newsletters on the platform. (See my &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/platformer/Ethics-Policy-e8ee22c0ce7b4228b5da482a83b2ab76"&gt;ethics disclosure about Substack&lt;/a&gt;.)   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4amIu"&gt;Opinions vary on how threatened Williams feels by Substack, but managers often bragged about Medium’s superiority as a place to work, employees said. “Internally it has always been messaged as, ‘we’re better than Substack, we have more integrity, we’re more up front about our business model,’” one current staffer told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsDulG"&gt;Still, Medium had an answer to Substack in a program codenamed Hopscotch. Medium would pay advances to high-profile writers including the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s Susan Orlean and antitrust crusader Tim Wu to encourage them to post regularly on the platform. As with its journalism, Medium did not market the program’s existence or the writing of the participants, and it’s unclear whether Williams considers it a success. Advances paid Medium appeared to be significantly smaller than Substack offered; one source told me Orlean was paid $25,000 to write occasionally on the platform, compared to the $250,000 that Substack gave Matt Yglesias and a small number of other high-profile writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Xb5PE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;traffic successes came from search engines and social networks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="un3K5F"&gt;Williams’ investment in Amplify and Hopscotch reflected a growing interest in what he calls “relational media” — one-on-one relationships between readers and writers, mediated by the platform. In his view, relational media poses a challenge to traditional, publication-based journalism — a reason he would ultimately give for offering buyouts to his reporters. “The role of publications — in the world, not just on Medium — has decreased in the modern era,” Williams wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7oIPO"&gt;But Williams had other reasons for his declining interest in staff-led publications. Last year, aware of their sites’ budget cuts and fearful for a repeat of Medium’s 2015 layoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278684/medium-union-unionizing-communications-workers-america"&gt;members began organizing&lt;/a&gt;. Williams took the initiative personally, colleagues said, and believed that a union would make the company less nimble and effective as it worked to become sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m68fVt"&gt;Worse, the data suggested that Medium’s original journalism was not converting free readers to paid subscribers. Surprisingly, what seemed to convert readers most reliably were random stories on the digital content farm that had sprung up around its high-gloss publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoTGgh"&gt;People were largely not finding these stories from journalists or even from Medium’s own recommendation algorithms, which staffers said were ineffective in predictably driving traffic. Instead, like most publications in the platform era, Medium’s traffic successes came from search engines and social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpswXJ"&gt;“Hits would be made either because we managed to get a prime spot on Google or because something made it big on Facebook,” a former employee who worked on the tech platform told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eDtYJG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just do your jobs&lt;/em&gt;, they were told, &lt;em&gt;and everything will be fine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYKUSr"&gt;The original idea behind Medium going all the way back to 2012 was that professionally written stories would create a “halo” around the much larger body of user-generated content, enough to give the entire site a premium feel — and eventually, one that Williams could charge a subscription fee for. But by the end of 2020, the journalism didn’t feel like a halo — it felt like an albatross. And so the journalists were offered buyouts. (And generous ones, by the standards of American journalism: five months of severance pay, and six months of healthcare.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TkZyT"&gt;But to many of the journalists, the news came as a surprise. Employees had gotten mixed messages about which metrics they should use to evaluate their own performance. Traffic? Paid conversions? Something else? Often they were told not to think about any of it. &lt;em&gt;Just do your jobs&lt;/em&gt;, they were told, &lt;em&gt;and everything will be fine&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxq1La"&gt;“They believed if you write it, they will come,” one employee told me. “And it never worked that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0qE0R"&gt;Medium is far from the only company to tell its journalists to ignore the traffic generated by their stories while managers monitor it obsessively in the background. But it created an environment in which reporters were confused about how they, or their publications, would ultimately be judged — leaving them vulnerable to being blindsided when the end finally came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HDD5ZW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AtNEfz"&gt;Ultimately, employees said, responsibility for the events of the past year belonged to Williams, the company’s 48-year-old CEO and one of the few constants at the company since its founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF9vC9"&gt;Few startups have an easy path to success, and media in particular is a notoriously difficult business. Just today, digital culture publication &lt;em&gt;MEL&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dollar-shave-club-seeking-buyer-mel-magazine-2021-3"&gt;laid off its entire staff&lt;/a&gt;. Some staffers told me they appreciated the opportunity Williams had given them during a turbulent time, and said he had granted them impressive creative freedom and significant financial resources with which to do their journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oZe7uh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;what once had been publications are now likely better thought of as topic pages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81o74F"&gt;Staffers who worked on Medium’s core technology platform generally had less positive things to say. Williams was prone to change his mind often, seemingly on a whim, they said, making software development difficult. The product roadmap over the years looks like a series of blind alleys: in 2019, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/blogging-guide/what-is-a-medium-series-f2b382a958b1"&gt;a take on Snapchat stories&lt;/a&gt;; last June, &lt;a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-newsletters-4fe903b5bda7"&gt;a refreshed newsletter platform&lt;/a&gt;; in January, an acquisition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233983/medium-acquires-ebook-company-glose"&gt;an e-book publisher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwuPbw"&gt;In his blog post, Williams said he “can see more focused, high-affinity publications working well as part of the Medium bundle.” But staffers I spoke with at Medium’s existing publications largely do not expect them to survive, at least in their current form. A skeleton crew of editors will likely be kept on to promote user-generated posts to the relevant sites; what once had been publications are now likely better thought of as topic pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykrOyx"&gt;Meanwhile, the company will continue to rely on Google and Facebook traffic to generate hits it can convert into paid subscribers. The acquisition of the e-book publisher, Glose, is intended to create a bigger library of “evergreen” content on Medium that will drive more traffic to the site via search engines. Like Blogger and Twitter before it, Medium will bet on unpaid labor and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pYXI3"&gt;All of which might be fine to the dozens of journalists about to lose their jobs, if Williams would publicly claim some responsibility for his part in the chaos — ”this crazy ride,” as he called it yesterday. Instead, he points to changes in the industry and shrugs. The media business — what can you do?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RB26W5"&gt;But of the employees who remain, few are buying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5nhyc"&gt;“He keeps talking like this company founded in 2012 is a brand new startup finding its way,” one told me. “At a certain point you’re not nimble and iterating. You’re just floundering and failing to follow through and execute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="00sUnc"&gt;
&lt;p id="1dStqQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Panic’s Playdate handheld will be ready for streamers when it launches sometime this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Afi7IPAHqw_gW09Jtdved0uj1uU=/4x0:1614x1073/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021782/Screen_Shot_2021_03_24_at_4.06.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1374843394518786052" target="_blank"&gt;@playdate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iqcMgw"&gt;We’re still waiting on a release date for the Playdate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/22/18628360/playdate-panic-teenage-engineering-qwop-katamari"&gt;a tiny handheld with a crank&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;em&gt;Untitled Goose Game&lt;/em&gt; publisher Panic, but Panic just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1374843394518786052"&gt;showed off a new feature&lt;/a&gt; for the device on the official Playdate Twitter account: you’ll be able to plug the Playdate in to your computer and mirror its screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ5a2J"&gt;As Playdate says in its tweet, there are a lot of potential use-cases for this, including better accessibility and making it easier to stream your Playdate gameplay. And pressing the virtual buttons in the Playdate app will pass them back to your Playdate device, giving you another way to play your games. (It doesn’t look like there’s a virtual crank, but maybe that’s something Panic hasn’t shown off yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLkuMa"&gt;Here’s a short video of the computer connection in action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qfjq1I"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s a fun little new thing we made. Plug in your Playdate, launch this app, and it will mirror your Playdate screen to your PC/Mac/Linux in real-time. Perfect for streamers, YouTubers, and better accessibility. Input from the PC can pass through to the Playdate also! &lt;a href="https://t.co/OE8q1X0txC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OE8q1X0txC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Playdate (@playdate) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1374843394518786052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GTI9PS"&gt;While the Playdate computer app may look a little small in this video, you’ll be able to make it bigger, Panic said in a reply &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1374859534263455746"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. And if you listen closely to the video, you can also hear some extremely charming Playdate menu sound effects, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdate/status/1374851018312183809"&gt;which Panic says are new&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi3HPu"&gt;The Playdate was first revealed in 2019, with games in development from &lt;em&gt;Katamari Damacy&lt;/em&gt; creator Keita Takahashi, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21334116/good-sudoku-iphone-ipad-app-game-zach-gage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;developer&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Zach Gage, and more. At the time, Panic expected to ship the Playdate in early 2020, but said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542841/playdate-games-handheld-panic-delay-2021"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt; that it expects to kick off orders in “early 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jK25wj"&gt;Panic has also set up a Twitter account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playdateAlerts"&gt;@playdateAlerts&lt;/a&gt;, that will only tweet when there is “important” news about the Playdate. If you want to know exactly when you can order the device, @playdateAlerts seems like it a good account to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JrBHYB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Playdate is an adorable handheld with games from the creators of Qwop, Katamari, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/22/18628360/playdate-panic-teenage-engineering-qwop-katamari"},{"title":"Playdate, the tiny handheld with a crank, is delayed to early 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542841/playdate-games-handheld-panic-delay-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Arizona Senate skips vote on controversial bill that would regulate Apple and Google app stores</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12’s OLED screen is excellent." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uaxrmAOr0oIn5bVpoP3Zd_82UVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021754/vpavic_4243_20201018_0141.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Px9JIH"&gt;The Arizona State Senate was scheduled to vote on an unprecedented and controversial bill Wednesday that would have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;imposed far-reaching changes on how Apple and Google operate their respective mobile app stores&lt;/a&gt;, specifically by allowing alternative in-app payment systems. But the vote never happened, having been passed over on the schedule without explanation. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;watched every other bill on the schedule be debated and voted on over the senate’s live stream, but Arizona HB2005, listed first on the agenda, never came up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91sY1K"&gt;One notable Apple critic is now accusing the iPhone maker of stepping in to stop the vote, saying the company hired a former chief of staff to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to broker a deal that prevented the bill from being heard in the Senate and ultimately voted on. This is after the legislation, an &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;amendment to the existing HB2005 law&lt;/a&gt;, passed the Arizona House of Representatives earlier this month in a &lt;a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview?SessionID=123"&gt;landmark 31-29 vote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZo6Kk"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show. The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard,” said Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, a fierce Apple critic who submitted testimony in support of HB2005, on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;Twitter this afternoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqFFBr"&gt;Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kTduxV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzgvhY"&gt;It was well-known prior to today’s scheduled vote that both Apple and Google had hired lobbyists to combat the bill, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;because it directly threatened the companies’ industry standard app store commission of 30 percent. If the Arizona bill passed the senate and was signed into law by Ducey, it would have made the state a haven for app makers looking to sidestep the App Store and the Google Play Store’s payment systems, which are the mechanisms the companies use to take their cuts of all app sales and in-app purchases of digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2x3kDh"&gt;It could have also caused all sorts of additional headaches for both companies by forcing them to either institute a patchwork system of state-specific enforcement, or by potentially forcing them to stop doing business in Arizona altogether while opening the door to lawsuits against the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV9P5i"&gt;In testimony in front of the Arizona House earlier this month, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, argued that the App Store provides enough value to developers to justify the 30 percent cut. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7QnRI"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he added. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="p9yUEK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nV7sfp"&gt;It’s worth noting that the bill also faced considerable opposition in the Arizona House not by big business-loving Republicans, but instead by Democrats. A number of Democrats publicly objected to the bill and voted against it on the grounds it was potentially unconstitutional for interfering with interstate commerce and also that it interjected Arizona into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;California legal fight between game developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Android and iOS platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj59JQ"&gt;The bill, which was primarily sponsored by Rep. Regina Cobb (R-5), is one of many that have popped up in state legislatures around the country challenging Apple’s and Google’s longstanding policies around the mobile app economy. These bills can be traced back to growing antitrust pressure against Big Tech mounting in both Europe and Washington, DC, and they &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201"&gt;represents a new local and state front in the ongoing fight over the tech industry’s outsize power&lt;/a&gt; and whatever methods lawmakers may employ to try and reign it in. Other arenas include California, where Epic launched its own fight, and the European Union. which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;launched antitrust investigations into the App Store and Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; over anticompetitive claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ2Wes"&gt;Both Apple and Google operate the two most dominant app stores in the world, and while the Google Play Store allows alternative app stores and therefore alternative payments systems, Apple does not. That means all digital purchases on iOS are subject to Apple’s mandated 30 percent cut, or in some cases a reduced 15 percent cut, though Apple has been criticized for cutting secret deals, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;those it has made with Amazon&lt;/a&gt; over Prime Video subscriptions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change"&gt;later in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;, to exempt certain types of purchases when it’s strategically convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zivmsg"&gt;Both companies in the last six months &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;announced changes&lt;/a&gt; to the commission structure that allows for smaller developers, which represent the vast majority of app makers on both Android and iOS, to claim a reduced 15 percent cut, though that has done little assuage the app store critics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jZ1f51"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These state app store bills have become lobbying battlegrounds between Big Tech and its fiercest critics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5OCugI"&gt;These antitrust proposals, like HB2005, are largely the work of the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF). The CAF is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453745/spotify-epic-tile-match-coalition-for-app-fairness-apple-app-store-policies-protest"&gt;industry group formed last year&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Epic, Spotify, Tinder parent company Match Group, and dozens of other companies that have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo of the mobile app economy and the app store owners’ ironclad developer agreements. Some of these companies, like Spotify, have for years complained of unfair treatment from Apple and have accused the company of prioritizing its own software over competitors through its use of App Store rules and iOS requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORWNpa"&gt;The CAF began &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;lobbying lawmakers earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, first in North Dakota and now in multiple states including Arizona, to instigate the introduction of bills like HB2005. While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;North Dakota bill failed&lt;/a&gt;, Arizona’s was seen as a more promising alternative because it focused solely on in-app payment systems, while the North Dakota one also mandated that operating system owners allow for alternative app stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOSu9z"&gt;“The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="982M8k"&gt;Now, the bill’s fate is now in question, and it’s not immediately clear what happened. Rep. Cobb, the bill’s sponsor, did not respond to a request for comment. The Arizona governor’s office and the office of the Arizona State Senate Majority Leader Rick Gray (R-21) also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Er7bnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 10:12PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from the Coalition for App Fairness. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ahead of IPO, Coinbase users speak out about locked accounts and lost money  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange Website : Illustration" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zqaL06m_E5L1DXxBMTyqiYF0x10=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69021521/1304243746.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXXvJT"&gt;As it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300835/coinbase-s1-bitcoin-going-public-profit-revenue-invest-crypto"&gt;prepares to go public&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase is still struggling to provide support to customers who have issues &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1220367/coinbases-customer-complaints-more-than-doubled-in-january/"&gt;with funds being available&lt;/a&gt;, or their accounts being hacked or locked, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/coinbase-bitcoin-complaints.html"&gt;a report by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The exchange is often considered to be one of the safer bets for those looking to invest in crypto, but the story shows that users who run into trouble could be left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuvCDA"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of dozens of customers who have had money stolen from their accounts, or who have had their accounts locked (which &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/mc7ewq/reply_case_04932724_disabled_to_deposit_and_buy/"&gt;seems to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/mc6qoj/120000_wire_transfer_sent_and_account_was/"&gt;a frequent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/mcbt9g/i_want_my_money_back/"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt;), and their difficulties getting in touch with a real person at Coinbase. The company’s vice president of customer experience says that it faces “a unique set of customer experience challenges” due to the fact that crypto trading is always active, and has recently seen an increase in demand. But Coinbase’s trust issues go back a long time — back in 2014 we wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/7/5386222/a-string-of-thefts-hit-coinbase-bitcoins-most-reputable-wallet-service"&gt;how some customers lost trust in the company after their accounts were hacked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fky7wy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If customers feel like they can’t trust a platform, they’ll look for alternatives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FyiCmI"&gt;Coinbase also told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that real humans reply to requests for help, and that it had added 2,000 people to its support team in recent months. The company also publicly committed to &lt;a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/committing-to-better-customer-service-during-this-time-of-heightened-interest-in-the-cryptoeconomy-5dc2637c4fa7"&gt;better and faster customer support back in January&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/"&gt;the Coinbase subreddit&lt;/a&gt; is still mostly dedicated to people talking about how the company’s support hasn’t been helping them (though it is worth noting that the sample is somewhat self-selecting, and Reddit posts aren’t verified proof of an issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3r16F"&gt;Coinbase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;may not be alone&lt;/a&gt; in having poor customer support, but having a reputation for not helping its users could be problematic for a company that wants to be publicly traded — if customers feel like they can't trust a platform, they’ll look for alternatives. And, as a a financial crimes expert points out in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, the company will also be subject to greater regulatory oversight and visibility if it’s public.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsDnBA"&gt;A new, detailed shot of a black hole reveals spiraling lines of mysterious magnetic forces that give astronomers an unprecedented look at how these cosmic monsters behave. It’s an intimate portrait of the black hole at the center of the gigantic M87 galaxy, which lies some 55 million light-years away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77roPF"&gt;Black holes are scattered across the universe and exist in almost every galaxy, but their behavior remains one of the most intriguing mysteries in astronomy. The image helps depict how the black hole violently swallows matter and shoots energetic jets back out from its core. Those jets can extend thousands of lightyears into space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU2ljr"&gt;Today’s photo is from the same international team of radio astronomers who shot&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18303661/first-picture-black-hole-sagittarius-event-horizon-telescope"&gt; the first photo&lt;/a&gt; of a black hole, ever, in 2019. In the two years since then, more than 300 scientists have been scrutinizing data from that image as part of a global project called The Event Horizon Telescope. They found that a large portion of the dark-orange light surrounding the black hole’s mouth is filtered through a soup of magnetic energy that can be mapped and measured in unprecedented detail.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0kZPXS"&gt;So, putting on a pair of the radio-astronomy equivalent of polarized sunglasses, astronomers sharpened their focus on the cosmic body to reveal distinct lines of magnetic energy flowing inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU3MsU"&gt;The result is a “major milestone,” says Iván Martí-Vidal, coordinator of the Event Horizon Telescope’s Polarimetry Working Group. The new image helps astronomers better understand the physics behind the first image, he says. Today’s image hints at the role magnetic turbulence plays in a black hole’s ability to gobble up cosmic material and shoot matter out into the universe. Astronomers are still trying to understand what steers this chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
