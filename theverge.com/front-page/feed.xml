    <title>CES had a pretty good year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bJO2NqWdUmUgjGuobP-7_cVb3A=/34x0:4929x3263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358935/37_SW_FinBMW_iX_eInk_Seite_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A BMW concept using e-ink to automatically change the paint color on a car from white to black and back again&lt;/em&gt; | BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q83Crg"&gt;Another year of the Consumer Electronics Show has wrapped up, and it was a strange one: the weeks leading up to it were filled with cancellations due to Omicron, and as a result the show floor was virtually empty. The keynote presentations lacked the usual spectacle; the pomp was overshadowed by the circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O71uDU"&gt;Nevertheless, I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1478409885431730179"&gt;found myself surprised&lt;/a&gt; to realize that CES 2022 was a slightly better than average year for the show. There weren’t any industry-shaking products announced and shipping — but that almost never happens at CES, and the expectation that it should was always misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUZvUh"&gt;Instead, we saw some genuinely good improvements on technology that will actually ship, which isn’t always the case at CES. Here are just a few of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwTGGr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://t.co/wrON4JItQp"&gt;Dell’s XPS 13 Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a bold (maybe too bold) reimagining of a classic laptop design. It’s too bad the company mixed some interesting ideas with one obviously bad one: dropping the headphone jack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wvf4QH"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://t.co/klh9SpUVJ5"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://t.co/OU7KoJTwhC"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; both had chip announcements that should lead to some solid computers (although an M1-level revolution isn’t on the table for PCs yet). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GZRgF8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"&gt;smart home ecosystem is gearing&lt;/a&gt; up for a big year with more ambitious products designed to actually work together with the new Matter standard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lXt85I"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;curved monitor&lt;/a&gt; you can rotate 90 degrees so it swoops over your head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EGlBIJ"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858402/home-robot-labrador-caddie-retriever-smart-self-driving-shelf"&gt;home robot that could actually be useful&lt;/a&gt; because it doesn’t try to do anything too futuristic, just provide the service of helping people with mobility issues carry stuff around. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UnuVa6"&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865220/sony-a95k-qd-oled-qdoled-4k-tv-announced-features-explainer"&gt;Quantum Dot OLED technology&lt;/a&gt; that should allow OLED screens to be much brighter — plus there’s the CES intrigue of Sony announcing a TV with a Samsung-made panel before Samsung itself announced a TV. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q7qdE8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865673/samsung-freestyle-portable-lifestyle-projector-not-olds"&gt;portable projector that manages to solve for the actual hassles&lt;/a&gt; involved with portable projectors. It was almost like the product manager used these types of products and understood their problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OyO1R6"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866703/hp-elite-dragonfly-g3-chromebook-enterprise-laptops"&gt;Chromebook that slots into the high-end spot&lt;/a&gt; that’s been frustratingly empty for about two years now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="fUk2zN"&gt;Then there’s the stuff that will likely never ship but are worth examining as the concepts that they are. Not because they’re inspiring examples of hashtag-innovation, but because they reveal the id of consumer tech: companies that desperately want you to believe they’re innovative, environmentally friendly, and have multi-year roadmaps that are actually realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nb7Va"&gt;I’m talking about electric cars, of course. CES is just as much a car show as it is a gadget show — and the cars are all gadgets now, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9FqIj"&gt;There was one concept car that was just unabashedly fun because it was cool and because nobody pretended that it would turn into a real product. That would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;BMW’s use of E Ink on the body panels of an iX&lt;/a&gt; to give it the ability to change from black to white at the flip of a switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZA56"&gt;But we sit in a strange time where every car manufacturer needs to earnestly project that they’re switching to electric but &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;most of them have yet to ship EVs at meaningful scale&lt;/a&gt;. Which means that CES 2022 was filled with more than its usual share of concept cars and paper-thin promises that in [insert year here], the company will be fully electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tevrRd"&gt;The biggest car news of the show was undoubtedly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;, but it has a target ship date of late 2023, which is plenty of time for plans to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="66TCRJ"&gt;Mercedes-Benz had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22855555/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-range-ces-2022"&gt;DB5-looking concept&lt;/a&gt; whose purpose was to convince us that 600+ mile ranges could be easily achievable in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Itu06e"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868578/cadillac-av-concept-innerspace-ces-2022"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22862387/chrysler-electric-only-2028-airflow-concept-ces-2022"&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; both had concepts that aren’t really going anywhere (literally and figuratively, I suppose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NLQ05S"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866219/bmw-ix-m60-electric-vehicle-range-specs-date"&gt;BMW’s non-E-Ink iX M60 looks like a rad performance crossover&lt;/a&gt; and its summer 2022 release date seems promising. But the electric crossover space is awash in announced-but-barely-shipped EVs and so the burden of proof is on BMW to make this thing at volume. (The same burden lies on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces"&gt;Chevy’s promised $30k Equinox&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0wVFsj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866831/hyundai-robot-mobility-pnd-dnl-autonomous-ces"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867455/gm-sell-autonomous-vehicles-personally-owned-timeline"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22866190/volvo-ride-pilot-level-3-autonomous-subscription-california"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; each made bombastic autonomous driving claims when it would have been better to let the results speak for themselves when (or if) they actually happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="o6Qr0z"&gt;Most egregiously of all to me, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867818/sony-mobility-cars-vision-prototype-ces-2022"&gt;Sony said it’s launching an entirely new company to “explore” getting into the car manufacturing game&lt;/a&gt; alongside revealing another concept vehicle. I would love to be proven wrong, but it read like a blatantly disingenuous grasp at attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zAUT81"&gt;So I am clearly put off by the concept cars this year — but I also have a modicum of sympathy because in this precise moment supply chain issues make ramping up any new thing difficult. CES is the place for tech hype, so it’s no surprise that car companies are participating in that. But when the hyped tech is a category of devices that could be an essential part of eliminating our use of fossil fuels, my sympathy doesn’t go as far as it otherwise would. We &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; EVs to be real and widespread, so looking at concepts that are probably vaporware stings more than if it were a fancy monitor or a weird pretend robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BD24Pa"&gt;But look away from the concept cars (except the E Ink one — that one is still cool). There were plenty of pedestrian laptops, wearables, and various other gadgets that will surely come out this year and definitely seem like improvements on what came before. Nothing worthy of their own keynotes, but all in all a decent enough haul for a weird year at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Fdshx"&gt;Here’s a representative example: one of the staff’s favorite announcements here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s 42-inch OLED TV&lt;/a&gt;. We loved it not because it was a massive, wall-sized TV but because it was small and useful. It fills a hole that needed to be filled — a TV with superb picture quality that works in a smaller room (or, alternately, a potentially cool option for a gaming monitor). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSyryb"&gt;Here’s one more: L’Oreal’s created a hair gadget that combines a dye cartridge with a brush with vibrating bristles. It handles the amount of dye and makes applying it much easier. It’s not Wi-Fi enabled. There is no app. It doesn’t support Bluetooth. It seems great in part because it lacks those things — and the time that would have been wasted building that tech in was instead put into designing it for its actual purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIVyVZ"&gt;That’s what I mean when I say it was a pretty good year for CES. There were more gadgets that seemed more useful this year, making the vaporware easier to ignore. Practicality: what a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Echo Show update adds more live video news providers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pvDM7VaiI_MvN54hQ20hgQyTyrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358744/dseifert_210219_4433_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year’s Echo Show 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qlwu7n"&gt;Amazon has announced a couple of small quality of life improvements for different Alexa devices. Its Echo Show lineup of smart displays are getting more live video news content in the US and an easier way to navigate news channels. Meanwhile, mobile Alexa devices are also gaining the ability to share your ETA while you’re using their navigation features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dW1DGQ"&gt;The new live video content providers for Echo Show owners in the US are from People TV, ET Live, and Bloomberg TV Plus. Amazon says it has more on the way soon. These new channels, as well as the Echo Show’s existing library of live video and on demand audio news channels, can now be accessed via a new provider list that’ll be displayed at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1zVjEm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live content from People TV, ET Live, and Bloomberg TV Plus is now available&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UoUyNC"&gt;As well as offering manual selection, compatible Echo Show devices can also personalize the news they show you by listening to your voice using Voice ID, or your appearance using Visual ID. Visual ID launched alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=23615589011"&gt;also available&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10 (3rd gen)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 8 (2nd gen)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkqaQm"&gt;If you’re the kind of person that uses Alexa for navigation on devices like the Echo Auto, Echo Buds, Echo Frames, or a car with Alexa built-in, then the new ETA sharing feature could be a useful addition. Amazon says asking Alexa to “share my ETA home” will announce your predicted arrival time to your other Alexa-enabled devices like smart speakers. If your mobile Alexa device is paired with an Android smartphone you can also send an ETA via text by saying “Alexa, share my ETA with X,” where “X” is the name of one of your contacts. Alexa’s navigation feature draws from the default navigation app on your paired smartphone, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=help_search_1-4&amp;amp;nodeId=GA2XEQXBHZUAA6HJ&amp;amp;qid=1641559142721&amp;amp;sr=1-4"&gt;Amazon’s support page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord hacking is the newest threat for NFT buyers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TICXBLmVGxyF_XOuxVRXsrpAeA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358664/acastro_210106_4957_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;One compromised admin account led to two projects being scammed in a day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="fWvBB5"&gt;On Tuesday, December 21st, two NFT projects fell victim to the same attack. Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop — essentially a free distribution to early supporters — a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZS5C6"&gt;Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official “announcements” channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance — but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiSUnZ"&gt;In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MonkeyKingdom_/status/1473312369556213769"&gt;from Monkey Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1473328245030277122"&gt;then from Fractal&lt;/a&gt;, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848840/scammers-steal-crypto-nft-project-fractal-discord-hack-solana"&gt;got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hong-kong-nft-project-monkey-kingdom-loses-1-3m-in-phishing-hack-launches-compensation-fund"&gt;reported to be $1.3 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bhku8l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4nfzb"&gt;Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens — specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It’s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers — and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUsofG"&gt;In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be “called” (or, in a closer approximation, “texted”) to connect to an application on the other end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7c06SM"&gt;By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake “announcement” had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags — but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="l5IiLd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TODSKE"&gt;Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks"&gt;official documentation&lt;/a&gt; describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it’s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there’s no way to switch off all of them at once if you’ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren’t paying attention to their integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6tDQW"&gt;A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy &lt;a href="https://discord.com/moderation"&gt;resource center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKP4j2"&gt;“Discord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,” said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. “While there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LuHYgv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WNBHhq"&gt;The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7UPQs"&gt;By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LittlelemonsNFT/status/1477923368053706755"&gt;phishing attack that involves getting the target banned&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND5ctD"&gt;Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. “This is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,” Pappas said. “It’s a very difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZRRCB"&gt;In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym “Monkey King”) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nz8Zj"&gt;NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours — or sometimes minutes — so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E5XCGu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMfTtu"&gt;In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers. &lt;a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/nft-market-report.html"&gt;A Chainalysis examination&lt;/a&gt; of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0CBHH"&gt;There’s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there’ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins — but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="amkDkT"&gt;The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead. Fractal, the game asset marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/30/justin-kans-gaming-nft-platform-goes-live-rebounding-from-150k-discord-exploit/"&gt;went live&lt;/a&gt; on the penultimate day of 2021. And having reimbursed money that was lost by members, Monkey Kingdom is relaunching the NFT line that was interrupted by the hack. The community is loyal, the Monkey King told us, and fans are once again ready to pick up a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>France fines Google and Facebook for pushing tracking cookies on users with dark patterns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5mfthtfGqNbJOU581sdjTzStz_A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358398/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5HD1YN"&gt;If you ever feel like websites have turned the simple business of rejecting tracking cookies into a labyrinthine task that involves close-reading of multiple dialog boxes, then France’s data protection agency has your back. The watchdog (CNIL) has &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance"&gt;fined Google €150 million ($170 million) and Facebook €60 million ($68 million)&lt;/a&gt; for making it too confusing for users to reject cookies. The companies now have three months to change their ways in France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9hHwC"&gt;With Facebook, CNIL &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-facebook-ireland-limited-fined-60-million-euros"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that in order to refuse cookies, French users first have to click on a button labelled “&lt;em&gt;Accept&lt;/em&gt; cookies” (emphasis ours). Such labelling “necessarily generates confusion,” says CNIL, leading users to believe they have no choice in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiWiZx"&gt;With Google, the problem is one of asymmetry rather than mislabeling. CNIL &lt;a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-google-fined-150-million-euros"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s websites (including YouTube) allow users to accept all cookies with a single click. But, to reject them, they have to click through several different menu items. Clearly, users are being steered in a particular direction that just so happens to benefit Google. (I’m well aware that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t offer a single-click “reject all” cookie button either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="njcxPa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google and Facebook are using dark patterns to push cookies on users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QsmBEA"&gt;EU law states that when citizens hand over data online, they must do so freely and with a full understanding of the choice they are making. CNIL’s judgement is that Google and Facebook are essentially tricking their users, deploying what are known as “dark patterns” — a style of subtly coercive user interface design — to wangle consent and so breaking the law. Hence the fines and the demand that the companies change their cookie UI design within three months. Failure to do so risks additional fines of €100,000 per day, says CNIL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lak2rG"&gt;For anyone particularly interested in the details of European internet regulation (you poor fools), the case is also interesting in that CNIL is acting under the authority of a bit of EU legislation known as the ePrivacy Directive, rather than the more recently-introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mbZ5k"&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, Natasha Lomas &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/cnil-facebook-google-cookie-consent-eprivacy-breaches/"&gt;offers a great explanation as to why this is&lt;/a&gt;, which I’ll do my best to condense. The problem is that GDPR enforcement is funneled through the data watchdog of Ireland, where many US tech firms locate their European headquarters. That  particular agency has proved itself to be &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/apple-google-data-watchdog-in-europe-facing-accusations.html"&gt;a little &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in running down such complaints, which — only a cynic might suggest — is part and parcel of the friendly regulatory environment cultivated by the Irish state to attract US tech money in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw1TAl"&gt;So, in order to get some timely enforcement (or any enforcement) France’s data watchdog has turned to the older ePrivacy Directive, which allows national agencies direct oversight in their own territories. It’s an effective workaround, and CNIL has previously used ePrivacy to fine Google and Amazon &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/"&gt;on similar issues&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, as Lomas points out, Google has yet to face a single regulatory sanction from Ireland’s data watchdog under GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CTamU"&gt;What’s the upshot of all this? Well, if you live in France, you may get a slightly easier option to reject cookies from Google and Facebook sometime in the future. Which is nice, sure, but hardly the sort of decisive action that — if you agree with the stated desire of EU’s fractured, multi-headed data regulation — is supposed to redress the imbalance of power between tech firms and average consumers. But that’s just the way the cookies crumble.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Stephen Hawking Doodle includes narration in the physicist’s voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lmC_lqCq0b63Z-E5qy4YhLknLyY=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358338/Stephen_Hawking_s_80th_Birthday.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yX8vfu"&gt;This weekend, Google will release a Doodle celebrating what would have been Stephen Hawking’s 80th birthday. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isim0ysZ6X4"&gt;two and a half minute-long video&lt;/a&gt; will go live in the US at midnight ET tonight (9pm PT) and includes a narration in the physicist’s own computer-generated voice (created and used with permission from his estate) outlining his work and painting a message of hope for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvOiu8"&gt;Hawking’s digital voice was one of the most recognizable characteristics of the late physicist, who used it to speak after losing his voice due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although more advanced artificial voices were developed over the course of his lifetime, the physicist &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/"&gt;continued to use the original voice&lt;/a&gt; with its American accent after having grown attached to it through years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvcgU9W-X16LP5w9EiP78yuaLaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152127/Stephen_Hawking_s_80th_Birthday.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Doodle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nUXg3U"&gt;The scientist’s children welcomed Google’s Doodle. “He would have found it important to show that he never allowed the challenges of his physical condition to limit his power of expression nor his determination to make an impact on the world in which he lived,” Hawking’s children Lucy, Robert, and Tim Hawking said in a statement. “We hope that his example offers inspiration and hope globally to all who face great challenges at this difficult time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xeo515"&gt;Stephen Hawking passed away in 2018, at the age of 76, after living with ALS for over half a century. The Doodle was illustrated by Google art director Matthew Cruickshank.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft PowerToys gets a new Always On Top feature and launcher web search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUpvq9VCRJE0oy5-K-TYjOEMSl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358322/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7tj0D"&gt;Microsoft is updating PowerToys this week to include a new Always On Top feature and web search functionality in its Spotlight-like launcher. Version 0.53.1 includes the two highly-requested features, alongside a long list of bug fixes and improvements to Microsoft’s 12 PowerToys tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TnPw7"&gt;Always On Top, as the name implies, allows any app to always be in front of others, even if you switch focus to another window. While many apps already support this, PowerToys now ensures anything can be pinned, which is particularly useful for older apps that you might want to keep on top of others across multiple monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_YF0yD2euC238pUQ8Msx_gZ60Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152123/8Q8xsxu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Always On Top PowerToy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nzTl3j"&gt;As games typically run fullscreen and on top of other windows, the Always On Top PowerToy even includes a Game Mode toggle, to allow games to run fullscreen above pinned apps. Other settings include the ability to show a colored border around a pinned app, and even play a sound when an app is pinned. You can also exclude apps from being pinned, and activate Always On Top using the Windows key + Ctrl + T combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It4DD5"&gt;The second useful addition to PowerToys is web search in the Run launcher. Microsoft first debuted its Spotlight-like launcher &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build"&gt;nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Windows users to quickly search for apps and files across the OS. It finally has web search now, allowing you to quickly search the web using your default browser and default search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mi86D1t_BJLXh5XyHaVBStv61TY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23152124/7gTGBhV.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PowerToys Run now has web search.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="szoaRJ"&gt;The default activation command for web results is “??,” or you’ll be offered search results if Run can’t find a relevant file or app. Alongside these two additions, Microsoft and its open source community of developers has also added in support for G-code thumbnails in File Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAMyRy"&gt;PowerToys version 0.53.1 is available now from Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.53.1"&gt;PowerToys GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;, or through the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/getPowertoys"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop reportedly has a whole unit working on NFTs and cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBM9Nkm20r85UJt2Oy3ZhWux2PU=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70358280/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o6VoxK"&gt;Video game retailer and memestock darling GameStop is making a big bet on NFTs and cryptocurrency technology. According to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-entering-nft-and-cryptocurrency-markets-as-part-of-turnaround-plan-11641504417?page=1"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has built up an over 20-person strong team working on an online marketplace for the virtual items, which could include cosmetic skins and in-game items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vatmPR"&gt;The company is said to be courting game developers and publishers to list NFTs on its marketplace, and hopes to ink deals with crypto companies to develop the underlying technology and help invest in games featuring NFT and blockchain tech. In total, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports that GameStop’s investments in crypto could stretch into the tens of millions, and involve agreements made with over a dozen other companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgNFFm"&gt;A spokesperson for GameStop did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zXvbz6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFT job listings at GameStop were spotted last October&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dIUN0e"&gt;The plans are thought to be part of GameStop’s attempt to turnaround its business, which has been rocked in recent years as consumers turn away from physical releases in favor of buying games digitally online. In December the company’s chief executive Matt Furlong (who joined the company from Amazon last year) said the company was exploring the emerging technologies, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747748/gamestop-web3-gaming-nft-job-listing-nfts-ethereum"&gt;job listings relating to Web3 and NFTs&lt;/a&gt; previously emerged in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQdEnr"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes that gamers are seen as potential early adopters for NFTs in particular, because they’re already comfortable with spending money on virtual goods like cosmetic outfits and weapon skins. &lt;a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html"&gt;Square Enix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ea-calls-nft-and-blockchain-games-the-future-of-our-industry/"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt; have publicly expressed interest in exploring the technology, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;Ubisoft launched an NFT platform&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3zmNA"&gt;But so far much of the response from gamers to in-game NFTs has been downright hostile, with many seeing them as being of little value to the overall gameplay experience, and representing a marketing exercise by companies that have for years been happy to sell virtual items without the need for blockchain technology. S&lt;em&gt;.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;developer GSC Game World &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;quickly walked back its NFT plans&lt;/a&gt; after they were widely criticised, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"&gt;Valve has said it won’t allow games using the technology&lt;/a&gt; on its game store Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5MXr3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report comes roughly a year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop found itself at the center of a trading frenzy&lt;/a&gt;, as some day traders attempted to boost its share price and punish short sellers. But despite the investment and attempts at a turnaround, the company continues to be in poor financial shape. Last month it reported that its &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-earnings-report-loss-widened-last-quarter-11638998848?mod=article_inline"&gt;losses were widening&lt;/a&gt;, despite some revenue growth. The company’s share price has been falling throughout the past month and a half, although &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/gamestop-shares-surge-on-report-it-will-create-nft-marketplace-.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that its share price rose by over 22 percent following the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report on its NFT plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Fallout TV series goes into production this year</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PqF6OZ"&gt;Amazon’s TV series based on the &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; video games is moving into production this year. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/01/fallout-series-games-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-geneva-robertson-dworet-graham-wagner-kilter-1234905676/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/fallout-series-amazon-showrunners-jonathan-nolan-1235148546/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that Geneva Robertson-Dworet (&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;) and Graham Wagner (&lt;em&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/em&gt;) will be showrunners on the project; the official &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account retweeted &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;’s story by way of confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NU4n5x"&gt;The Prime Video show will be executive-produced by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, creators of &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;. Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard and Bethesda Softworks’ James Altman are also on board as executive producers. Nolan will direct the first episode, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4KJ1Md"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fallout 76 journal: an ongoing exploration of post-apocalyptic West Virginia","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104858/fallout-76-bethesda-ps4-xbox-pc-online-multiplayer-journal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5N7ojm"&gt;The show was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21311513/amazon-fallout-tv-show-prime-video-westworld-creators-bethesda"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July. “&lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; is one of the greatest game series of all time,” Joy and Nolan said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; back then. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tQyLp"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; video games are post-apocalyptic RPGs set in a alternate future inspired by ‘50s-era US post-war imagery. Bethesda acquired the rights to the series in 2004 and released &lt;em&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2008. The most recent mainline game, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/em&gt;, came out in 2015, while multiplayer spinoff &lt;em&gt;Fallout 76&lt;/em&gt; was released in 2018. No upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fallout&lt;/em&gt; titles have been announced, but future games in the series will likely be exclusive to Xbox and PC platforms due to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325757/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-acquisition-game-pass-exclusive-games-phil-spencer-comment"&gt;acquisition of Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sraOKr"&gt;OnePlus is sharing a few more details about the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22849868/oneplus-pro-china-launch-january-11th-design"&gt;OnePlus 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a focus on camera specifications. If you were hoping for lots of hardware upgrades from this second-gen partnership with Hasselblad, it looks like you’ll have to keep waiting — with the exception of a new ultrawide, these updates are primarily software-based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKzEpi"&gt;To recap some basic camera specs that we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;learned earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus 10 will offer a triple rear camera — likely the same 48-megapixel main, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 8-megapixel telephoto configuration as last year. There’s a 32-megapixel front-facing camera, which is a significant resolution bump from the 9 and 9 Pro’s 16-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzC3Sw"&gt;A notable update is the addition of a shooting mode called RAW Plus which, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174433/apple-ios-14-3-pro-raw-iphone-12-pro-max-update-features"&gt;Apple’s ProRAW format&lt;/a&gt;, combines the benefits of computational photography and RAW image capture. The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro offered a traditional RAW mode, so this is a nice improvement for those who want to tinker with data-rich RAW files while retaining the advanced image processing that smartphone cameras are so good at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UNir2z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vlrPdg"&gt;All three rear cameras can be used in the updated Hasselblad Pro Mode to control exposure settings and shoot 12-bit RAW files. We really liked the intuitive Pro Mode on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, so we’re eager to check out the latest version. There’s a new manual video recording mode, too, called Movie Mode. It offers control over ISO and shutter speed as well as access to a LOG shooting format that better lends itself to post-capture color grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1EJNZ"&gt;The 9 and 9 Pro cameras featured color tuning by Hasselblad, and OnePlus continues to lean into that aspect of the partnership. In this iteration, it combines its own (also Oppo’s own) “Billion Color Solution” and Hasselblad’s color science to bring 10-bit color to each of the phone’s three rear cameras. That should make for smoother color gradations in images — provided that you’re looking at them on a screen capable of displaying all of those colors. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view from OnePlus’ new ultrawide lens is very wide indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ek8K6j"&gt;On the hardware side, there’s a new ultrawide camera sensor with an extreme 150-degree field of view — somewhere in the ballpark of 5mm in 35mm terms. If you want to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; go for a dramatic shot, this lens can be used in combination with a new fisheye mode. For a slightly narrower view, the ultrawide offers a 110-degree mode, which is closer to the 14mm equivalent offered by the 9 and 9 Pro, and uses AI distortion correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCzpZB"&gt;There’s one more hardware change to note: it looks like OnePlus dropped the monochrome camera. This was a low-resolution chip that was included in previous models to assist when shooting black-and-white images. That was the claim, anyway. We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;struggled to find it making any difference&lt;/a&gt; in monochrome images and my colleague Jon Porter has bemoaned its existence for years, describing it at turns as “baffling” and “pointless.” The renders of the 10 Pro that we’ve seen thus far show three useful-looking cameras along with a flash and nothing that looks like a little monochrome sensor in sight. If that’s the case: farewell, monochrome camera, we hardly knew what ye did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XaGyd"&gt;Outside of camera updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs"&gt;what we’ve learned about the OnePlus 10 Pro so far&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising at all. It will come with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, a 120Hz screen, and 50W wireless charging — in line with previous OnePlus flagships and checking all the “2022 Android flagship” boxes. It’s due to launch on January 11th in China with availability in other regions later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Google home speakers are about to get slightly worse because Sonos sued and won</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ce3IEzMFHufCtASw38wt26LyzM8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70357551/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-8.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bIGmIz"&gt;If you have multiple Google smart speakers in your house, you might want to be aware of a certain legal ruling — because it’s going to affect how your speaker groups work. After the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"&gt;ruled that it was infringing on Sonos’ patents&lt;/a&gt;, Google has &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811"&gt;already announced software workarounds&lt;/a&gt; including the “need to adjust each speaker individually instead of using the group volume controller,” and that users will no longer be able to adjust a speaker group’s volume with their phone’s volume rocker. It blames this change on “a recent legal ruling,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"&gt;one which you can read all about right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0VBsq"&gt;When news of the patent decision broke, Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it had gotten non-infringing designs approved by the ITC. Sonos warned, however, that Google might have to “degrade or eliminate product features” to be compliant, and that certainly seems to be what’s happening. We just didn’t necessarily expect it to play out this soon, given that Google has 60 days to get its devices into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0N14DB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google copied Sonos’ multi-zone speaker technology, US import regulator rules","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ju2UU7"&gt;The changes seem like pretty big downgrade to Google’s multi-room audio feature that lets &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7174267?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid#zippy=%2Ccreate-an-audio-group%2Cusing-your-voice"&gt;you synchronize speakers together and have them play all at once&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, instead of being able to say “hey Google, set volume to 40 percent on Living Room speakers,” you’ll have to change the volume for each one, using either the assistant, Google Home app, or a Nest Hub display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlEVrc"&gt;Google also says that “a small set of users” will need to use a specific app to set up their smart devices and update them, and Google is warning users that if their speaker group contains products from other manufacturers, they may need to be updated to the latest firmware to continue functioning as part of that speaker group. Google ends its blog post by saying it will “work to minimize any additional changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
