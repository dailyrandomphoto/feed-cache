    <title>Rudy Giuliani just lost his YouTube privileges for two weeks</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wikrPL"&gt;YouTube has suspended Rudy Giuliani’s YouTube channel for the second time this year for making false claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election and has issued a strike against his channel. It’s Giulani’s second strike within 90 days, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/youtube-suspends-rudy-giuliani-again-for-election-fraud-claims"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;meaning that Giuliani cannot upload videos for two weeks. In a statement, YouTube also cited Giulani’s promotion of nicotine, which is against the company’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvUyKd"&gt;“We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We removed content from the Rudy W. Giuliani channel for violating our sale of regulated goods policy, which prohibits content facilitating the use of nicotine, and our presidential election integrity policy. Additionally, in accordance with our long standing strikes system, we issued a strike against the Rudy W. Giuliani channel, which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KHFBo"&gt;In January, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/youtube-temporarily-suspends-rudy-giuliani-from-partner-program?utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;suspended Giuliani for a week&lt;/a&gt; for sharing 2020 election misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; him from YouTube’s partner program, meaning he couldn’t earn ad revenue on his videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7AT5Y"&gt;If Giuliani gets a third strike in the same 90-day period following the first, his channel will be permanently removed from YouTube, according to the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;company’s strikes policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s advertising ambitions just got even bigger with new Nielsen deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_xl6o-P1xgohBd4v5owUnDePvk=/0x47:1200x847/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894583/roku_verge.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zaL2fS"&gt;Roku, one of the most popular streaming platforms in US homes, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/03/roku-and-nielsen-announce-strategic-alliance-/b-twyx4b-1614633923"&gt;is acquiring Nielsen’s video advertisement business&lt;/a&gt; as it tries to become a central hub for TV advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYhHSN"&gt;Specifically, Roku is acquiring Nielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising unit. The acquisition means that Roku will also acquire Nielsen’s automatic content recognition (ACR) and dynamic ad insertion (DAI) technology. DAI technology simply means that advertisers will be able to receive “better targeting and measurement” capabilities so they can hyper-target a specific audience instead of more broad demographics like age and gender. Think of ads for products people might actually want playing before a YouTube video compared to seemingly random ads playing on CNN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vTL8e"&gt;It’s often referred to as addressable TV advertising because of how advanced the targeting is compared to previous ad tech. For networks, this allows them to maximize their ad inventory value, while advertisers can better track return on investment for ads on a specific show or network. Effectively, the acquisition is going to allow Roku to work with different linear TV programmers to turn traditional TV ads into digital ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Upbs3e"&gt;So, why does this matter for Roku? Think of the power dynamics at hand. There are more than 51.2 million Roku accounts using the platform to stream everything from live, linear television to streaming services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;Netflix and Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;. With Roku controlling Nielsen’s advanced advertising technologies, it puts Roku in a good spot when it comes to negotiating with advertisers who are looking for the best way to target viewers consuming television in a litany of ways. Roku will be able to use its tech platform, and the new advertising tools, to provide the best, focused advertising for firms across both linear TV and streaming video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6iy6sU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think of ads for products people might actually want playing before a YouTube video compared to seemingly random ads playing on CNN&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4576su"&gt;Prior to the announcement, Nielsen’s advanced advertisement group “struck deals with Disney, CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia, A+E Networks and AMC Networks,” &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/roku-acquires-nielsen-advanced-video-advertising-1234918532/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Those companies are expected to have “renewed conversations” with Roku, &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;adds, specifically about “working with Roku to enable addressable ads.” Nothing in life is free, and it seems possible that Roku’s new deal means it’ll be able to take a cut of the ad inventory that would come with new deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWhxSU"&gt;When NBCUniversal executives were trying to negotiate with Roku over bringing their new streaming service, Peacock, to Roku devices, a large part of the delay came from disagreements over advertising inventory. NBCUniversal executives didn’t want to give up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445118/roku-nbc-tv-everywhere-channels-peacock-streaming-distribution-comcast"&gt;significant portion of their advertising revenue&lt;/a&gt; (Roku typically takes 30 percent of ad inventory, but works out specific deals with each partner depending on the offering). Peacock is also ad-supported, and NBCUniversal developed its own targeted digital advertising technology to try and persuade advertisers to place commercials on the platform. Giving up a percentage of that advertising revenue is a tough pill to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjgzxD"&gt;Roku’s biggest advantage — and what seemingly tipped the negotiations — is its scale. The company grew its user base by roughly 40 percent between 2019 and 2020, according to fourth quarter earnings. Even more impressive is its ad-supported Roku Channel, which doubled its audience and reached approximately 61.8 million people in the US in the fourth quarter. Roku’s tech platform and scale is exactly what Nielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising unit needed. So many people in the United States have Roku devices, that not having a channel or streaming service on it is detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMSibf"&gt;While executives feel strongly that addressable TV advertising is the future, it still only makes up about 10 percent of the overall US linear ad business, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/roku-to-acquire-nielsens-advanced-tv-advertising-division-a316980f-a63c-4305-b816-8208bf33f951.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the unit will work off more than 100 million connected devices instead of 55 million, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;adds, giving Nielsen even more insight into the potential of digital ads on linear networks. Spending on addressable TV advertising in the United States is expected to hit “$3.6 billion by 2022, up 75% from August 2020, according to recent estimates by research firm eMarketer,” &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbgqJG"&gt;If the industry eventually shifts into more being spent on addressable TV advertising, Roku will hold the key position. This also helps explain why Roku spent $150 million in late 2019 to purchase Dataxu, an ad tech company, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/roku-nielsen-acr-acquisition"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Roku’s business is increasingly more reliant on its digital platform, which is powered by advertising. Making it so everyone else may have to pay a fee to reap the benefits of being on the platform seems like a smart business move for Roku. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grimes sold $6 million worth of digital art as NFTs</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JzkT16"&gt;Grimes is the latest artist to get in on the NFT gold rush, selling around $6 million worth of digital artworks after putting them up for auction yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKdrsb"&gt;A series of 10 pieces — some one of a kind, others with thousands of copies — went up for sale on &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/grimes"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; on February 28th. The highest-selling piece was a one-of-a-kind video called “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;Death of the Old&lt;/a&gt;” that involves flying cherubs, a cross, a sword, and glowing light that’s set to an original song by Grimes. The winning bidder took it for nearly $389,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfZMIe"&gt;The bulk of the sales came from two pieces with thousands of copies available that sold for $7,500 each. The works, titled “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xe04cc101c671516ac790a6a6dc58f332b86978bb/1"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xe04cc101c671516ac790a6a6dc58f332b86978bb/2"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;,” are both short videos featuring their titular planet with a giant cherub over it holding a weapon, also set to original music. Nearly 700 copies were sold for a total of $5.18 million before sales closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0lEKV"&gt;If you’re totally perplexed as to what’s happening here, welcome to the party. After slowly growing in popularity over the past several months, NFTs exploded over the past week or so as the hot new tech thing. The tech — which stands for “non-fungible token” — allows buyers to purchase ownership of a digital good, usually an image, animation, or video, in the form of a unique digital token living on a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZLj6y"&gt;NFTs allow buyers to support artists, but it also gives buyers a couple things in return. Buyers may not get to hang these digital pieces on their wall, but they might get bragging rights for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;purchasing a famous work like Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt; or something from a popular artist like Grimes. NFTs are also a speculative asset, and many marketplaces have popped up that offer the ability to resell them — theoretically for a lot more, so long as the hype around NFTs continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsejjH"&gt;Grimes isn’t the only artist to have made out big on NFTs already. The digital artist Beeple sold $3.5 million worth of art through Nifty Gateway last year. The artist behind Nyan Cat made around $600,000. And the electronic musician 3LAU &lt;a href="https://edm.com/gear-tech/3lau-record-breaking-nft-sale"&gt;reportedly made more than $11 million&lt;/a&gt; from album sales and digital goods just this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QM57Ob"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; ️The "War Nymph" collection is dropping tomorrow, February 28 @ 2pm EST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you ready for this collaboration between &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Grimezsz&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacBoucher1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MacBoucher1&lt;/a&gt;? Who is excited for this drop?    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't forget a % of the proceeds from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFT&lt;/a&gt; sales will be donated to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carbon_180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@carbon_180&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z07WTvrM6g"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z07WTvrM6g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nifty Gateway (@niftygateway) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niftygateway/status/1365806419828596738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hWtwR"&gt;Nifty Gateway said that an undisclosed percentage of Grimes’ sales would go to Carbon180, a nonprofit focused on removing carbon from the atmosphere. The donations may be meant to address one of the major problems that NFTs share with other blockchain technologies — they’re hugely inefficient in their electricity use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAMbd3"&gt;Each of the works is part of Grimes’ “WarNymph” collection, made in collaboration with her brother Mac Boucher. Grimes debuted War Nymph in 2019 and initially used &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/grimes-miss-anthropocene-interview/"&gt;the “digital persona” slash “alternative psyche”&lt;/a&gt; to promote her album &lt;em&gt;Miss Anthropocene&lt;/em&gt;. War Nymph’s appearance has changed over time, morphing into the vaguely demonic winged baby seen in these NFTs last January, shortly before she confirmed her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Fka88"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 1st, 11:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yesterday was February 28th, not November 28th, as this article very clearly misstated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clue gets FDA clearance for digital birth control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BioWink GmbH Secures $7million In Funding From Investors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHMI6q2gn5wvfYGww_wrvnd_Ie0=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894296/491970246.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SI53NX"&gt;Clue, best known for its period tracking app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K193330"&gt;received clearance&lt;/a&gt; from the Food and Drug Administration for a digital birth control function, which it says can help users prevent pregnancy based only on the start date of a user’s period. It calculates the window where someone could get pregnant based on statistical modeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBASYu"&gt;“It personalizes over time. So as the individual puts in their cycle day one then we’re able to personalize the window of their high risk days vs their low risk days,” Clue’s chief medical officer Lynae Brayboy &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdDV2"&gt;The company plans to launch its digital birth control some time this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y9eyG"&gt;Clue says that its digital birth control is 92 percent effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy when it’s used the way most people do (accounting for some errors) and 97 percent effective under perfect use. The statistical method it uses was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/18/fertility-app-dot-bills-itself-as-contraception/"&gt;originally developed&lt;/a&gt; and tested by researchers at the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University and a company called Cycle Technologies, and acquired by Clue in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V0PQ6F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second form of digital birth control to get clearance from the FDA &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="od10zS"&gt;This is the second form of digital birth control to get clearance from the FDA to market itself as birth control. The first, Natural Cycles, requires users to take their body temperature each morning. Its 2018 clearance was controversial — it came just after the app was blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16895978/natural-cycles-contraceptive-app-unwanted-pregnancies-complaint"&gt;unwanted pregnancies in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ETFsE"&gt;Clue’s digital birth control was cleared by the FDA under its “substantially equivalent” designation, meaning that the agency determined that it was safe and effective because it’s similar to a product already on the market. In this case, Clue’s product was considered similar enough to Natural Cycles. Elina Berglund, the CEO of Natural Cycles, said in a statement that the company will be doing its own analysis of Clue. “Our initial findings based on the FDA filing indicate a significant difference between Natural Cycles and this other product — including that this product is solely based on menstrual data and no other biomarker such as temperature,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGgDdz"&gt;The idea behind digital birth control is related to fertility awareness methods of birth control, where people track metrics like the dates of their periods, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/basal-body-temperature/about/pac-20393026#:~:text=Your%20basal%20body%20temperature%20is,predict%20when%20you'll%20ovulate."&gt;their temperature&lt;/a&gt;, and changes to their cervical mucus to predict when they’re ovulating and could become pregnant. These methods &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/fertility-apps-birth-control-evidence.html"&gt;can be highly effective&lt;/a&gt; when used correctly, but they typically take rigorous, hands-on tracking. They can be good options for people who can’t or don’t want to use hormonal birth control or other methods, but some experts &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/fertility-apps-birth-control-evidence.html"&gt;worry that the principles&lt;/a&gt; can’t translate into apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fdlxH6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If someone is ineligible or their cycle becomes too irregular, the app will lock them out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GwAXBL"&gt;Only people who are between 18 and 45 years old and who have regular periods should use Clue’s birth control, the company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is ineligible or their cycle becomes too irregular, the app will lock them out, said CEO Audrey Tsang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrX4kq"&gt;Clue’s period tracker previously had a feature that predicted if users were in a fertile window — the day of and days leading up to ovulation. The app said that the fertile window feature &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/clue-is-not-a-contraceptive-for-now"&gt;should not be used as birth control&lt;/a&gt; but could help users who are &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/how-to-use-the-clue-app-to-help-you-become-pregnant"&gt;trying to become pregnant&lt;/a&gt;. The company removed that feature &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/how-to-use-the-clue-app-to-help-you-become-pregnant"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it could be inaccurate. “We determined that it could be misleading to those who wish to use the fertile window to avoid pregnancy,” it said in a &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/how-to-use-clue/why-we-are-removing-the-fertile-window"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We hope to offer a solution to this problem in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio files to go public, has sold over 80 million TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2yr4TWLPkYM6tLwhzrL4iyJxF8=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894280/vizio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ecdmyw"&gt;Vizio today &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835591/000119312521062802/d87723ds1.htm"&gt;filed its S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; as the TV and soundbar maker heads toward an initial public offering. “We envision the Vizio smart TV as the center of the connected home — where families play games together, where friends watch movies together, where work and learning happen, and where all things in between take place,” Vizio founder, chairman, and CEO William Wang wrote in a letter that opens the S-1. “Going public is an important milestone for us as we continue to grow and execute our goals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrlcoi"&gt;The filing reveals that Vizio has sold over 80 million TVs and 11 million soundbars since the company’s founding. It sold 7.1 million TVs in 2020. Vizio’s TVs have long delivered performance and picture quality far above their price, though in recent years competitors like TCL have tried to outdo the company in this regard. “We will continue our successful hardware business, iterating on models as we’ve done before, and at the same time build our name in smart TV software,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3WxMV"&gt;The S-1 begins with Wang recounting his surviving a plane crash. “I ran to the front of the plane, forced open the emergency door and jumped out,” he said. “I’ll save you the messy details, but let’s just say that I am beyond thankful to be here today, writing you this letter.” According to Wang, his renewed appreciation of being home — and a desire to make it “everyone’s favorite place” — led to Vizio’s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6meYb7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio conquered the smart TV; now it wants to put Atmos in your living room","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21233344/vizio-elevate-interview-william-wang-ceo-soundbar-audio"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1Hvdz8"&gt;But the future is more so about software and platforms than it is about selling TVs, where the profit margins are often scant. Later in the filing, Vizio says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="s3ffsB"&gt;While we generate the significant majority of our total net revenue from sales of our Smart TVs and sound bars, our Platform+ net revenue has grown 304.4 percent from $36.4 million in 2018 to $147.2 million in 2020. We believe that Platform+ will be the key driver of our future margin growth and financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="L8PGCZ"&gt;“Platform+” refers to a combination of SmartCast (the software that runs on Vizio’s TVs) and Inscape, which is Vizio’s data, analytics, and content recognition subsidiary. The S-1 points out that the company continues to see huge advertising potential from its ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) services like WatchFree and Vizio Free Channel. It also sells ad space on the SmartCast home screen and gets a percentage of subscriptions and purchases made in third-party apps on its platform. Plus, Vizio charges streaming partners to put their logo on TV boxes or branded remote buttons. The company says there are currently over 12 million active SmartCast accounts. (Interestingly, Vizio also reveals there are 5.3 million internet-connected TVs still running its legacy software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syhuKQ"&gt;(Important background on Vizio’s data practices: the company agreed in 2017 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/6/14522582/vizio-ftc-lawsuit-tv-viewing-habits-tracking-privacy"&gt;pay the FTC $2.2 million&lt;/a&gt; over charges that the company was tracking customer viewing habits without obtaining sufficient consent. Those same concerns also led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/4/17937052/vizio-17-million-settlement-tv-data-tracking-lawsuit"&gt;$17 million class action settlement&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vizio tried to reinvent the TV experience in 2016 but has pulled back on some of those experiments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VNnaHR"&gt;Vizio tried to completely reinvent the TV experience in 2016 by removing all built-in apps from its first SmartCast TVs. Instead, the TVs relied on “casting” content from entertainment apps on mobile devices. The company also briefly ditched the traditional TV remote control and packaged an Android tablet with those TVs. Both of these grand experiments were reined in a few years later, with Vizio again bundling popular apps on its TV platform (while retaining the same casting features as before) and switching back to a normal remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJFg0V"&gt;Risk factors in the S-1 are all pretty standard, though Vizio does acknowledge the sometimes fractious relationship between streaming app companies and platforms. “If we are unable to provide a competitive entertainment offering through SmartCast, our ability to attract and retain consumers would be harmed,” the document says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxiGlN"&gt;Vizio says it envisions the future of SmartCast expanding beyond pure entertainment to include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wwnTr9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication: &lt;/em&gt;Engaging with social networks, using messaging services and accessing telecommuting features such as video conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7snmWX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitness and wellness: &lt;/em&gt;Connecting to interactive fitness and wellness services, such as personal training sessions and exercise tracking, from the comfort of their own living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXImJO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commerce:&lt;/em&gt; Browsing online shopping services, purchasing products featured on TV as part of dynamic ads and placing food orders on delivery services through voice control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox5bO2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Community:&lt;/em&gt; Hosting virtual, integrated watch parties for the latest movie or the big game; watching live sports on TV will become an interactive experience through play-along gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjuiOb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamic entertainment experiences: &lt;/em&gt;Attending virtual concerts or sporting events offering viewer-controlled, multi-cam experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6hQ2er"&gt;Vizio has applied to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VZIO.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo’s first EV is stuck at cargo ports waiting for a software update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4pK1u1AWGpYRsD_Hmqt7prMwZU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894077/ahawkins_201221_4352_6454.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7qdKwr"&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge electric SUVs are currently being held at US ports because the company is waiting to ship a crucial software update before releasing them to customers and dealers, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucX6rR"&gt;The problem appears to be that these XC40 Recharge SUVs — which is Volvo’s first all-electric vehicle — left the company’s factory without the Volvo On Call software activated. Volvo On Call is a subscription service that connects Volvo cars to an owner’s smartphone, allowing them to remotely turn the vehicle on and off, lock or unlock the doors, and access diagnostic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgOSv"&gt;One customer, who was supposed to take delivery of his XC40 Recharge at the end of February, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; his dealer’s best guess is that his SUV may not make it out of the port in Newark, New Jersey until mid-April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBIUWB"&gt;“[Y]our Recharge has arrived at Port Newark. However, at this time delivery of your XC40 Recharge will be delayed due to the Volvo On Call system not yet being functional due to a software issue,” reads one email from Volvo’s corporate customer service sent in mid-February and viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are awaiting word from Volvo Sweden on final updates for the cars in the ports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1wB1ke"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A crucial piece of Volvo’s software still needs to be activated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="draPAl"&gt;It’s unclear how many XC40 Recharge SUVs are currently stuck waiting for the software fix. But customers on Volvo forums &lt;a href="https://www.xc40forum.com/threads/xc40-recharge.1670/page-9#post-12963"&gt;have shared similar messages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.xc40forum.com/threads/xc40-p8-deliveries-delayed.2594/"&gt;reported cars stuck at ports&lt;/a&gt; in New York, Maryland, and California. Some buyers, especially in Europe, have reported taking delivery of the vehicle, which started rolling off Volvo’s production line late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esFVta"&gt;Russell Datz, Volvo’s national media relations manager for the US market, did not respond to specific questions about the apparent delay and software issue. “The timing of U.S. customer deliveries of XC40 Recharge has not changed from the original schedule of Q1 2021,” he wrote in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jGO8ie"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Driving the XC40 Recharge, Volvo’s first electric crossover with native Android Auto","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EWzmVd"&gt;Just last week, Volvo issued the &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/277395/volvo-cars-initiates-first-ever-over-the-air-software-update-on-xc40-recharge"&gt;first over-the-air software update&lt;/a&gt; for existing XC40 customers that included a “new base software for the car’s main electronics systems, an increase in charging speed, and an improved driving range,” as well as an unspecified “important safety-related propulsion bug fix.” Datz declined to say whether this is related to Volvo On Call not working on the XC40 SUVs currently stuck in ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uyGVf"&gt;“[A] new Volvo is no longer at its finest when it leaves the factory, but keeps improving over time as additional OTA updates are launched,” the company wrote in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SrQSmE"&gt;Volvo’s far from the first automaker to run into issues with its first mass-market electric vehicle, let alone problems with software. Volkswagen’s first mass-production EV, the ID 3, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess"&gt;delayed in 2020 and then eventually released with incomplete software&lt;/a&gt;. Other automakers have run into far more serious problems, like General Motors and Hyundai, which have recently been reckoning with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;reports of fires in the battery packs of their EVs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will label COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and enforce a strike system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wThdWc5ICq5o30zG0wPAWGsFyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894023/acastro_201106_1777_vote_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="miqZ2y"&gt;Twitter announced Monday that it will &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/updates-to-our-work-on-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation.html"&gt;start labeling tweets&lt;/a&gt; that share misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines. The labels will include links to relevant information from official bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Twitter plans to enforce a five-strike system for repeat offenders that can lead to locked accounts and permanent suspension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUH3q2"&gt;The new labels are similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;Facebook’s anti-misinformation banners&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254733/twitter-covid-19-misleading-information-label-warnings-misinformation"&gt;the labels Twitter began deploying&lt;/a&gt; early in the pandemic. They appear as text underneath misleading tweets, with links to information from official sources or Twitter’s rules. Twitter says it applies these labels through a combination of human and automated review systems and is starting its rollout with English-language content first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iM6Rrx6W9jt5mrMJl7xkZVfv8cY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337625/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_12.44.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a labeled tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rFBsOk"&gt;Twitter has specific criteria for labeling in its &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy"&gt;COVID-19 misleading information policy&lt;/a&gt;, but generally, the company targets five categories of false or misleading information: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VJ2AYF"&gt;Misinformation about the nature of the virus &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Snq6Tv"&gt;Misinformation about the efficacy of treatments and preventive measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OR9wmE"&gt;Misinformation about regulations, restrictions, and exemptions in association with health advisories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PpuYZ4"&gt;Misinformation about the prevalence of the virus and the risk of infection or death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jQsynJ"&gt;Misleading affiliations (for example, claiming to be a doctor or public health official)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zFbSxM"&gt;Labels also feed into the new strike system for COVID-19 misinformation. A harmful, labeled tweet counts as one strike. If Twitter determines the misinformation is particularly dangerous in its questioning of COVID-19 treatments and invokes a larger conspiracy connected to the virus (like the idea that vaccines include microchips for tracking people), the company may also delete the tweet, which counts as two strikes. From there, account-level strikes accrue, triggering different actions from Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLlLzi"&gt;Appending labels has been part of the larger strategy to fight misinformation Twitter used during the 2020 election, adding labels to tweets from politicians — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;including the former president&lt;/a&gt; — when they included inaccurate information. While the labels seem helpful, they don’t necessarily deter people from sharing the information. Holding real punishment like a suspension until there have been five bad tweets also means that misinformation could spread with only some text as a warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpjMDX"&gt;You can see Twitter’s various punishments for the different number of strikes below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1AD8G3"&gt;One strike: no account-level action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zISbEb"&gt;Two strikes: 12-hour account lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OeJ2DN"&gt;Three strikes: 12-hour account lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="icX1YB"&gt;Four strikes: 7-day account lock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FQiStj"&gt;Five or more strikes: permanent suspension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dSDUoY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: this is your last chance to grab these Mario games for your Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35C4L1vnZ8kEK9qL9LnToRkUYw0=/159x0:1797x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893895/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_4.25.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEXDO3"&gt;It’s March, which means Nintendo will soon pull a handful of games released specifically for anniversary celebrations. Switch owners have until the end of this month, March 31st, to grab games before the developer pulls them off the eShop. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21778351/fire-emblem-shadow-dragon-and-the-blade-of-light-nintendo-switch-online-retro-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and the Blade of Light, Super Mario Bros. 35&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Game &amp;amp; Watch Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J82zK4"&gt;Similar to Disney’s infamous “vault” tactic — offering films for a limited time before they’re stuffed back into a metaphorical vault and become impossible to get — Nintendo announced last year that it would only offer certain games until this year. It’s unclear if the developer will rerelease these games further down the road or if they’ll remain unavailable indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHA8yU"&gt;Nintendo continues to celebrate Mario’s 35th anniversary with different events and cross-promotions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288246/animal-crossing-new-horizons-mario-update"&gt;Last month&lt;/a&gt;, it released an update in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; that added Mario costumes and items to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjnxZI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vez579"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdWVf1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A folding iPhone could be coming in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The dual camera system on the iPhone 12." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nx66yCszvvh2QlUkxEAsrq_gBUI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893636/vpavic_4243_20201018_0139.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqJ72b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;Rumors about a folding iPhone&lt;/a&gt; are nothing new, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18228861/apple-iphone-kuo-rumor-ipad-ipod-touch-airpower-airpods"&gt;who has a very strong track record&lt;/a&gt;) is weighing in with information of his own: he says that Apple could be looking at a 2023 launch, and that the phone could have a screen between 7.5 and eight inches (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;Previous rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the screen would be smaller, closer to the size of an iPhone 12 Pro Max.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKsKu9"&gt;There have been numerous reports about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233644/foldable-iphone-apple-screens-report"&gt;Apple prototyping a folding iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, but according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;, Kuo says that the product has “not yet officially kicked off.” Meanwhile, competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole&lt;/a&gt; have all released multiple foldable phones (though they’re mostly expensive and clearly early implementations of the tech). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7AoOv"&gt;According to Kuo, the screen will be iPad Mini-sized when folded out, so it seems as if Apple is going for the Galaxy Fold approach of having a regular-sized phone that folds out into a small tablet, rather than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price"&gt;Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; or Razr approach of having a compact folding phone. (This is a bummer to me, but it seems like the folding phablet approach is the most popular at the moment.) It’s unclear who would be making those folding displays — there have been rumors of Apple working with both &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/lg-apple-foldable-displays/"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryn334"&gt;While the rumors of a prototype and this report from Kuo indicate that Apple is indeed working on a folding phone, it’s not something to wait around for just yet. Kuo’s 2023 launch date is dependent on Apple being able to figure out “key technology and mass production issues.” As we’ve seen, folding phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;can be hard to get right&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple can do it, though, it could be in the position to do what it does best: adopt a technology after other companies have figured out the bugs and pitfalls, and release a product that seems polished in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon shaves app icon mustache that raised eyebrows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgKDOwPWLnwRqGYUTGFm0-yAW4g=/34x0:2550x1677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893611/iconcs.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The old (left) and updated (right) versions of Amazon’s new app icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmOe0l"&gt;Amazon has quietly rolled out a slight update to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249675/amazon-new-ios-app-logo-color"&gt;its new app icon&lt;/a&gt; that it debuted back in January, which alters the colorful strip of tape on the icon that bore an unfortunate resemblance to a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothbrush_moustache"&gt;toothbrush-style mustache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h230ED"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;lmao I completely missed that amazon quietly tweaked its new icon to make it look… less like hitler &lt;a href="https://t.co/Jh8UC8Yg3u"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Jh8UC8Yg3u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— alex hern (@alexhern) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhern/status/1366396140116131842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85uw2H"&gt;The toothbrush mustache was originally popularized by comedians like Charlie Chaplin in the early 1900s before it was forever associated with Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpmloE"&gt;Amazon made some changes to the icon following customer feedback from its initial rollout before it rolled out the final design worldwide. An Amazon spokesperson commented that “Amazon is always exploring new ways to delight our customers. We designed the new icon to spark anticipation, excitement, and joy when customers start their shopping journey on their phone, just as they do when they see our boxes on their door step.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Se8Nr7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10368265"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kTsolt"&gt;It’s a change that makes sense. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18112516/amazon-holiday-commercial-captain-america-winter-soldier-twitter-christmas"&gt;Amazon’s ads&lt;/a&gt; have portrayed the swooping A-to-Z arrow that adorns its packaging as singing mouths, and in that light, the ragged edge and width of the blue tape on the previous icon design looks uncomfortably similar to the tonsorial trim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeOzAi"&gt;The updated icon looks to avoid the issue entirely, swapping out the mustache-style adhesive for a two-toned folded piece of tape that alludes to the (presumed) joy of tearing open an Amazon package instead of one of the most brutal dictators in modern history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqfatg"&gt;Amazon’s design team can take some consolation, though, in joining the storied annals of modern companies that have been forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/16021794/superman-mustache-justice-league-extended-reshoots-henry-cavill-warner-bros"&gt;digitally shave controversial mustaches&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, the new icon is already getting much more favorable comparisons: apparently, the angular tape now makes it look like &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;’s Aang instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HcAMDj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;i know the new amazon app icon is supposed to represent their packages but every time i see it i just see Aang from Avatar smiling at me lololol &lt;a href="https://t.co/kIPwneHr2p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kIPwneHr2p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— flipboitamidles (DAMN%) (@flipboitamidles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flipboitamidles/status/1365353610939273220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqP1h0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 1st, 4:18pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Amazon comment on the updated app icon logo. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
