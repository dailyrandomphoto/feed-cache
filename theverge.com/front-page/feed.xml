    <title>McDonald’s is testing the ‘McPlant’ burger in Denmark and Sweden</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo of a burger, french fries, and a soda in front of a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRXM_ZTuhLLg-G9q0nnkXUolLVQ=/179x0:961x521/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68758038/McPlant_Burger.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The McPlant burger. | Image: McDonald’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkT16B"&gt;McDonald’s new plant-based burger, which the company &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/11/9/21556647/mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-is-the-mcplant-chicken-sandwich-wars-2021"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, has debuted for a trial run in Denmark and Sweden, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/mcdonald-s-quietly-rolls-out-mcplant-burger-in-test-markets"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed the McPlant, the burger features a patty made from pea and rice proteins, which was co-developed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564094/beyond-meat-new-burgers-plant-based-two-types-juicier-less-saturated-fat"&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFfdLp"&gt;The trials began in January and will last until March 15th in Sweden and April 12th in Denmark. The McPlant’s Scandinavian success will be evaluated before potentially rolling out to other markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PI9LO"&gt;The patty is cooked on the same grill as beef burgers, so it’s not technically vegan (or vegetarian, depending on your dietary strictness). Nonetheless, a &lt;a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/se/sv-se/newsroom/article/News.Recent.mcplant.html"&gt;press release from McDonald’s Sweden&lt;/a&gt; pitches the McPlant as the latest option for “flexitarians” — people who are loosely vegetarian but still eat some meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOHuXE"&gt;McDonald’s and Beyond collaborated previously with the &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/9/26/20885096/mcdonalds-beyond-meat-plant-sandwich"&gt;“P.L.T.” in Canada&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear if the McPlant partnership will continue past these early trials. “While McDonald’s will source the McPlant patties for the tests through Beyond Meat, it didn’t specify the suppliers for future roll-outs,” says &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aeoPk"&gt;The McPlant is the latest in a trend of fast food companies &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger"&gt;going in on simulated meats&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, Burger King, Dunkin’, Starbucks, KFC, and others have all dabbled with products from either Beyond Meat or its competitor, Impossible Foods.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is bringing back college football games without college players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NCAA Football 14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3RYwr-KYuD2UO5wPt3TxKvdUrU=/86x0:1015x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757817/ncaafb14_scrn_presentation_3_bmp_jpgcopy.1419979943.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NCAA Football 14&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cHNajs"&gt;After being missing in action for years, Electronic Arts announced today that it will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1356644353901539342?s=20"&gt;making college football video games again&lt;/a&gt;. EA is working with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC), a well-known licensing partner for many schools, to secure the use of over 100 teams in the FBS, including the stadiums, mascots, and uniforms used by these institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BNRLeR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football&lt;/em&gt; is currently in the works and still &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; early in its development cycle, with no launch window currently revealed yet. More importantly, &lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football&lt;/em&gt; won’t use any real names or players’ likenesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fPBSbv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For those who never stopped believing...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EASPORTSCollegeFootball?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EASPORTSCollegeFootball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2vDUYnbXEJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2vDUYnbXEJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EA SPORTS (@EASPORTS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1356644353901539342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qy0dme"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football&lt;/em&gt; will be the first college football simulation game released by EA after the publisher &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/26/4774646/ea-wont-be-releasing-a-college-football-game-in-2014-after-all"&gt;canceled the series in 2013&lt;/a&gt; after former college athletes brought a class-action lawsuit against EA for the unauthorized use of their likenesses in its &lt;em&gt;NCAA Football&lt;/em&gt; titles. EA would &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/15/11242004/ncaa-football-settlement-payout-ea-sports"&gt;reach a settlement in 2016 for $40 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Cc3wk"&gt;The announcement of college football video games returning comes at an interesting time for sports fans. Last year, 2K announced that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21172217/2k-nfl-video-games-madden"&gt;making NFL games again&lt;/a&gt;, with the first one slated to launch this year, but they would be non-simulation titles due to an existing partnership between EA and the NFL. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Super Bowl ad stars Michael B. Jordan as Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdPkp97XF_-3-UUGz3SCYlR_YkY=/105x0:1523x945/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757737/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_8.32.24_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6clUfv"&gt;Amazon is no stranger to Super Bowl ads, and the company has another one ready for this year’s big game. The 2021 ad stars actor Michael B. Jordan, who you might know as Erik Killmonger from &lt;em&gt;Black Panther &lt;/em&gt;or quarterback Vince Howard from &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;, as the company’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AJqys"&gt;In the ad, a woman dreams of what it would be like if Alexa was personified as the very handsome Jordan, and she’s appropriately smitten with the AI. At one point, for example, the woman asks Alexa to dim the lights, and Jordan takes off his shirt in response. (Her partner then humorously rushes over to demand Alexa turn the lights back up.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZ8bn5"&gt;The ad is a fun twist on Super Bowl ads that use attractive women to sell something. (Some of Carl’s Jr. and GoDaddy’s infamous Super Bowl commercials come to mind.) It’s all made that much better by Jordan’s terrifying eyes, which are the unnatural glowy-blue you might recognize from the rings on an Amazon Echo device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kltatk"&gt;You can watch a 60-second version of the commercial at the top of this post. A 90-second version is embedded in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazon/status/1356595348022689799"&gt;tweet from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ukdgCZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alexa's new body looks good. Maybe a little too good. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlexasNewBody?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AlexasNewBody&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelb4jordan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@michaelb4jordan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/snCNDivOiK"&gt;https://t.co/snCNDivOiK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rYLcQzZyjn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rYLcQzZyjn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Amazon (@amazon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazon/status/1356595348022689799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOUV4w"&gt;This isn’t the first time Amazon has used a celebrity to impersonate Alexa in a Super Bowl ad. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16954704/amazon-super-bowl-ad-alexa-cardi-b-anthony-hopkins-commerical-gordon-ramsey-rebel-wilson"&gt;The 2018 commercial&lt;/a&gt; featured the voice talents of Gordon Ramsay, Rebel Wilson, Cardi B, and Anthony Hopkins as Alexa when it “lost” its voice. And if you want to reminisce on many years of other star-studded Alexa ads from Amazon, here’s a list of the company’s past Super Bowl shorts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1beu7x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Amazon’s disconcerting Super Bowl ad makes real people respond to questions we’d ask Alexa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21115222/amazon-super-bowl-2020-ad-alexa-ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Amazon imagines Alexa in hot tubs and toothbrushes in its Super Bowl ad&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203747/amazon-alexa-super-bowl-ad-2019-not-everything-makes-the-cut&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Amazon’s Super Bowl ad imagines a world where Cardi B and Anthony Hopkins are Alexa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16954704/amazon-super-bowl-ad-alexa-cardi-b-anthony-hopkins-commerical-gordon-ramsey-rebel-wilson&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Amazon's first-ever Super Bowl ad will star Alec Baldwin and Alexa&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/27/10840532/amazon-super-bowl-ad-alec-baldwin-alexa-echo&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="50Znh9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You too can own a stonks figurine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yUBeDc_Jyo6EIJA81nmYcdPYZnQ=/0x0:1124x749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757567/01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3pmU3"&gt;He’s real, he’s here, and I am so happy. &lt;a href="https://youtooz.com/products/stonks"&gt;The stonks guy is now a five-inch-tall, $30 thing you can buy&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a line graph that’s forever up 69 percent. It first debuted last July, but don’t let that stop you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTQuhV"&gt;Officially his name is Meme Man, and he’s the wonky former mascot of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/756598251050956/photos/pb.756598251050956.-2207520000.1457643821./756599924384122/?type=3&amp;amp;theater"&gt;at least one surrealist meme page&lt;/a&gt;, though he began his life as &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/meme-man"&gt;a failed model of a human head&lt;/a&gt; over at 4chan’s 3D modeling board. Meme Man, however, has transcended his origins. You probably know him best in his banker config, confidently and wordlessly asserting that the Line Will Go Up and that numbers, by extension, can be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aajEDYims8yC2kjo8DzmVZE2tS4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275799/926e5009_c10a_48fe_b90e_fa0760f82fcd.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lbuPqt"&gt;I’m not gonna lie to you: I have never wanted anything so dumb so badly before. Possibly that’s because of the climate. A pack of wild redditors &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html"&gt;nearly bankrupted at least one hedge fund last week&lt;/a&gt;; the memes (and Meme Man) were naturally omnipresent. The frenzy of posts was intoxicating, and people were hopeful that by buying GameStop stock they might change the balance of our hopelessly broken financial system. It wasn’t silly, either; hope springs eternal from the human breast, and what’s a market if not the reification of people’s hopes and desires? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPtpo2"&gt;Anyway, Youtooz, the company behind the figurine, has written an incredible backstory for their product. “On the NASDANQ ^ NDQA 0.69USD (+69%), it’s always a bull run. Standing at five inches tall, Stonks has been immortalized in vinyl form,” the company writes. “Dressed in a black tailored suit and tie, you can be sure that this investor knows what he’s talking about.” And they’re right. Who knows more about the stock market than a guy in a black suit and tie? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkvRE4"&gt;However, the situation seems a little dark, at least for today. $GME is down many, many percentage points; it looks like the frenzy is starting to calm, and that the lines are righting themselves. Things are returning to the mean. The correct lines are going up again, and the invisible hand has returned to its invisible position. (It had previously halted trading on GameStop stock in Robinhood because of that app’s liquidity crisis brought on by retail redditors.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtY26O"&gt;The stonks guy, however, holds. Because playing the market isn’t about today — it’s about tomorrow, and the day after that, and the months and weeks and years it takes for storylines about property and capital to play out. The market is about the belief in a better future for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;; investing is a fundamentally individual pursuit. The stock market is as good a place as any to place your fears and dreams about the future, though its abstraction might prevent you from looking at the world around you and wondering how everything was assigned its value. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Millions is giving away $1 million — but who’s the real winner?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuGOyoNIk5Xu298d6zOuPnveu6c=/0x70:1440x1030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757496/Millions_Ticket.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z5tgeB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://millions.app/"&gt;Millions is a new startup&lt;/a&gt; with a big promise: simply pick six numbers on its website, follow the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/millions"&gt;@Millions Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, and you could win $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7eYYuk"&gt;It’s not some kind of scam, either: it’s being funded by same big names, like Biz Stone (one of the co-founders of Twitter), Joey Zwillinger (an Allbirds co-founder), Dave Gilboa and Neil Blumenthal (co-founders and CEOs of Warby Parker), Jeff Raider (who helped found both Warby Parker and Harry’s), and Daniel Greenberg (who helped found the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21320127/mschf-products-jesus-shoes-puff-chicken-office-business"&gt;viral internet firm MSCHF&lt;/a&gt;) among others. And the company — whose actual team is staying anonymous for now — is going to do 10 lottery drawings for the big $1 million prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4sAxv"&gt;It sounds too good to be true. A free million-dollar giveaway being run by an anonymous new internet startup, all for just following them on Twitter? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRddex1fg7_qqHbwR5D38Vi3hTk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268714/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_2.50.13_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PWMEsp"&gt;Well, that’s because it sort of is: Millions isn’t promising to actually give away $1 million. It’s effectively holding a standard pick-six lottery, similar to things like the &lt;a href="https://www.powerball.com/games/home"&gt;Powerball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play"&gt;Mega Millions&lt;/a&gt; lotteries. &lt;em&gt;If &lt;/em&gt;someone actually wins that lottery, the company will pay up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jEijp"&gt;But it turns out, that’s a big &lt;em&gt;if.&lt;/em&gt; The Millions lottery is actually &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; much&lt;/em&gt; harder to win than even the biggest real-world games because it has users pick six balls from 1-99, instead of the 1-69 or 1-70 pools that the traditional games require. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T03Cxf"&gt;It’s not a perfect analog since both Powerball and Mega Millions have players match five balls, and then also correctly guess a 1-26 or 1-25 Powerball / Mega Ball number, instead of a straight pick-six format here, but the odds speak for themselves. Winning the Powerball jackpot is about a one in 292,201,338 chance. Winning the grand prize in the Mega Millions lottery is about one in 302,575,350. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zbdRIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Winning the $1 million jackpot in Millions is 1 in 1,120,529,256 chance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JieTEa"&gt;Winning the $1 million jackpot in Millions? One in 1,120,529,256. Mathematically speaking, your chance of winning a major lottery (already infinitesimally small) is still nearly&lt;em&gt; three times as likely&lt;/em&gt; as winning the jackpot in Millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxlKd4"&gt;Of course, the organizers behind Millions seem well aware of this: when asked about the low chances, the Millions organizers told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the “odds of winning the Weekly Prize are slim. But hey, all it costs is a Twitter follow!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJpolo"&gt;Looking at the official rules, the $1 million prize isn’t even listed as the “grand prize” of the competition. It’s a secondary, weekly prize that the company will give out if — and only if — someone hits the over one in a billion shot of matching all six numbers in one of the 10 weekly drawings. On the off chance that multiple winners hit that number somehow, it’ll get divided up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsarvq"&gt;The “real” prize is a far more modest $10,000, which will be randomly given to one of the entrants at the end of the 10 weeks — a sizable prize, to be sure, but a far cry from $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbi8Ty"&gt;The difference, of course, is that even with Millions’ one-in-a-billion odds, it’s still free to enter. Buying a lottery ticket costs $2; entering the Millions giveaway is free — or at least, free in terms of actual money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIuBL8"&gt;So, why bother? Well, because it seems that the actual point of Millions is to build up a brand and Twitter presence for the new company. The initial $1,000,000 giveaway is just the theoretical starting point; as the site explains, “Millions builds products that give away money to people. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Millions"&gt;@Millions&lt;/a&gt; is the first of such experiences.” The company has already been giving away smaller prizes on Twitter for the past several weeks as a soft launch, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBYSri"&gt;In essence, the big Millions giveaway is just another standard lottery — but instead of buying a ticket with cash, you’re paying with a Twitter follow and your contact information, valuable data that the company can use to help build its brand and launch future products down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj3usn"&gt;Millions could easily parlay this first venture into hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Twitter followers, all for the low cost of $10,000. And it’s easy to imagine future lotteries that then leverage that user base down the line for other ventures that may actually make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7ZeaJ"&gt;Of course, someone might win that $1 million prize. Millions is doing 10 drawings, one every week over the next ten weeks. Depending on how popular the service gets and how lucky everyone is, someone could actually get paid. But the odds are certainly not in anyone’s favor — except for Millions’, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s ‘recently deleted’ feature lets you change your mind about deleting a post</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vfP2kGzAgjMJyc1NrFLv__e5ttI=/308x0:2108x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757513/Screen_Shot_2021_02_02_at_9.17.13_AM__1_.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ZsiAN"&gt;Instagram is making it easier to bring back deleted posts. The company is rolling out a “recently deleted” feature in the app that’ll allow you to review content you’ve deleted, including photos, videos, reels, IGTV videos, and stories, and restore them. Instagram is positioning this feature as helpful against hacks, particularly if hackers gain control of an account and start deleting content. Starting today, users will need to confirm they’re the account owner through either text or email in order to permanently delete or restore content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFAPUG"&gt;Deleted items will stay in the folder for 30 days, and if not touched, they will automatically delete after that point. Deleted stories are the exception, however: they will only stay in the recently deleted section for 24 hours before they’re permanently removed. To access the folder, navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Account &amp;gt; Recently Deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqelnN"&gt;Clearly, Instagram wants to give people chances to keep their content before permanently removing it. The app already offers an archive, or a way to keep posts without them being publicly available, and with this feature, it’s allowing people to keep their posts as an option, even if they want to initially delete them. Instagram benefits from having more content, and thereby more data, on users. The more it can encourage people to keep their posts, the better it is for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6j79qN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 2/2, 12:22 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story initially stated that users need to confirm they’re the account holder in order to access the feature in general, but they actually only need to do so to permanently delete or restore content. We’ve updated to reflect this change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition cuts multiplayer in favor of single-player improvements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Po-a5wtjsREc_Fob1jw3mwe1x44=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757109/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__EDENPRIME_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnEauq"&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;enhanced remake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;trilogy arrives, it won’t include multiplayer. According to longtime &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;developer Mac Walters, the team would have had to put in an immense amount of effort to bring the feature to the &lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;. “At some point we had to draw a line,” the project director said in a briefing about the game. “We’ve talked about doing the remaster for some time now, and at least at one point in time everything was on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2riBX"&gt;BioWare introduced multiplayer to the final installment of the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;. Although “these aren’t insurmountable challenges,” Walters said, they would have required focus on features outside of the single-player experience: how to incorporate crossplay or what to do with people who still play &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer today. “How do we honor that, how do we bring them in, can we somehow bridge that gap,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pIcsF"&gt;When the game launched in 2012, multiplayer served a narrative purpose as well. The game’s ending is partly dependent on the player’s “galactic readiness,” a combination of factors like player choice, resources, and success in competitive matches; a high readiness level helps usher in the game’s top-tier endings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nEzPy"&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Walters said the game has been rebalanced. Not only is multiplayer removed as a factor, but players who choose to skip directly to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3 &lt;/em&gt;without playing previous games won’t be penalized. “It is intended to get those best endings, or the higher tier endings — I won’t say which one is best or worst — but obviously playing will be easier,” he said. “We just basically took that section out and redistributed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4n6s4F"&gt;Although some players might be disappointed by the game’s missing multiplayer, Walters said that, ultimately, it came down to creating the best-possible cohesive story experience. “The overall &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; is a better representation of the original trilogy because we’re able to focus on those single-player moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBfEa6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BioWare is finally improving Black character customization in Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xPHm34M9UYCjnh46wCb39zS3TUE=/559x0:3799x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757137/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__OMNIBLADE_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sAMgYe"&gt;Although the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; trilogy allowed players to create their own Shepard, the game had  limited options for making non-white characters. Environment and character director Kevin Meek told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that improving options for people of color was one of its top priorities when it came to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming remastered collection. “If you have type 4 hair or a really dark skin tone or if that’s the Shepard you wanted to play as, you just did not really have that option in the original Mass Effect,” Meek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWMsS7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; packages all three games with all of their corresponding DLC. Although the game won’t add new story content, it does overhaul its graphics and expand some gameplay elements to make them more modern. In returning to the series, BioWare had an opportunity to fix its shortcomings in the game’s original design. “There are certain hairstyles that just don’t work, especially for the female Shepards,” Meek said. “There was very little there that supported that at all. There was long flowing hair options, you can color it black, but those didn’t really work.” The team began by making a list of hairstyles it was missing, then working out textures. “You can’t put a really tight, really clean buzzed cut with shiny, shiny hair,” Meek said by way of example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tak0iU"&gt;In deciding which hairstyles to incorporate into a modernized game set in the future, the developers aimed for more “timeless” options. “The difference between style and fashion,” Meek said. Part of the improvements to the game’s fade hairstyles, for example, includes “sci-fi futuristic patterns” buzzed into the sides. “You don’t want to grab people’s attention, you just want it to fit within the &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdNDYL"&gt;In addition to new hairstyles, skin tones, and more, the game is also improving on its “iconic” FemShep — a player-voted model that didn’t appear until the trilogy’s final installment. The canon character model’s late inclusion was “really limiting” for many players. “It’s pretty unfair for the people playing as females, you go through all of these moments throughout &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; and then you get to &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; and you’re just given this choice of do you want to continue with your Shepard, or do you want to switch your visuals completely,” Meek said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v94a6I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Asffpw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QnMcR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition won’t add new content — or more gay romances</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3xWK-nyyZImHZKQ07Ml6jHDxF8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757112/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition__THANE_3840x2160_LEGENDARY.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gmkUk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will stick to a faithful retelling of the game’s story and already-made DLC, with no new narrative elements on the way. Speaking about the enhanced trilogy during a briefing, project director Mac Walters said while the team did consider incorporating new content, ultimately, BioWare decided against it. “Honestly we had looked at, is there stuff on cutting room floors and things like that that we could bring in?” Walters said. “And a lot of times that isn’t really in a state where you can just resurrect it and use it. It actually would require rebuilding from scratch and at that point you’re diverting effort away from the remastering of everything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pchLBR"&gt;That also applies to hopes that the game might incorporate more queer romance options. “We’re not changing anything in the story or the way the characters or the plot points worked out,” Walters told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a separate interview. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-2-jack-gay-pansexual-fox-news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt;’s crewmate, Jack, was originally conceived as pansexual. &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2 &lt;/em&gt;writer Brian Kindregan told the outlet that “the short version is, a lot of us were asked pretty late to focus the relationships on a more traditional kind of vector.” On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GameAnim/status/1354195336953139201"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, former BioWare cinematic animator Jonathan Cooper said that another crewmate, Jacob, was also once intended to be romanceable for same-sex characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Fgzr2"&gt;Asked about the allegedly cut relationships, Walters said that “no one ever said we couldn’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gs5EZ"&gt;“Honestly the writing team generally, and all the creators, are given a ton of freedom in bringing their vision — obviously we compromise with each other,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You work together to sort of build a great character or story moment or something like that and there’s compromise there.” In regards to media scrutiny from outlets like Fox News, Walters said that it would have “probably spurred us on to do other things” in the series. “No one has ever come to me and said we can’t do this because the media says so,” Walters said. “Never.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV09uB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will launch May 14th on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition brings a much-needed overhaul to the trilogy on May 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-HzZPQ9RW1pK6BILGjP7GjzxY8=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68757117/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition___REAPERS_3840x2160.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjwzN4"&gt;Remastering a series like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; — not quite a full remake of the trilogy, but more substantial than a port — is a thorny task. It requires work on all three games and dozens of downloadable content packs. There are fan expectations, from players who want to see a beloved universe preserved to those who are still salty about how it all ended. As Mac Walters, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition &lt;/em&gt;project director, put it: “We talk about it sort of like we were restoring a beautiful, beloved car. But then it quickly turned into sure, if that car had been buried in cement, and every time you tried to clear off some of the cement you were worried about dinging the paint, or ripping off a mirror.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmCeuE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21518322/mass-effect-legendary-edition-original-trilogy-remaster-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, coming May 14th for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and backwards-compatible with current consoles, packages the Shepard trilogy into one game. That includes over 40 DLC packs released during the series’s run, as well as &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/5/2927531/mass-effect-3-extended-cut-announced"&gt;extended cut&lt;/a&gt;. The game’s story will stay intact, including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/5/2927769/bioware-mass-effect-3-finale"&gt;controversial ending&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking about the extended cut of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt;, Walters referred again to developers caught in a cycle of always wanting to fix one last thing. “The extended cut was really that opportunity for us to add a little bit more love and a little bit more context around the ending,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sziJGK"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; game launched in 2007, and the final game came out in 2012. There are more than a few elements of the game that are dated. “The opportunity now to be able to go back with all of those lessons learned and with all of the advancements … [has] been a dream for me,” Walters, a longtime developer on the original series, said. That includes returning to familiar characters and worlds. “You don’t often get a chance to revisit a lot of these things.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9puXb4i-9PMXav1gw1uq8V4MPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268932/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition_ILLUSIVEMAN_3840x2160.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lSL6BB"&gt;When it comes to making games, Walters said that developers have to learn to eventually let go. “You have to kind of say we’re done with the game and we’re moving on.” With &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; being a trilogy, the team was able to take that “developer angst” and use it for the next game. “Over the course of three games, we were fortunate enough to sort of build on that and really bring the game and the franchise kind of to where we saw it in our minds’ eye at the very beginning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnQoKV"&gt;In the new remaster, all three entries can be accessed from a single menu, with players able to start from any game they choose. The tweaks range from a more convenient, comical ability to skip through elevator rides faster to overhauling the look of entire levels like Eden Prime, the very first world players are introduced to in &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1&lt;/em&gt;. “Ultimately what this was about was bringing this forward onto the current gen and for future generations as well, with the kind of fidelity and taking off some of the edges that people would expect with that,” Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xMcUg5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eyelashes like spider legs or potato-shaped heads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U6kVVX"&gt;The changes throughout the series, especially in the first game, are hard to miss. In a presentation offering a direct comparison, characters who previously had curious features — eyelashes like spider legs or potato-shaped heads — now look sleek. Game textures, a well-known buggy feature of &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 1,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, have been fixed to actually resemble the materials they’re meant to be. The team has apparently squashed hundreds of bugs that stuck around throughout the original trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVSpbZ"&gt;“It wasn’t that long ago that if you made a very expansive, large playbox kind of game, you could be excused for all sorts of bugs,” Walters told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a separate interview, reflecting on the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/16/14944840/mass-effect-andromeda-animations-final"&gt;memeable nature&lt;/a&gt; of bugs these days. “They expect a lot. They expect us to do our jobs, and part of our jobs is shipping a game to quality, bug-free as much as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GTbiUA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8i53TtQ6IQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T9lbf1"&gt;But it’s not always so simple. Walters compares it to trying to take a family photo with every relative, plus their pets. “You can imagine that you’re gonna take about 1,000 photos near the end, and one of them’s going to work. That’s the one you ship, and it’s as close as possible.” But look closely, and you start to see that someone has their eyes closed. And in the photos before and after, someone’s passed out in the background. “There’s a lot of challenge there, but no excuse,” Walters said. “I think the expectation from fans more and more is that you ship a quality game period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy2QJ0"&gt;As for whether he enjoys all of those memes? “It’s funny if it’s someone else’s bug,” Walters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHDhXH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
