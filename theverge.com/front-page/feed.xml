    <title>The Xbox Wireless headset includes Game Pass Ultimate at eBay for $107</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HutEmf"&gt;Over at eBay, the seller antonline (with a 98.7 percent positivity rating) has Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless headset in stock. This accessory has been tricky to find in stock, and what’s notable is that the price isn’t inflated. What’s more, you’re getting a better deal here since it includes a free one-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. All in all, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F124796256296%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F7%2F22566572%2Fxbox-wireless-headset-game-pass-ultimate-ebay-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’ll cost you $107 for the headset and the subscription&lt;/a&gt; (usually $115 together). The eBay listing says “limited quantity available”, so act fast if you want to snag a headset before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T76BgH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;This is the best wireless headset for Xbox owners to get&lt;/a&gt;. It pairs effortlessly with your Xbox One or Series S / X console (as well as PC via a USB adapter that’s not included), and you can also pair a phone to them with Bluetooth. Their easy-to-use dials let you adjust volume and tweak the game / chat audio mix to your liking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zbvf2t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxi0dd"&gt;Over at B&amp;amp;H Photo, the last-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro (space gray) with 256GB of storage is discounted. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F7%2F22566572%2Fxbox-wireless-headset-game-pass-ultimate-ebay-apple-ipad-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag it for $949&lt;/a&gt;, down $150 from its usual $1,099 price. That makes for a $250 price difference between the last generation tablet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;the latest model that has the faster M1 processor, support for Thunderbolt, and a Mini LED screen&lt;/a&gt;. Those might be nice features to have for some, but for those who don’t want to spend that much, this might be the deal you’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C4LZz6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTR8X4"&gt;If you want a no-frills M.2 NVMe SSD with 1TB of storage, Best Buy is hosting a deal on SanDisk’s Ultra 1TB model. Normally around $105, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733115867493280374" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $95 today&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, Best Buy frequently knocks the price down on this SSD, and this isn’t as huge of a price cut as Best Buy makes it seem. Outside of a deal, it usually costs around $120 or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBQtIe"&gt;I’ve noted this before in previous deal posts this SSD has appeared in, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/hww8re/ssd_sandisk_ultra_1tb_internal_pci_express_30_x4/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;folks on Reddit claim&lt;/a&gt; that this drive lacks DRAM cache, meaning it might struggle with maintaining speed while transferring large files. Still, it’ll likely be a good enough option for people just looking for a good amount of speedy storage without paying too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tDuUR4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10357138"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Cowboy’s excellent third-generation electric bike gets discounted to €1,990</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgJS-P2j5z5hM5m3EcDcb7FSciU=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550260/verge_DSC_0771_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="khz54d"&gt;Cowboy’s third generation electric bike, the appropriately named Cowboy 3, has received another discount. Going forward, it will now sell for €1,990 (£1,690), €300 cheaper than its original launch price of €2,290. That price includes mudguards, which Cowboy recently started including as standard, as well as free delivery in 10 days. This latest price cut comes a little over two months after Cowboy reduced the price of its third-gen bike to €2,190.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wLeUo"&gt;The reason for the price drop is obvious. The Cowboy 3 came out one year ago, and a successor, the Cowboy 4, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22417053/cowboy-c4-st-electric-bike-price-specs"&gt;announced in May&lt;/a&gt;. So yes, you’re getting a slightly older model without the new version’s improved powertrain or integrated wireless charging dock for your phone. But we really liked the Cowboy 3 when we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;reviewed it last year&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got helpful features like built-in crash detection, and it’s also remarkably sleek for an electric bike with a removable battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUJ62s"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Cowboy 4 is currently due to ship this fall. It’ll be joined by the Cowboy 4 ST, a version with a step-through frame. Both new bikes will retail for for €2,490 / £2,290.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google crowd out the competition with default apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-BajpgSWY_z9XLxnIOLTmw66pc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550154/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new study shows how Apple and Google’s preinstalled apps dominate their mobile platforms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wJfzM4"&gt;If you use an iPhone or Android phone, chances are the majority of your most-used apps were made by Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysNYXF"&gt;That’s the takeaway from a new Comscore study that ranks the popularity of preinstalled iOS and Android apps, such as Apple’s Messages, alongside apps made by other developers. The results show that the majority of apps people use on their phones in the US come preinstalled by either Apple or Google. The first-of-its-kind report was commissioned by Facebook, one of Apple’s loudest critics, and shared exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHrZWT"&gt;Preinstalled services dominate when it comes to basics like weather, photos, and clocks, according to the report, suggesting these categories will be difficult for other apps to compete in. Defaults don’t win out exclusively, though: Apple Maps and Music don’t appear on the iOS list at all, and Gmail makes the iOS list several entries below Apple Mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c5cAMz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for favoring their own services&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzYrnI"&gt;The timing, as Facebook likely intentioned, is apt: Apple and Google are increasingly under scrutiny for how they favor their own services over competitors like Spotify. US lawmakers are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;reviewing a new set of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to curb the power of Big Tech, including legislation that could potentially bar Apple and Google from giving their services the upper hand against rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvTGa"&gt;The pushback stems from how Apple and Google bundle their apps and services with their mobile operating systems in ways that some of their competitors think is unfair. The criticism is harsher against Apple, given that it more tightly controls the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and doesn’t allow developers to circumvent its App Store.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzrZxb"&gt;At the same time, it has been difficult to know how popular these preinstalled apps are relative to apps made by third-party developers since Apple and Google don’t disclose user numbers for their default apps. Research firms regularly track the popularity of apps that are available for download in app stores, but Comscore’s study is the first real attempt at charting how default mobile apps compete against other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="TCKt1W"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6523915"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tknLNo"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22313379"&gt;full interactive version here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9sO-_nhMbJmafmbNBALEFxq300A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702366/VRG_Data_Top20Apps_BarChart_Vert2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CDcIg6"&gt;To make the report last December, Comscore used data it regularly gathers from apps and websites alongside a survey of roughly 4,000 people asking about the default apps they used during the month of November. The results show that 75 percent of the top 20 apps on iOS in the US were made by Apple, while Google made 60 percent of the top apps on Android. The top four apps on both platforms were made by their respective parent company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hheye"&gt;Facebook is the only outside developer with more than one app on the iOS list and the only developer with three apps on the list for Android. Randomly, a staggering 78 million people used Apple’s Calculator app — more than the users of Gmail on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcH7KS"&gt;Facebook paid for the Comscore study to show the “impact of preinstalled apps on the competitive app ecosystem,” according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The social network’s executives have long criticized Apple’s limitations on third-party developers for hindering their ability to distribute mobile games and compete effectively with iMessage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iJJVIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple called the report “seriously flawed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBAsdA"&gt;Apple rejected the report’s findings. “This Facebook-financed survey from December 2020 was narrowly tailored to give the false impression that there’s little competition on the App Store,” an Apple spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In truth, third-party apps compete with Apple’s apps across every category and enjoy large scale success.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXdn9R"&gt;The spokesperson said the survey’s methodology was “seriously flawed in a number of ways” and that the results contradicted Comscore’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings#tab_mobile_apps/"&gt;April 2021 rankings&lt;/a&gt; on app usage. But those rankings didn't attempt to factor in the usage of all preinstalled apps like the Facebook-commissioned study did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVl9oD"&gt;Google did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MknSY7"&gt;Besides Comscore showing app usage in the US for a particular window of time, there are a couple of other quirks in its methodology to note: it did not include browsers such as Apple’s Safari or Google’s Chrome in the rankings or what it calls “embedded operating system features” like Siri. And results for Android weren’t gathered by specific phone manufacturers, meaning app usage isn’t broken out for Samsung phones relative to the Google Pixel, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="05S9u9"&gt;Still, the report points to the power platform owners have over what apps are used on their devices. It’s not just the app stores that serve as gatekeepers, but the phones themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Office UI now available for testers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2kZR74RcHr8nGtGIEP1HdkMFlk=/138x0:1623x990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550146/Zoomed_in_view_of_WXP_in_default_theme_in_SV.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Office UI.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WkGS9"&gt;Microsoft has started testing its new Office design today. The software maker originally teased its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332483/microsoft-office-future-ui-design-ribbon-command-bar-interface"&gt;design changes to Office last year&lt;/a&gt; before revealing last month that Office’s new UI is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554676/microsoft-office-64-bit-arm-windows-11-beta-insider-redesign"&gt;designed to match the redesigned Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; operating system. Office Insiders can now access the new UI for testing before it’s available to all Microsoft 365 users later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6BE4n"&gt;The main changes are a rounded look to the Office ribbon bar, with subtle tweaks to some of the buttons throughout Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Microsoft had originally teased more dramatic changes to its Office UI, which included moving toward more of a command bar instead of the traditional ribbon interface. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kw5nSHg3FFqHG-NlqabNzJoqjKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20103664/m365_vision_excel_HD.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has teased bigger UI changes for Office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ozeIAh"&gt;It looks like, for now at least, Microsoft is gradually bringing subtle changes to its Office design rather than fully ditching the ribbon interface. Microsoft is still working on adaptive commanding that will eventually see Office’s ribbon interface replaced with a toolbar that can be undocked to float nearby actions you’re taking in documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYmwuy"&gt;We’re expecting to see those changes appear on the web and mobile versions of Office first, ahead of any significant design overhauls to the main desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Microsoft said last year that these changes could take a year or two to roll out, so we’re only starting to see the first changes in time for Windows 11 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIlj9X"&gt;This updated Microsoft Office interface is available for testers on both Windows 10 and Windows 11. You’ll need to be part of the &lt;a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/"&gt;Office Insiders group&lt;/a&gt; and set to receive beta channel updates in Office settings. Once you’ve updated, a megaphone icon at the top of any Office app will let you toggle the new UI on or off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub’s automatic coding tool rests on untested legal ground</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a GitHub logo of a provider of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj3pRhKYa5qUE4yHbhEmIbsXT-c=/0x0:3888x2592/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550018/1231387819.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItMtla"&gt;Just days after GitHub announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555777/github-openai-ai-tool-autocomplete-code"&gt;new Copilot tool&lt;/a&gt;, which generates complementary code for programmers’ projects, web developer Kyle Peacock &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kylpeacock/status/1410749018183933952"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; an oddity he had noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKOT13"&gt;“I love to learn new things and build things,” the algorithm wrote, when asked to generate an About Me page. “I have a &amp;lt;a href=“https://github.com/davidcelis”&amp;gt; Github&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeEanH"&gt;While the About Me page was supposedly generated for a fake person, that link goes to the GitHub profile of David Celis, who &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can confirm is not a figment of Copilot’s imagination. Celis is a coder and GitHub user with popular repositories, and even formerly worked at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AUzXo4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not surprised that my public repositories are a part of the training data for Copilot”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YYRQBj"&gt;“I’m not surprised that my public repositories are a part of the training data for Copilot,” Celis told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding that he was amused by the algorithm reciting his name. But while he doesn’t mind his name being spit out by an algorithm that &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;parrots its training data&lt;/a&gt;, Celis is concerned at the copyright implications of GitHub scooping up any code it can find to better its AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbbGo3"&gt;When GitHub announced Copilot on June 29, the company said that the algorithm had been trained on publicly available code posted to GitHub. Nat Friedman, GitHub’s CEO, has written on forums like &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27678354"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1409914420579344385"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the company is legally in the clear. “Training machine learning models on publicly available data is considered fair use across the machine learning community,” the Copilot page says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ais6Cu"&gt;But the legal question isn’t as settled as Friedman makes it sound — and the confusion reaches far beyond just GitHub. Artificial intelligence algorithms only function due to massive amounts of data they analyze, and much of that data comes from the open internet. An easy example would be &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/"&gt;ImageNet&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most influential AI training dataset, which is entirely made up of publicly available images that ImageNet creators do not own. If a court were to say that using this easily accessible data isn’t legal, it could make training AI systems vastly more expensive and less transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fJLBv1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The details change when an algorithm generates media of its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sidyMb"&gt;Despite GitHub’s assertion, there is no direct legal precedent in the US that upholds publicly available training data as fair use, according to Mark Lemley and Bryan Casey of Stanford Law School, who &lt;a href="https://texaslawreview.org/fair-learning/"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; last year about AI datasets and fair use in the &lt;em&gt;Texas Law Review&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdB7mk"&gt;That doesn’t mean they are against it: Lemley and Casey write that publicly available data should be considered fair use, for the betterment of algorithms and to conform to the norms of the machine learning community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cg2jW"&gt;And there are past cases to support that opinion, they say. They consider the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/technology/google-books-case.html"&gt;Google Books case&lt;/a&gt;, in which Google downloaded and indexed more than 20 million books to create a literary search database, to be similar to training an algorithm. The Supreme Court upheld Google’s fair use claim, on the grounds that the new tool was transformative of the original work and broadly beneficial to readers and authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njyVJS"&gt;“There is not controversy around the ability to put all that copyrighted material into a database for a machine to read it,” Casey says about the Google Books case. “What a machine then outputs is still blurry and going to be figured out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAARqQ"&gt;This means the details change when the algorithm then generates media of its own. Lemley and Casey argue in their paper that if an algorithm begins to generate songs in the style of Ariana Grande, or directly rip off a coder’s novel solution to a problem, the fair use designation gets much murkier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRPmwe"&gt;Since this hasn’t been directly tested in a court, a judge hasn’t been forced to decide how extractive the technology really is: If an AI algorithm turns the copyrighted work into a profitable technology, then it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility for a judge to decide that its creator should pay or otherwise credit for what they take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdNq2u"&gt;But on the other hand, if a judge were to decide that GitHub’s style of training on publicly available code was fair use, it would squash the need for GitHub and OpenAI to cite the licenses of the coders that wrote its training data. For instance, Celis, whose GitHub profile was generated by Copilot, says he uses the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License, which requires attribution for derivative works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsKpEg"&gt;“And I fall in the camp that believes Copilot’s generated code is absolutely derivative work,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNAMcb"&gt;Until this is decided in a court, however, there’s no clear ruling on whether this practice is legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWipmf"&gt;“My hope is that people would be happy to have their code used for training,” Lemley says. “Not for it to show up verbatim in someone else’s work necessarily, but we’re all better off if we have better-trained AIs.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to fast forward through a TikTok video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ga0Y7iUpJ7UBfJb7SCL_sgEQwYs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69550013/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ibhOk"&gt;TikTok videos aren’t what you would call long, but sometimes you might want to skip a few seconds ahead — especially now that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;videos can be up to three minutes long&lt;/a&gt;. Or you may have a favorite moment that you want to replay, over and over and over... Either way, TikTok has recently added a way to go forward and back on its videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydh7Et"&gt;When you’re playing a TikTok video, look at the bottom of the video for a faint white line. You will probably not see it in all videos; after some experimenting, I found that I was mainly finding it in the longer videos. If you do see it, then you can use it to go forward and back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Q99wyA"&gt;You should also see a slightly thicker white line progress as the video progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LUOns"&gt;Touch the thicker white line and it will highlight, with a dot at the end indicating how far you are in the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ehjpzS"&gt;Press the dot and use it to move the video ahead or back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shorter TikTok videos may not have the white line." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hMDi_ra1DjSeN0ANXaIb9D-4po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702174/Screenshot_20210706_154801.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shorter TikTok videos may not have the white line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A bigger, better Switch screen is exactly what I wanted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8E7Bw9rRHzDVohygVGo5XCcokg=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69549747/Untitled_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Switch will be released this October.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SttNm7"&gt;At least in many of the corners of the internet I’ve been reading all day, the response to the OLED Nintendo Switch has not been all that positive. It’s no surprise, really — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;credible reporting&lt;/a&gt; had suggested a more powerful model with 4K output, but the final product features the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;same internals&lt;/a&gt; as the current Switch. If you prefer to play Nintendo games on your TV, the new version’s bigger OLED screen isn’t going to do anything for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pzizem"&gt;I’m still buying one, though. A proper screen upgrade has been my most-wanted Switch feature ever since the console came out, and now more so than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy2SDF"&gt;I swapped my launch-model Switch for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; when it came out in 2019. Most of the Switch’s appeal is in its portable nature, I figured, so why not go all-in on a sleeker, more compact version with an actual D-pad? Well, turns out there are lots of reasons not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q9uiyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Don’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565469/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-timing-chip-shortages-cpu-nvidia-tegra"},{"title":"Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564966/nintendo-switch-oled-display-ps5-xbox"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="at7H2s"&gt;The Switch Lite is perfect for a lot of games, but damn near unusable for a bunch of others. The screen is just too dang small to read all the text in &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;, or to make any sense of the action in &lt;em&gt;Astral Chain&lt;/em&gt;. Cross-save functionality would make it a great portable &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; machine for when I’m away from my PC, except that I can barely see what’s happening on-screen. And for obvious reasons, you can forget about &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juIp1j"&gt;It’s not like the regular Switch’s 6.2-inch display is vastly bigger, but it does make a difference, and at least there you have the recourse of playing the worst offenders on your TV if need be. The Switch’s biggest strength is the way it runs the same games in TV and handheld modes, but inevitably some titles are going to be better suited to one than the other, and the Switch Lite only gives you one option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEAEX6"&gt;The new OLED Switch should solve the issue altogether. It has a TV dock, of course, but even in handheld mode I’d expect the bigger screen to make the aforementioned games a lot more playable, without causing a noticeable increase in the size of the console itself thanks to slimmed-down bezels. And the OLED panel technology should, in theory, also make them look much better, with deeper blacks and more vibrant colors. The LCD panels in the current Switch models are adequate at best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVTLyKi0ljOaK1hcvE-m98nG3i0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703114/E5nez6yXMBcUNZ3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The OLED Switch’s kickstand looks to be much-improved.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgy1vp"&gt;This is mostly just about me regretting the move to the Switch Lite, but I think the OLED Switch could be a solid upgrade from the launch model too. The kickstand looks much improved, and the bigger screen should make it more practical to play local multiplayer games in tabletop mode. And according to Nintendo, you’ll get the same boost to battery life that was introduced with 2019’s refresh to the original Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dep8N5"&gt;I do have some reservations about the OLED Switch. At $350, it feels like a price hike considering the regular Switch has sat at $299 since its 2017 launch. I really hope the screen doesn’t use a PenTile-style sub-pixel matrix commonly found in OLED panels, for example, because that would probably look pretty rough at 720p and 7 inches. (My guess/hope is that it will use a full RGB layout, like the PS Vita did almost ten years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEyaFJ"&gt;Mostly, though, I’m just glad I’ll be able to play more Switch games again. The Lite caused my Switch playtime to fall off a cliff over the last couple of years, and although it is very cute, I’ll be happy to see the back of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is returning to normal after experiencing issues on Tuesday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Vm9DtfraPKvdj4wCShP5xIBDEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547917/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Id3eZN"&gt;The TikTok app “should be returning to normal” after it experienced issues on Tuesday, according to the app’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokSupport/status/1412579355973373953"&gt;support account on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iImJ0g"&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, I wasn’t able to log in to the app on either the web or my phone. When I tried, I got the following message, which felt like it was downplaying what was going on: “There is a small problem with the server, fixing it now.” Now, though, I am able to log in and use TikTok on iOS and the web as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vDyz4T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...Annnnnd we're back! Your app experience should be returning to normal. Thanks for bearing with us, everyone ✨&lt;/p&gt;— TikTokSupport (@TikTokSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokSupport/status/1412579355973373953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cHgXoK"&gt;During the worst of the issues, they appeared to be fairly widespread, with more than 40,000 user reports of problems &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/tiktok/"&gt;on DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOFhZw"&gt;There were also many people on Twitter posting during the downtime using the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tiktokdown?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#tiktokdown hashtag&lt;/a&gt;. I gotta say, the memes on this hashtag were pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSLpCl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 6th, 9:41PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: TikTok says the service is returning to normal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conservative social networks keep making the same mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hX8I-wtDg9JIz1B9Eu5fxZZnUIw=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69548863/us_capitol_5.1419979475.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;On the rise and fall of Gettr&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QSEfG0"&gt;One question I have wondered a lot over the past few years is &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/was-parler-inevitable"&gt;whether the rise of a large-scale conservative social network — a Fox News of Facebook — is inevitable&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;the rise of Parler&lt;/a&gt;, we finally got a good test case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ts4Yag"&gt;Here was an app backed by the Mercer family, who previously championed Breitbart News, Donald Trump, and Cambridge Analytica, among other conservative causes. It was promoted relentlessly by top conservative media personalities, including Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and Dan Bongino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGSF4j"&gt;And it arrived amid a contentious election in which mainstream platforms’ responsible content moderation — labeling and removing misinformation; promoting reliable information about how to vote — was castigated by many conservatives as outrageous censorship and/or interference with the democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DEN8j"&gt;Then came the January 6th Capitol attack. Parler had been rife with calls for violence leading up to and during the insurrection, and in keeping with the platform’s “free speech” ethos, most had been allowed to stand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple responded by removing it from the App Store&lt;/a&gt;; Google later followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LuvTgq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The moment now seems to have passed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bmWg1X"&gt;By May, Parler had fired its CEO, shored up its content moderation practices, and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440005/parler-apple-app-store-return-amazon-google-capitol"&gt; returned to app stores&lt;/a&gt;. But, as &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/conservative-social-media-apps-decline-parler-d73956ff-ad6c-4657-a0bf-8e8122fa7948.html"&gt;Sara Fischer reported in &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;, the thrill appears to be gone. According to data from Sensor Tower, Parler downloads went from 517,000 in December to 11,000 in June. It’s part of an overall decline in the popularity of alt-platforms — and in conservative media generally — since former President Trump left office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OQxlL"&gt;At the height of election fever, Parler indeed had a moment. But the moment seems to have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="P9AkqV"&gt;
&lt;p id="swzwUq"&gt;The withering of Parler has not dissuaded other conservatives from attempting to build something similar. On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/01/gettr-trump-social-media-platform-497606"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reported that former members of Trump’s team were behind Gettr&lt;/a&gt;, an app whose stated mission is “fighting cancel culture, promoting common sense, defending free speech, challenging social media monopolies, and creating a true marketplace of ideas.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqPNAg"&gt;This is more or less what Parler set out to do. (Like Parler, Gettr is also essentially a Twitter clone.) But Gettr, by virtue of not having been used to help coordinate a violent insurrection against the government, started with a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P87oG6"&gt;The slate remained clean for… a few minutes. It quickly became apparent that despite the involvement of former Trump spokesman Jason Miller, Trump himself had &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22559493/gettr-jason-miller-trump-app-social-media-facebook-twitter-free-speech-cancel-culture"&gt;no intentions of actually joining Gettr&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, multiple hashtags with racist and anti-Semitic slurs hit the app’s trending section, according to &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;, and multiple reports found a torrent of porn. (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-smut-is-flooding-trump-s-new-social-network-1847226591"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; porn&lt;/a&gt;, in particular.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IukZMR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A growing number of accounts on Jason Miller's new right-wing "Gettr" site posting "Sonic the Hedgehog furry porn" are being banned from the platform -- and now there is a push among leftist users to argue that "furry porn is protected under the first amendment."&lt;/p&gt;— Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1412423956993351694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBPbJ"&gt;Then the &lt;em&gt;Daily Beast &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpworld-app-is-bankrolled-by-fugitive-chinese-billionaire"&gt;reported that the whole thing had been funded by a fugitive Chinese billionaire&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adgodev/status/1410667547335217169"&gt;Gettr’s source code was found out in the open&lt;/a&gt;. Then &lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt; reported that a bug allowed hackers to easily download the personal information of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1412047951636140032"&gt;anyone who had created an account on the site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi8BHH"&gt;It’s all going so badly that you almost wonder if the app’s founders intended it this way, my &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/announcing-sidechannel-a-new-community"&gt;Sidechannel&lt;/a&gt; co-host Ryan Broderick &lt;a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-republican-social-network-filled?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNDEyNjIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM4MzA0NDM0LCJfIjoiZHhYckEiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjUyNTYzNjMsImV4cCI6MTYyNTI1OTk2MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTkzMTciLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.9ZXLxc9FMYPYNz7G2nStddoymPBPfgn8azGLCeh-NnE"&gt;writes at &lt;em&gt;Garbage Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="BkqAcc"&gt;I’m also beginning to wonder if all these apps are their own grift in a way. Loudly launch a site no one will ever use, claim it’s a free speech sanctuary for Republicans, do the rounds on all the right-wing news outlets, and wait for it to fill up with the worst people on Earth, refuse to moderate it, wait for Apple to ban it from the App Store, and then go back to the right-wing news outlets and screech about liberal cancel culture impacting your ability to share hentai with white nationalist flat earthers or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HocnLR"&gt;When I first read this paragraph I assumed Ryan was exaggerating to make a point. Given the extremely predictable turmoil that emerged from Gettr’s content policies, though, I wonder if there isn’t something to this: a false-flag social network, set up only to watch it burn to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="A51Eps"&gt;
&lt;p id="j28MwW"&gt;But let’s say the whole thing isn’t a put-on. What should we take away from the Gettr debacle, and the Parler debacle before that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JezqiM"&gt;Lots of questions about social networks are hard. This one isn’t. If you create a place for people to upload text and images, you have to moderate it — and moderate it aggressively. You have to draw hard lines; you have to move those lines as society evolves and your adversaries adjust; you have to accept difficult trade-offs between users’ well being and their right to express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L85FmD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apps like Parler and Gettr offered their conservative users an attractive mirage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="weZW6X"&gt;Apps like Parler and Gettr offered their conservative users an attractive mirage: a free-speech paradise where they could say the things they couldn’t say elsewhere. It never seemed to occur to anyone that such a move would only select for the worst social media customers on earth, quickly turning the founders’ dreams to ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KoSwXA"&gt;In a sane world, next-generation conservative founders would accept as a given that they would have to police their apps for racism, dangerous misinformation, and other harms. In return, they could use their editorial discretion to promote their favorite culture warriors, rig the trending topics as they wished, and possibly even attract enough advertisers to make the whole thing financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3P7YMW"&gt;To be sure, active content moderation is a necessary but not sufficient, condition for running a viable platform. Even if Parler and Gettr had scrubbed themselves entirely of coup talk and Sonic porn, enthusiasm for them may have waned for any number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzKe4N"&gt;But when you consider why these apps failed as quickly as they did, lax content moderation is surely among the biggest reasons. Most people will only spend so long in a virtual space in which they are surrounded by the worst of humanity. If Parler or Gettr will be remembered at all, it will be because they created networks for conservatives that not even conservatives could stand to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian hackers reportedly attacked GOP computer systems</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvWhrV"&gt;Russian state hackers affiliated with the group Cozy Bear were reportedly behind an attack last week on Synnex, a contractor that provides IT services for the Republican National Committee (RNC), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;. The attack may have exposed the organization’s information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLvpgG"&gt;When asked by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;a spokesperson for the RNC denied the organization’s systems had been hacked, but confirmed that one of its IT providers Synnex, had been exposed. The RNC provided the following statement in reference to the attack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hLZvbb"&gt;Over the weekend, we were informed that Synnex, a third party provider, had been breached. We immediately blocked all access from Synnex accounts to our cloud environment. Our team worked with Microsoft to conduct a review of our systems and after a thorough investigation, no RNC data was accessed. We will continue to work with Microsoft, as well as federal law enforcement officials on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fQkwN5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.synnex.com/news/press-release-details/2021/SYNNEX-Responds-to-Recent-Cybersecurity-Attacks-and-Media-Mentions/default.aspx"&gt;In a statement released on July 6th&lt;/a&gt;, Synnex further confirmed “it is aware of a few instances where outside actors have attempted to gain access, through Synnex, to customer applications within the Microsoft cloud environment.” The company claims it is reviewing the attack alongside Microsoft and a third-party security firm. Manipulating enterprise software that interacts with Microsoft’s cloud rather than going after Azure or Office products directly shares some similarities with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;the SolarWinds hack in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXnVJ4"&gt;And that connection would make sense: members of Cozy Bear working with SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html"&gt;are largely suspected to be behind the manipulation of the SolarWinds software for illegal ends&lt;/a&gt;. The SolarWinds breach potentially exposed information &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;from over a hundred companies and government organizations&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165027/fireeye-cybersecurity-attack-red-team-tools"&gt;compromised the tools of cybersecurity companies&lt;/a&gt; designed to prevent these kinds of attacks, like FireEye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOXGHD"&gt;There’s also parallels to draw between a breach of the RNC and the hack of the Democratic National Committee and Hilary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. That breach, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12259258/wikileaks-leaked-democratic-national-committee-emails-personal-information"&gt;the leak of thousands of emails on WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately led to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568660/russia-dnc-hack-indictments-gru-mueller-guccifer-dcleaks"&gt;the indictment of 12 members of GRU&lt;/a&gt;, a Russian military intelligence agency with connections to another group of ursine-inspired Russian hackers called Fancy Bear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CngieM"&gt;The RNC attack arrives among a flurry of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and companies in the US. The list is long, but in the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;insurance provider CNA&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22561252/revil-ransomware-attacks-systems-using-kaseyas-remote-it-management-software"&gt;IT software provider Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, have all been the victims of ransomware attacks. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests Cozy Bear’s attack could have used these ransomware hacks as a kind of cover, and even if they didn’t, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763608/microsoft-russia-election-hack-gru-phishing"&gt;attacking political targets is an ongoing problem&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t always end in a dramatic leak.&lt;/p&gt;
