    <title>Slavery and overfishing on the high seas can’t hide from these researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Thailand’s Seafood Industry Under Scrutiny" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eAlmsRq9hre23iBXgqGcAPYyBT8=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562296/507983002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fish are seen after being unloaded from a boat at the port in Songkhla on February 2, 2016. Around 100 people have been arrested by authorities in a recent crackdown on abuses involving Thailand’s multi-billion dollar seafood industry. The deep-rooted problem caused the huge global brand, Nestle in 2015 to admit that it had discovered clear evidence of slavery at sea in parts of the Thai supply chain.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Paula Bronstein / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kPTCzS"&gt;A tracking system designed to help ships avoid crashing into each other has become an important tool for spotting bad behavior on the high seas. Researchers can now put a spotlight on corporations that dominate fishing in unregulated international waters where it’s easier to get away with overfishing. And it’s giving us a better idea of how widespread slave labor could be on fishing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TGwzLM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E8VutY"&gt;Two recently published papers use this technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), to make high-seas fishing a little less mysterious. The first study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;One Earth&lt;/em&gt; on December 18th, traces the origins of thousands of high-seas fishing vessels back to big-time corporations that keep store shelves stocked with seafood. Other researchers use AIS to reveal telltale markers of forced labor on fishing boats, which were published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;). That all makes it easier to make companies answer for any abuses they commit at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlqfRq"&gt;The technology, the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), has actually been around for about two decades. Basically, vessels carry around a box that sends out radio signals that anyone else can pick up on. Those radio signals share information about the ship, an identifying number, and other things like its size, course, and speed. That’s supposed to help vessels spot each other so they don’t get in each other’s way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZIHS6"&gt;Satellites can pick up on those radio signals, too, giving researchers a new set of eyes on the vast high seas — international waters that make up almost two-thirds of the world’s oceans. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/14/7219261/global-fishing-watch-map-tracks-illegal-fishing-across-the-globe"&gt;In 2014&lt;/a&gt;, Google and environmental nonprofit organizations Oceana and SkyTruth launched Global Fishing Watch, an initiative to track fishing vessels around the world as a way to potentially prevent and hold vessels accountable for abusive practices. Global Fishing Watch, which is now its own nonprofit, uses AIS and smaller national vessel tracking systems to create a near-real time map tracing the movement of about 60,000 commercial fishing boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OWX999"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A game-changer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2ubRZh"&gt;That was a game-changer for Jennifer Jacquet, an associate professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies. She turned to Global Fishing Watch to identify for the first time seafood companies that own vessels fishing on the high seas. “Just in the course of my project, new technology enabled the research in a way that wasn’t there when the project began,” Jacquet tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Her team put together a list of the top 10 corporate actors in high-sea fishing in 2018, which includes Dongwon Group, which owns the popular tuna brand StarKist.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwoFo"&gt;“There are few laws and regulations that apply to the high seas, and that is being used by these companies to do whatever they want,” says Daniel Pauly, an acclaimed marine biologist who has documented the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771419307644"&gt;demise of fish&lt;/a&gt; populations around the world. He has pushed for a &lt;a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/a-global-ban-on-fishing-on-the-high-seas-the-time-is-now#:~:text=the%20High%20Seas%3F-,The%20Time%20Is%20Now,of%20the%20fishing%20industry%20itself."&gt;complete ban&lt;/a&gt; on fishing on the high seas. (Pauly is on the board of directors for Oceana but was not involved in Jacquet’s study.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgMu14"&gt;Modern-day slavery is another problem on the high seas. Up to 26 percent of 16,000 industrial fishing vessels were likely to use forced labor, the &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; study published today found. As many as 100,000 people are estimated to work on those ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUjwYn"&gt;The study authors used AIS data from 2012 to 2018 to study the behavior of vessels that had already been documented using slavery. That allowed them to see how those ships behaved differently from other vessels: they stay away from ports and spend a lot more time on the high seas, for example. The researchers used that information to build a computer model that can identify vessels showing behaviors that suggest that they might also rely on forced labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQfVBv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It could not have been done five years ago.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jkDJWt"&gt;“This research, this paper, it could not have been done five years ago,” says Gavin McDonald, lead author of that study. “There would have just been no way to track this many vessels at a global scale without Global Fishing Watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BM2hL"&gt;There’s still a lot of elbow grease that goes into turning the data from AIS into research that can have an impact on how responsibly the fishing industry operates. Data scientists at Global Fishing Watch had tried to automate this process in the past, but scraping the internet couldn’t get the same results. “You end up with one level, but you actually need to dig deeper,” says Nate Miller, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch who was a co-author with Jacquet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWYz8E"&gt;Jacquet and Miller’s team for this project did just that. One of their colleagues found that several high-seas fishing vessels shared the same address, even though they listed different owners. She searched for the address on Google Maps, zoomed in to see the sign on the building, and tied all those ships to Pacific Fishing &amp;amp; Supply based in Hawaii. It fulfilled one of Jacquet’s hopes for this study, which was to identify new players on the high seas since a lot of the spotlight so far had been on Asia-based companies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="eEUx4M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More transparency has already forced some companies to act&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r7tNg0"&gt;More transparency has already forced some companies to act. The Walmart Foundation funded McDonald’s study after a 2015 investigation by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/-sp-migrant-workers-new-life-enslaved-thai-fishing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/29784df39a66431a83e7c4ba2d2fcaaa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Walmart sold shrimp tied to slave labor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrWVGj"&gt;If the high seas aren’t so lawless in the future, we may have researchers like these to thank. Their work could inform a new treaty being negotiated by the United Nations. If it comes to fruition next year, it could establish protected areas in the high seas to safeguard marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdBPJ6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxaPHG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile won’t claim it has a more reliable 5G network following ad board decision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/931zRO0Gh-AIwkcC0fag7OjUwyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68562292/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWEAvQ"&gt;T-Mobile has been asked to stop advertising its 5G network as more reliable than the competition by the National Advertising Review Board (NARB), which investigated T-Mobile’s claims made primarily in an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F405228998&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F21%2F22193839%2Ftmobile-5g-reliability-claims-verizon-competition-nad#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad featuring celebrity scientist Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; after complaints from Verizon earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koZpLU"&gt;But the NARB also says T-Mobile shouldn’t have to mention the speed of its network when broadly discussing coverage superiority in future ads. T-Mobile has said it will comply with the recommendation. But it cast the recommendations as a partial win in a statement saying it “appreciates that the panel agreed that T-Mobile can continue to advertise its superior 5G coverage without qualification.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2X7Y2"&gt;T-Mobile’s compliance is notable because telecom giants don’t have to follow the recommendations offered by the NARB, which, as a self-regulatory body under the umbrella of a nonprofit organization, has no governmental regulatory power. For instance, AT&amp;amp;T flatly ignored a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;request it stop using its misleading “5G E” logo&lt;/a&gt; to reference a superior form of 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m4kXop"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile was using Bill Nye to tout its 5G networks as more reliable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TTIJbG"&gt;Today’s decision from the NARB breaks partly with the recommendation from the National Advertising Division (NAD), the other half of the self-regulatory body that oversees telecom advertising in the US. (The NARB is the appellate division, designed to settle disputes that arise when a company appeals a recommendation, as T-Mobile did.) The NAD &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/t-mobile-advised-to-stop-claims-about-5g-reliability"&gt;ruled in August&lt;/a&gt; that T-Mobile should have to disclose the speed of its network when claiming its 5G network offers superior reliability. T-Mobile appealed, kicking the decision to the NARB and resulting in a slightly more favorable outcome for T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aewelk"&gt;The video in question, one of a few starring Nye after he was hired by T-Mobile to be a king of 5G spokesman for the brand, features claims from Nye that Verizon’s 5G coverage, because it’s based on mmWave technology, has abysmal range equivalent to about the size of a bus stop. T-Mobile, because it was using much slower but more reliable low-band 5G, said its network had more reliable coverage while also making claims about superior reliability when compared to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqHc8g"&gt;“Other carriers have 5G signals that drop if you move two feet. That’s because their 5G is based around millimeter wave, otherwise known as high band. For instance this is how far 5G reaches with our carriers,” Nye says in the video, showing a small red circle around an outdoor bus stop filled with mannequins. Nye then shows how moving the arm of one of the mannequins holding a smartphone from within the red circle to outside it would switch coverage from 5G to 4G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6en6Ft"&gt;The NARB says T-Mobile should “discontinue claims and an accompanying demonstration that imply that other carriers’ 5G coverage is so limited in any area as to cover only the space taken up by a single bench.” The board also recommended T-Mobile “discontinue claims that imply that its 5G service is generally available in locations that have traditionally been challenging for cellular service” unless it’s willing to say what speeds it can achieve in those locations. Lastly, T-Mobile can’t imply that its 5G coverage is more reliable than 4G coverage, either its own or that of competitors’ networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Yahy7"&gt;Here’s a more in-depth explanation from the NARB as to how it came to the conclusion that T-Mobile’s claims were misleading: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zYegPw"&gt;The NARB panel determined that T-Mobile’s express reliability assertions would be understood as comparing its 5G network to 4G networks, and that this message cannot be supported based on coverage, as T-Mobile’s 5G network does not equal or surpass its own 4G coverage or that of competitors. Further, the panel concluded that, in context, the claim that T-Mobile’s low-band 5G signal is more reliable than competing 5G signals should be evaluated with at least some insight concerning network performance beyond coverage. Because T-Mobile offered no such support for its 5G network reliability claims, parity or otherwise, the panel recommended that T-Mobile’s 5G reliability claims be discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSteVE"&gt;Much of this is semantics-based arguing that arises as a result of just how messy and confusing the 5G rollout in the US has been. Because 5G has been distributed across different wireless bands, each with its own trade-offs between coverage and speed, the major US telecoms have gone to great lengths to cast their own networks as superior to the competition. This often coincides with the same ads trying to mask the complexity of what type of 5G is being delivered and just how materially different from 4G it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgwUWP"&gt;This has led to quite a few advertising disputes between the major telecoms, with T-Mobile and Verizon sniping at one another in ads and in complaints to bodies like the NAD / NARB. By the time most consumers are actually using 5G, which requires they have a newer phone and live in an area with reliable coverage, most of these pointless ad squabbles will likely have been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvLFiN"&gt;But that won’t stop these corporations from nitpicking one another’s advertising spots for any little discrepancy they can find, nor will it stop those same companies from complaining about inaccuracies from probably peddling one of their own in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Civil rights groups move to block expansion of facial recognition in airports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SlVLf6TwX4b3-NdL-Il6OICYKRI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68561466/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNcmW4"&gt;A coalition of civil rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union have &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/cbps-plan-to-expand-face-surveillance-at-airports-is-a-civil-liberties-disaster-in-the-making/"&gt;filed an objection&lt;/a&gt; to the proposed expansion of Customs and Border Protections facial recognition at land and sea ports. The National Immigration Law Center, Fight for the Future, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are also participating in the motion, alongside twelve others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8N6QX"&gt;Filed in November, CBP’s proposed rule would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188526/airport-facial-recognition-us-customs-biometric-exit-expansion"&gt;expand the biometric exit system&lt;/a&gt;, authorizing the collection of facial images from any non-citizen entering the country. But in a filing on Monday, the final day of the comment period, the coalition argued that those measures are too extreme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJAsA4"&gt;“CBP’s proposed use of face surveillance at airports, sea ports, and the land border would put the United States on an extraordinarily dangerous path toward the normalization of this surveillance,” said Ashley Gorski, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project, in a statement to reporters. “The deployment of this society-changing technology is unnecessary and unjustified.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9LCfJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The program “could enable systematic surveillance by other government agencies and foreign governments,” says ACLU&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0sd2bL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/comment-civil-society-organizations-opposition-cbp-nprm-expanding-biometric-data-collection-us"&gt;The filing&lt;/a&gt; raises a variety of legal objections to the expansion, in particular arguing that Congress did not intend to authorize long-term facial recognition when it mandated biometric exit tracking in 1996. At the time, Congress left the specific method open to interpretation, but the technology for algorithmic facial recognition from a video feed was not yet developed enough to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sz5yo"&gt;The filing also points out that CBP’s proposed collection is more invasive than a simple photograph. Maintaining a facial recognition system will mean creating face prints from the collected images, which will be stored for 75 years and “may be used not only by DHS, but by foreign governments and federal, state, and local law enforcement to identify individuals for a variety of purposes, far removed from the reasons for CBP’s initial collection,” the filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3XMQp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp006-ats-december2019.pdf"&gt;CBP’s privacy assessment&lt;/a&gt; for the project details some of those additional purposes, stating that photographs collected by the program will also be scanned against the terrorist screening database, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/tecs-system-cbp-primary-and-secondary-processing-tecs-national-sar-initiative"&gt;TECS alerts&lt;/a&gt;, and outstanding warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVDm8o"&gt;“CBP’s collection of faceprints could enable systematic surveillance by other government agencies and foreign governments,” the filing argues. “It could expose where people go, who they associate with, and even what they believe, based on the religious services, protests, or meetings they attend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ya70m"&gt;On a procedural note, the civil rights groups also argue the proposal is unlawful because of broader concerns over the appointment of Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. In November, a federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/federal-judge-rules-acting-dhs-head-chad-wolf-unlawfully-appointed-n1247848"&gt;ruled that Wolf’s appointment to the position&lt;/a&gt; violated the order of succession for active appointments, and overturned a memorandum from Wolf’s office as a result. It’s unclear whether this same logic could be successfully applied to CBP’s rule-making motion, which was not issued directly from Wolf’s office. Still, the issue is likely to shed further doubt on the proposed rule.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Zoom escape button is the holiday gift everyone actually needs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnrsryHO39ZZ1Jm9BEcMN28hfNc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68561178/staples_easy_button.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Staples&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kz896u"&gt;The worst part of most Zoom meetings is the end. Not because it’s the moment when we have to lose human connection after being isolated for months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end of a Zoom meeting is the worst because it’s so dang hard to quickly and gracefully end a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJyzbZ"&gt;With a typical not-Zoom call on a smartphone, you bring the phone down from your ear and tap the end call button. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKW4Qh"&gt;On a Zoom meeting, you say your goodbye pleasantries, put your hand on your mouse, find your mouse on your screen, move it in the right direction toward the end call button, overshoot said button in your desperation to leave the meeting as soon as possible, and then finally click the button, all on video, where anyone who is still in the meeting can see the growing desperation in your eyes as you go through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeJmDx"&gt;Brian Moore, a creative director at Anomaly, took it upon himself to make leaving Zoom meetings easier. He made a way to use a physical lamp cord that he can pull on to instantly leave the meeting. Just watch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield/status/1339257875034566656"&gt;this thing of beauty&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2fQWMX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always awkwardly struggle to get to the end call button on video calls. So I made this &lt;a href="https://t.co/4z4zsxNkeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4z4zsxNkeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Moore (@lanewinfield) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lanewinfield/status/1339257875034566656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kL5Xjc"&gt;And if this looked like something you want to have for yourself, I have good news for you: Moore shared all of the files you’ll need &lt;a href="https://github.com/lanewinfield/zoomout"&gt;to make something like it on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cbVhJ"&gt;Now I’m imagining other ways I could quickly escape Zoom meetings. Perhaps smashing a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2FStaples-Easy-Button%2Fproduct_606396&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F22193417%2Fzoom-escape-button-holiday-gift-brian-moore-cord-github#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staples Easy Button&lt;/a&gt;? Throwing a giant switch like what you’d see in a &lt;a href="https://gifteee.com/products/frankenstein-light-switch-plate-3d-printed-turn-any-room-into-a-mad-scientist-lab"&gt;campy horror movie&lt;/a&gt;? Or, like David Zhou, making a way to end calls &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1339600939980709893"&gt;after sighing loudly&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;inspired by this, i made a script that automatically quits &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@zoom_us&lt;/a&gt; when i sigh really loudly &lt;a href="https://t.co/tJUdSBPt1L"&gt;https://t.co/tJUdSBPt1L&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jzsh5BCi8p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jzsh5BCi8p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Zhou (@dz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dz/status/1339600939980709893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Netflix and Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate agree to dismiss lawsuit over Sherlock Holmes’ emotions</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EGPxlT"&gt;Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s estate and the creators of Netflix movie &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://copyrightlately.com/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?tnc_pvfw=ZmlsZT1odHRwczovL2NvcHlyaWdodGxhdGVseS5jb20vd3AtY29udGVudC91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjAvMTIvQ29uYW4tRG95bGUtRXN0YXRlLXYuLVNwcmluZ2VyLVN0aXB1bGF0aW9uLXRvLURpc21pc3MtV2l0aC1QcmVqdWRpY2UucGRmJnNldHRpbmdzPTEwMTEwMDExMDEwMTAxMTExMDAmbGFuZz1lbi1VUw==#page=&amp;amp;zoom=&amp;amp;pagemode=none"&gt;agreed to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; a copyright lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302942/netflix-enola-holmes-sherlock-arthur-conan-doyle-estate-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"&gt;over Sherlock Holmes’ emotions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://copyrightlately.com/enola-holmes-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copyright Lately&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the outcome today, noting that the court didn’t rule on the merits of the case, possibly indicating that the parties settled. So unfortunately, we don’t know if &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes’&lt;/em&gt; take on Doyle’s famous detective violated copyright by showing a wider range of feelings and greater respect for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHWDOP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; case hinged on Sherlock Holmes’ complicated copyright status. Most Holmes stories sit in the public domain, and stories like &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; — which reimagines Holmes (played by Henry Cavill) having a younger sister — can freely repurpose their elements. But 10 of Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories are still protected by copyright, and the Doyle estate argued that they depict a meaningfully different version of the character. (He’s more caring, less overtly contemptuous of women and friendship, and generally less of a jerk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVDrtC"&gt;Doyle’s estate claimed that &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; unlawfully used this copyrighted version of Holmes. And it sued author Nancy Springer, who wrote the original &lt;em&gt;Enola Holmes&lt;/em&gt; series of books, along with Netflix, Springer’s publisher, and the film adaptation’s production company. The lawsuit’s defendants &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/enola-holmes-producers-blast-copyright-infringement-suit-from-conan-doyle-estate"&gt;argued that Doyle’s estate&lt;/a&gt; was trying to copyright “generic concepts like warmth, kindness, empathy, or respect” — rather than any specific plot or character elements contained in those stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xD6kWN"&gt;This lawsuit has revived a complicated legal debate over Sherlock Holmes. But the detective likely won’t be under copyright much longer: Doyle’s final stories are set to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-sherlock-holmes-public-domain-20140805-story.html"&gt;fall into the public domain&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero Pro 6 review: less pro than expected</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Eero’s top-shelf mesh router is advertised for gigabit speeds, but it doesn’t quite deliver&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="I1efFs"&gt;Eero was the company that first popularized mesh networking for the home, fixing Wi-Fi for millions. It has built a reputation for its simple setup and minimal maintenance, reliably broadcasting a Wi-Fi connection throughout your home much better than a traditional standalone router could. Now that it is owned by Amazon, it promises to repeat that trick for customers who have access to gigabit internet speeds with its top-tier Eero Pro 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16pl2c"&gt;Fixing most home Wi-Fi problems doesn’t have to cost a lot. A basic mesh system can provide reliable Wi-Fi coverage in most homes without costing more than $250. If the speeds you’re getting from your ISP are 300Mbps or less, there’s no real need to buy anything more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VatBQS"&gt;But if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the privilege of access to faster home internet, such as what gigabit fiber can offer, you might want something more. That’s where high-end Wi-Fi 6-enabled mesh systems like the Eero Pro 6 come in. They can spread your fast connection throughout your home without having to deal with pesky wiring and let you take full advantage of the bandwidth you’re forking money over for each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFZ4aj"&gt;Earlier this year, I looked at one of the first Wi-Fi 6 mesh routers to see if it could give me better speeds on my gigabit Fios service than earlier Wi-Fi 5-based systems could. And it did: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283756/arris-surfboard-max-pro-wi-fi-6-mesh-router-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Arris Surfboard Max Pro&lt;/a&gt; was able to deliver more of the bandwidth I pay for to my devices, even if I wasn’t in the same room as the router. But each Arris node is a massive unit, the app to manage the router is clumsy at best, I ran into some frustrating reliability issues, and it cost $650 at the time of my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r06bWq"&gt;The $599 Eero Pro 6 I’ve been testing, on the other hand, is compact, reliable, and just as easy to set up as Eero’s lower-tier models. But unfortunately, it doesn’t bring the performance that justifies its price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uj0Xoh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10245537"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aY6ehT"&gt;Eero Pro 6 pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ao6yMm"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 system that I tested is the top-tier package, which includes three nodes and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-pro-6-3-pack/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells for $599&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s been marked down to as low as $480 during the holiday shopping season). Eero also sells single units for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-Pro-6-Router/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$229 each&lt;/a&gt; or a&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eero-Pro-6-Router/dp/B08KXCKC4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; two-pack for $399&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxMQxR"&gt;These pricing details are important because, frankly, every tri-band Wi-Fi 6 mesh system is expensive, and Eero is no exception. Compared to Eero’s prior-generation Pro model, the Eero Pro 6 is 20 percent more costly. It is also &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; more expensive than Eero’s non-“Pro” lineup, which starts at just $249 for a Wi-Fi 5-based system with three nodes (and can frequently be found for a lot less). Eero’s entry-level Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems are similarly approachable at $279 for a three-pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uCD0cv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is 20 percent more expensive than the model it replaces&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IiX0Xd"&gt;How many nodes you require depends on the size and layout of your home. Eero claims each unit covers up to 2,000 square feet, but that’s in a perfect scenario, which your home most certainly is not. My test environment is a 2,100-square-foot split-level home built in the 1960s, with the internet connection coming in on the middle floor. I placed the other two nodes on the lower and upper floors, where my home office and the bedrooms are. The Eero Pro 6 system allows for hard-wiring each node together, which you can’t do with the base Eero 6, but my home is not wired up to support this, so I have to rely on wireless connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="on0cj9"&gt;Eero is not alone in charging a premium for a tri-band Wi-Fi 6 based system targeted at those with gigabit internet service. As mentioned, the Arris system I tested earlier this year is $650, while Netgear, Linksys, and others all have options in the $500 to $700 range and sometimes even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVDl5p"&gt;If you’re going to pay more for faster speeds, you damn well better get them. You should be able to get the majority of your gigabit bandwidth throughout your home. After all, that’s the whole point of a mesh system. And if you’re thinking of upgrading from a Wi-Fi 5 mesh system, you should see a measurable increase in speeds to your devices. Basically, any mesh system on the market can blanket thousands of square feet with a strong wireless signal and support dozens of simultaneously connected devices. What you’re paying for here is the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPeCMQR7l2ExIrS8Iq-giA-Aqa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170468/dseifert_201213_4337_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is a simple-looking squarish white box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="18ZEHP"&gt;Eero Pro 6 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="x8qTny"&gt;Unfortunately, speed is where the Eero Pro 6 disappoints the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7S3l1"&gt;I tested the Eero Pro 6 using gigabit Verizon Fios service and compared its performance to the Wi-Fi 5 Eero Pro, Linksys’ Velop MX4200, and the Arris Surfboard Max Pro AX11000 I reviewed previously. As this is a live home network (aka not a lab) and I have a lot of connected devices, there are anywhere from 60 to 70 devices on the network at the same time, of which half a dozen or so actually support Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McaOfL"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 did perform slightly better than the Wi-Fi 5 version, but not significantly so. On average, speeds to my devices were about 10 to 15 percent better than the Wi-Fi 5 Eero Pro, averaging 300Mbps no matter how close to the router I was. Frustratingly, many times, my smaller Wi-Fi 6 devices, such as phones and tablets, couldn’t hit more than 200Mbps down, though they were able to double that speed on uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VZ48H7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pro 6 did perform better than Eero’s Wi-Fi 5 routers, but not hugely so&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rtcGVu"&gt;A note on Wi-Fi 6 itself: Wi-Fi 6 brings a long list of advancements to wireless networking, including support for many more connected devices on a single network, faster theoretical top speeds, and improved battery life on devices connected to a Wi-Fi 6 network. To take advantage of many of the features, such as the improved battery life and faster top speeds, you need to be using a Wi-Fi 6 device, such as a very recent smartphone or laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WmaOTd"&gt;Wi-Fi 6 is specifically designed to address the changing dynamics of home networks where more and more devices are connected at the same time. But to get that improved network management and reliability, every device that’s connected needs to be Wi-Fi 6. (Wi-Fi 6 is backwards compatible with the older Wi-Fi 4 and Wi-Fi 5 technologies, so everything you currently have will connect to it just fine.) That isn’t to say using a Wi-Fi 5 device on a Wi-Fi 6 network will ruin the experience, but you won’t get the full benefit of everything Wi-Fi 6 has to offer until all of your devices are updated to support it. For more detail on what Wi-Fi 6 brings to the table, go read my colleague Jake Kastrenakes’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work"&gt;breakdown of it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9ToL4"&gt;What Wi-Fi 6 offers right now is the ability for the nodes of a mesh network to send data to the main router faster than what was available over Wi-Fi 5. Those speeds can then be sent directly to your smartphone, laptop, or gaming console that’s connected to a nearby mesh node, even if those devices aren’t using Wi-Fi 6 themselves. You can get even faster speeds if you connect your computer or console to the mesh node with an Ethernet cable, even if you are a few rooms away from where the internet connection comes into your home, an ideal benefit if your home isn’t wired up for networking, such as mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhaqhA"&gt;With a desktop computer hardwired into one of the secondary Pro 6 nodes (which then uses a Wi-Fi connection to link to the main router a floor above), I was able to get download speeds above 400Mbps and sometimes up to 500Mbps, or about half of my available bandwidth. That’s a good 100 to 200Mbps faster than I typically saw from the Eero Pro 5 system, but still makes a lot of my bandwidth inaccessible. Again, upload speeds were much stronger, but when you’re downloading a massive AAA game and just want to get playing, fast upload speeds are a small consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXZRFO"&gt;The Linksys Velop MX4200, which has similar specs to the Eero Pro, performed almost identically, with speeds capping out at just over 300Mbps and most smaller devices not pulling more than 200Mbps down. That’s not enough of a difference for me to recommend spending $500 or $600 to upgrade from a Wi-Fi 5-based mesh system if you already have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5t0AQT"&gt;The Arris’ more complex antenna array did provide a significant speed bump over Wi-Fi 5 systems and both the Eero Pro 6 and Linksys units. My mobile devices were consistently able to achieve connection speeds over 400Mbps, while hardwiring into the remote node allowed me to see near gigabit downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oOfMIJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like prior Eero systems, the Pro 6 proved to be very reliable over weeks of testing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqire5"&gt;Though the Eero disappointed me on actual speeds, it proved very reliable, with great stability throughout my weeks of testing. It hops devices from one node to another well as I move around the house, and it’s able to handle the load of remote working and schooling that often includes multiple concurrent video calls without dropping connections or choking. 4K video streams are possible anywhere in my home, and I never had to worry about what my kids were doing on the network if I needed to make a critical video call or upload a large file for work. It bested the Arris in this respect, which often needed to be rebooted to get its mesh node to reconnect to the main router and had trouble roaming devices from one node to the other as I moved through the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idf8bD"&gt;But I was able to get that same kind of reliability with the older Wi-Fi 5 system and the same internet service, so you don’t need to buy an Eero Pro 6 setup to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9vZgW"&gt;My test results are far from scientific. I’m testing in a single home with a single service and using internet connection speeds averaged across a variety of speed test services as a metric, which network administrators would turn their nose up at. But while some folks might be more concerned with how fast they can shuffle files around their home network, the vast majority of people just want to have a fast connection to the internet no matter where they are in their home. It’s why you’re paying for a gigabit internet connection to begin with. Dong Ngo’s&lt;a href="https://dongknows.com/amazon-eero-pro-6-tri-band-mesh-router-review/"&gt; testing over at DongKnows&lt;/a&gt; shows that in file transfer scenarios, the Eero Pro 6 sits about middle of the pack, despite its top-shelf pricing. Numerous &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/jt49f2/megathread_eero_issues/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf"&gt;user reports on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; also complain about modest to no internet speed increases over Wi-Fi 5-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bG8WkC"&gt;During my test period, the Eero Pro 6 system received a handful of software updates (which are delivered automatically; there’s no way to force an update), including a recent update to version 6.1. Some users have reported noticeable speed increases with the 6.1 update, but after redoing a number of tests, the speeds on my network have remained consistent with earlier software versions, with the most noticeable improvement seen when I am hardwired into a mesh node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZVunxQc98OD80snx4xwCyQ1B8g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170472/dseifert_201213_4337_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Compared to other tri-band Wi-Fi 6 systems, the Eero Pro 6 is much smaller and more discreet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e8IUwW"&gt;Eero Pro 6 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fwYyQe"&gt;Something that the Eero Pro 6 has over all of its Wi-Fi 6 competition is aesthetics. The Eero Pro 6 node is so much smaller than any other tri-band system, which makes it easier to place in your home and doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb if you do have to keep it in a living area. It’s a little larger than the old Eero Pro and certainly not as discreet as the Eero Beacon, but it’s tiny compared to the high-end Wi-Fi 6 routers from Netgear, Linksys, and Arris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UjUn0"&gt;Another feature that sets Eero apart from most of the other Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems is you can mix and match the new Wi-Fi 6 units with older Wi-Fi 5 nodes. If you already own an Eero system and don’t want to wholly replace every unit, buying one or two nodes and integrating them into your existing network could be an appealing option, though you will only get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6 when you’re connected to one of the new nodes, which you can’t always predict or rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7A0YM"&gt;You give up some things, though. Just like the older Eero Pro, the Pro 6 has just two Ethernet ports on the back, one of which will be occupied by the cable coming from your modem. If you have any number of devices that you plan to hardwire into the router, you’ll definitely need to get a multiport switch. There is no way to hook up a storage drive directly to the Pro 6, either, as its lone USB-C port is used for its power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIZJr9"&gt;There’s just one LED light on the front of the Eero. It glows blue during setup, is a static white when everything is working as it should, and glows red when there isn’t an internet connection. For any more detail than that, you’ll have to go to the Eero app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h738jxIjz2kPauKxnnnxmeHoxqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170470/dseifert_201213_4337_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are just two Ethernet ports on each Eero Pro 6 node. Other routers offer up to four on each.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVZk8xrf6ToXI3xz0GZmh0fkXY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170473/dseifert_201213_4337_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lone visual indicator on the Pro 6 is a single LED that changes colors based on network status.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9O182"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is rated as an AX4200 system, which is an obtuse way of describing what its peak networking speeds are. That rating puts it in the middle of the pack of tri-band Wi-Fi 6 mesh systems: it’s the same as Linksys’ $499 Velop MX4200 but lower than the AX6600 and AX11000 systems from Netgear and Arris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="836nMn"&gt;As this is a tri-band system, the Eero Pro 6 supports three Wi-Fi bands: the standard 2.4GHz and 5GHz ones most Wi-Fi routers offer, plus another 5GHz band to allow the nodes to send data back and forth without competing with your device traffic. Unlike other systems, which separate device traffic and mesh node traffic between the two 5GHz bands, Eero’s system will just use whatever lane it determines is the most efficient, so it doesn’t have a “dedicated backhaul” band that others advertise. In theory, the two 5GHz bands should provide enough bandwidth for gigabit speeds to your devices, though one of them has half as many antennas as the other, which does have an impact on throughput. That’s why Eero’s AX4200 rating is lower than others, which offer more antennas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUYUUT"&gt;In addition to its Wi-Fi radios, the Eero Pro 6 has Thread and Zigbee smart home radio support, so you can use it as a hub for smart home devices, which are then managed through the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKM4qG"&gt;Eero Pro 6 app and setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TyXn1y"&gt;Setting up the Eero Pro 6 is just as easy and straightforward as the company’s prior models. You download the app to your phone, plug in the first node, and follow the prompts. The app walks you through adding the additional nodes, creating your network and password, and turning on features such as a guest network or Eero’s subscription-based security and parental control features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gXe7zW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10245547"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FZhyx5"&gt;Unfortunately, the app is &lt;em&gt;the only&lt;/em&gt; way to manage the network. Eero doesn’t offer any web interface at all, and using the app requires you to create an Eero account and have an active internet connection on your phone before you set up the network. This is becoming a popular trend among mesh systems — both Arris and Google’s systems work the same way — but Eero was arguably the first to popularize an app-only experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd3le3"&gt;The Eero app is also surprisingly limited, especially for a high-end system that’s ostensibly designed for power users. It offers very few network management controls, lacks things like Dynamic DNS, and doesn’t let you separate out the 2.4GHz network from the 5GHz one for greater transparency. It displays a list of all of my connected devices, but it does a poor job of automatically identifying them, so I had to go in and manually figure out which one was which through its IP address before I could apply parental controls or other filters to it. (Eero is not alone in this issue, every other router management app I’ve used struggles with it as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfWVVi"&gt;Most of these limitations are easy to ignore on entry-level mesh systems where the main thing that matters is reliable coverage. And Eero would likely argue that its algorithms are more effective at managing network load than the average person futzing with settings. Most people just want to turn the thing on and have it work. But on a $600 system that’s advertised for gigabit home internet service and has “Pro” in its name, the hands-off approach is frustrating and limits how much control over your own network you have. As it is, Eero offers the exact same app experience whether you pay $100 for an entry-level node or the full $600 for the top-tier system. It could do well to add more pro features to its “Pro” router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vuUdM"&gt;The Eero Pro 6 does not support Apple HomeKit, even though Eero’s older models do. I asked Eero, and the company said it is working with Apple to get it certified for HomeKit, but there isn’t a specific release date for it. Another option not yet available on the Eero Pro 6 is the toggle for “optimizing for conference and gaming” in the Labs section of the app’s settings. This is the closest thing Eero offers to quality of service management and is designed to prioritize devices that are currently on video calls or playing games. The company says it is working on adding it to the Eero Pro 6 in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VRia9H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to excuse limited network management features on a system with “Pro” in its name&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9qyS5C"&gt;Like its other routers, Eero offers some subscription-based services on the Eero Pro 6. These include ad filtering, malware protection, content filters, and access to paid apps such as Encrypt.me and 1Password. The base Eero Secure plan costs $29.99 per year and includes everything but the paid apps; the Secure Plus plan runs $99 per year and adds those apps in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91EBMg"&gt;I’m hesitant to recommend paying for either of these services, as competing routers offer content filtering and parental controls for free, both of which are table stakes features. The other problem is Eero is not transparent at all about what the threat blocks and security features are actually doing. It just shows you a report of blocks it made on specific devices but doesn’t say anything about what they were or what caused the threats. The ad filtering is also less effective than content blockers on your browser in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zefoqfLSIUE_iWTsuKlSklqh02k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22187624/eero_app_screenshots_4up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero’s subscription plans offer security features but provide little info as to what they are actually doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yuSg3N"&gt;The only way the subscription makes sense is if you were planning to pay for 1Password and Encrypt.me anyway, as the bundle is less expensive than parting them out separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYPzNH"&gt;Lastly, it’s important to note that Eero is wholly owned by Amazon and that using its routers requires an Eero account. You can further link an Amazon account to your Eero account to make use of Amazon’s Simple Setup features and the built-in Zigbee smart home hub. Eero outlines the data it collects in &lt;a href="https://eero.com/legal/privacy"&gt;its privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, and, well, it’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gKdbFS"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JqnwkkZ445LMOFk91wr6eKaG27I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170471/dseifert_201213_4337_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eero Pro 6 is a little larger and taller than the Pro 5 system it replaces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pvnsLj"&gt;Thanks to rapid iteration over the past few years, mesh routers have reached levels of maturity and accessibility that were unthinkable just a short time ago. (Eero’s first model, which arguably broke the door open on mesh Wi-Fi routers, came out in 2016.) That means if a company is going to charge a significant price for a router and claim that it’s ideal for gigabit connections and “pro” uses (whatever that means), it has to really prove that worth with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxQq3q"&gt;Unfortunately, based on my experience, the Eero Pro 6 doesn’t bring the performance I’d expect at this price tier. It’s slightly faster than the prior generation, but not nearly enough to make an upgrade worthwhile. And it’s not so much better or faster than the less expensive mesh router options currently available, even ones made by Eero itself. That’s not a huge surprise, as Eero’s older systems were never the fastest in the field, but I was hoping for a bigger jump in performance with the Pro 6 than I’ve seen so far, especially given the price increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOG06b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The smart buyer might want to wait for Wi-Fi 6E routers to arrive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ygC1oi"&gt;Eero isn’t alone here. My tests showed Linksys Velop MX4200 doesn’t carry its weight either. And even with the routers that do provide faster speeds, you compromise things like aesthetics, reliability, and features (not to mention having to pay even more). The Arris router brought the performance increases I’m looking for, but it’s bigger, uglier, needs more maintenance, and costs more. Wi-Fi 6 routers are still a new thing, only coming to market in the past year, and it seems like they have a ways to go before they are demonstrably better than their Wi-Fi 5 predecessors in everyday use cases (aka outside of a controlled lab).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s5Zexe"&gt;If you’re thinking of making an investment and can wait, my recommendation would be to do just that. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, which is the next step in the Wi-Fi technology chain, is expected to arrive in the near future and bring more significant speed and capacity increases. None of today’s routers (or devices) support it yet. But if you are in need of a mesh router right now, you might want to look at options other than the Eero Pro 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro will have a feature just like ‘spatial audio’ on the AirPods Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8A-neHYHIB9s8WRvBp5vE5mqcg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68560483/galaxy_buds_pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bzXf8p"&gt;With its upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro, Samsung is planning to counter one of the differentiating features of Apple’s AirPods Pro (and now AirPods Max): spatial audio. Spatial audio crams an immersive, surround sound-like experience into a set of earbuds or headphones. And it accurately keeps the sound source anchored to your iPhone or iPad, so if you turn your head, you’ll notice that the audio stays in front of you. Wherever you move the device, that’s where it’ll sound like the audio track is coming from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvogt9"&gt;But Samsung seems to be readying its own take on spatial audio. As is becoming oddly common, the company’s mobile Galaxy Buds app has prematurely spilled some of Samsung’s latest earbud tricks. As noted by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/20/samsung-app-leaks-galaxy-buds-pro-in-full-including-copy-of-apples-spatial-audio-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the app &lt;a href="https://github.com/ThePBone/BudsProAnalysis"&gt;was found on Samsung’s servers&lt;/a&gt; with screenshots and features for the unannounced Galaxy Buds Pro. One of those new software capabilities is referred to as “3D audio for videos,” and the app says this will let you “hear vivid, immersive sound coming from all directions so you feel like you’re right in the scene when you watch videos.” Yep, sounds like spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvgJ1GyDetRP6hFm_DzeRDqjFfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22187822/Screen_Shot_2020_12_21_at_10.34.48_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki3VJA"&gt;There’s also this note: “To get the best experience, keep your earbuds near your phone.” According to a teardown of the app, it looks as though Samsung will try to replicate the positional awareness / head-tracking aspect as well. Apparently, you’ll need a Samsung phone running Android 11 or newer for the feature to work. Other headphones (like those from Sony) offer 3D audio, but this is for music rather than movies from streaming apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldvPqn"&gt;The app also reveals that the Galaxy Buds Pro will have a “voice detect” feature that automatically enables transparency mode and lowers the volume of your audio when the earbuds sense that you’re speaking. Again, Sony has something similar to this on its 1000XM4 headphones where music immediately pauses when you start talking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYkQsb"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to be announced in January alongside the Galaxy S21 series at the next Unpacked event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A semester in solitude</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Many Universities in the D.C. region have announced that the Fall 2020 semester will be fully online." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EOesp3nT968pCFF6m_gE-XqIgBQ=/195x0:5184x3326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68560262/1228205402.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Newton /The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After spending the fall in their bedrooms, students say their mental health has suffered&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bazt3n"&gt;Georgina DiNardo’s first virtual class is at 9:45. It’s Introduction To Communications — she’s a TA, so she’s responsible for sharing her computer screen with the class to display articles and other visual aids. At 11, she has a short break — she walks around the room to stretch her legs. By 11:20, she’s back on Zoom for a macroeconomics class (as a student, this time). For the rest of the afternoon, she edits and writes for &lt;em&gt;The Eagle&lt;/em&gt;, American University’s newspaper, communicating with her colleagues in a pile of Slack channels. Then, homework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vLLg2"&gt;DiNardo, a sophomore at American, and her roommate have to negotiate space (they both have Zoom classes every day). One takes their shared bedroom, and one takes the dining room table. DiNardo prefers the former — it’s easier to focus in a small private space — but, “We kind of rotate on how we’re feeling.” Whichever room DiNardo ends up in, she’s there the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Zb46m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Due to evolving health conditions and government requirements, AU will offer fall semester undergraduate and graduate courses online with no residential experience. We will be updating the FAQ and providing additional details going forward &lt;a href="https://t.co/yV1pPh7cFR"&gt;https://t.co/yV1pPh7cFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— American University (@AmericanU) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanU/status/1288854926500728833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XEK7o"&gt;DiNardo walks to campus about once a week for a change of scene. Sometimes, she studies on the quad or in one of the few buildings that are open, as far away from other people as possible. Occasionally, she meets up with other students in her classes, and they watch their Zoom lectures together. “We can feel like we’re in the classroom,” she says. Plus, “It keeps me from dozing off and going on my phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBdPRi"&gt;But walking around an empty campus can also be eerie — it’s a reminder of what’s been taken away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iTXOP6"&gt;DiNardo is one of hundreds of thousands of US students who were tasked with cobbling together a college experience from their bedrooms this year. American, like &lt;a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/heres-a-list-of-colleges-plans-for-reopening-in-the-fall/#id=193973"&gt;almost half&lt;/a&gt; of colleges across the US, taught all courses primarily or fully online. Students took classes, did homework, met with clubs, applied for internships. Many, like DiNardo, even lived by campus, down the hallway from their classmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHsWsr"&gt;On paper, that semester looks fairly similar to pre-COVID life. And since the first wave of closures in March, onlookers have wondered: if school can happen online, why have campuses at all? Writers decreed that COVID-19 was the &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviergarret/2020/06/04/this-is-the-end-of-college-as-we-know-it/?sh=1efa6154297c"&gt;end of college as we know it&lt;/a&gt;. A former college president &lt;a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-should-colleges-prepare-for-a-post-pandemic-world/?cid=gen_sign_in"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that the online semester would push students to switch to lower-cost online degree programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zkLUGf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;While we hoped to come back to campus together next month, we have made the difficult decision to hold all undergraduate courses online for the fall semester, with limited exceptions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1/4)&lt;a href="https://t.co/uedKAbNmq6"&gt;https://t.co/uedKAbNmq6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— GW University (@GWtweets) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GWtweets/status/1287837153796464641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YzepU1"&gt;But the virtual fall neglected one important component of the college experience: mental health. For the seven students, faculty, staff, and administrators that I spoke to, this semester brought to light how important an in-person community is to many students’ well-being — and how difficult that is to replicate over Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31swXC"&gt;DiNardo started out the fall semester optimistic — she hadn’t minded a few weeks of online classes in the spring. But after spending day after day indoors, in front of computers, she could tell that her friends weren’t doing well. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Everyone’s becoming a ball of stress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9my3Gh"&gt;Then her own behavior started to change. She was taking longer to get out of bed. She wanted to sleep all the time. She was wearing darker clothing. Toward the end of the semester, she was on the phone with her doctor, trying to schedule an appointment, and suddenly burst into tears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sElio"&gt;DiNardo and her friends aren’t alone. Jay Gilmore, an assistant professor of journalism and strategic media at the University of Memphis, tried his best to keep his pupils meeting (over Zoom) regularly, with assignments on a routine schedule, to make this semester “as normal as possible.” But as classes went on, he saw his students lose motivation — grades slipped. “If a class started at 9:40, I would see students rolling over in bed at 9:39,” Gilmore said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lkv1mo"&gt;Gilmore doesn’t think the sluggishness has anything to do with his instruction. He says his students are lonely, and the isolation is taking a toll on their mental health. Research backs him up: in a &lt;a href="https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e21279/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of US college students published in September, 71 percent of respondents reported increased stress and anxiety due to COVID-19. Of those, 86 percent cited decreased social interaction as a factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scXGDC"&gt;“It’s such an important time for young adults to feel a sense of community, and their main developmental task is to be establishing their identity with their peers,” said Michael Alcee, mental health coordinator at the Manhattan School of Music. “Having that short-circuited by this pandemic is particularly difficult, psychologically and emotionally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xPXjF1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a class started at 9:40, I would see students rolling over in bed at 9:39”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PK0eVZ"&gt;It’s certainly possible to socialize online. But it’s different — and, students told me, less fulfilling — in a couple significant ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsdp1m"&gt;For one, when you’re spending a full day on Zoom, socializing on Zoom doesn’t always feel like a break — it feels like yet another thing you have to do on Zoom. Emma Marszalek, a junior at George Washington University who spent the semester at home in New Jersey, hasn’t attended the movie screenings, trivia nights, guest performances, and other virtual events that her school has put on. “As cute as it is... I can’t bring myself to go onto another Zoom meeting,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCwgBo"&gt;There’s also the lack of spontaneity — chatting over Zoom requires setting aside time, which is already in short supply for many students. Grabbing a quick coffee on the way to class or running into an acquaintance in the library is off the table. “At school, I could see someone, and even if we talk for five minutes walking from one place to another, it fits better into your schedule,” Marszalek says. “Now, if I want to talk to someone I have to text them, which is effort, and then schedule a time when we FaceTime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybGyOr"&gt;And meeting new people, while still possible during a virtual semester, can be a daunting prospect. Allen Kenneth Schaidle, a PhD student in higher education and organizational change at UCLA, says his university has encouraged students to reach out virtually and connect with others in their classes — but he thinks that’s too much onus to put on them. “We’ve seen that message coming from these offices that ‘We’re doing the best we can, but it’s also up to you to start reaching out to people,’” he says. “We should also fill these gap times where students might be having organic social interactions on campus... and I’m not seeing that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Neko"&gt;These may seem like simple enough things. But they’re aspects of college social life that many students and university members took for granted in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2FlZg"&gt;“People re-evaluated what’s really important,” says Alcee. Alcee held counseling sessions over Zoom this semester — as well as by phone, for students who were tired of Zoom. He says he’s worked with introverted students who were initially excited not to have to socialize but started missing it. He also worked with social students who, until this year, hadn’t realized just how necessary their social circle was to them. For both groups, video calls didn’t cut it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJJ0c9"&gt;Gilmore hosts a &lt;a href="https://jays-world.captivate.fm/episodes"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; where he speaks to students and educators around the country — and he’s talked to very few who are happy. Many of them underestimated how lonely pandemic college would feel. “Just being in the university center with other students ... getting together for a football game at the stadium, I think we all had taken that for granted in recent years,” said Gilmore. “And 2020 has shown people want to get back to that, they want to get back to human interaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mGzYo4"&gt;Every student and educator I spoke to is aware of the seriousness of COVID-19. None of them questioned the importance of taking precautions or the necessity (in some regions) of moving classes online. But students did say that when they return to campus, they’ll be investing a lot more in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmOSqe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can’t keep budgeting every minute of my time to schoolwork”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O1SghR"&gt;“There will be a greater level of appreciation for the smaller things,” said Schaidle. “Being in class, getting to know your peers, walking around on campus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CA5qh3"&gt;Marszalek decided to drop one of her two majors so that she can spend more time socializing whenever she returns to George Washington. This semester brought “this realization that I can’t keep budgeting every minute of my time to schoolwork or classwork, because ... I want to be able to actually see people and do fun things,” she says. “I can just experience being with my friends, going on adventures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHkKRc"&gt;“I want to take advantage of that stuff,” she added. “Because it’s not always available.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We built a 2020 time capsule out of synthetic DNA — here’s how</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A gloved hand holds a small vial; illustrated DNA swirls around it" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ht3VGxEZZajwY9dsRU9swnx1Efg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68560013/Container_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i5iaWI"&gt;Somehow, it’s the end of December. What is there to say about 2020? This year has felt like a turning point, a cliff, the end of one world and the beginning of another. For us on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s science desk (and so many others), it’s been a year we want to both lock away forever and also never forget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuGLpn"&gt;As 2020 wound down, we decided that we wanted to commemorate this unreal year with a time capsule, so that whatever happens in 2021 and beyond, there will be a small, resilient snippet of 2020 that future historians, scientists, or space aliens can unearth and wonder about. So we took a whack at distilling a year’s worth of science memories into a handful of digital files. It’s far from comprehensive, but it tells some intriguing stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EIzRD"&gt;The first part of the project was compiling the time capsule assets themselves. We built a file browser &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938039"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you can click through the digital moments and ephemera we included and think about what our descendants might make of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POD2k7"&gt;The second challenge was figuring out how to preserve the files themselves for hundreds or even thousands of years. Most modern storage media — like hard drives or flash memory — is built to be cheap, not durable. But there’s one up-and-coming storage medium that could keep our files safe for millennia: synthetic DNA. Over the past few weeks, we worked with a team of scientists and engineers to encode our digital mementos into custom strands of DNA. The result has to be seen to be believed... even if it’s technically too small to actually see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Epvdpx"&gt;Check out the video above for the whole story, and here’s to a brand-new 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lupin III: The First is the perfect holiday adventure</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A6eIg8"&gt;It is shockingly hard to find a new movie that’s interested in an old-fashioned &lt;em&gt;adventure. &lt;/em&gt;You know what I mean: the globe-trotting &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt; kind, with riddles to solve and death traps to avoid, featuring a hint of romance and a strange treasure at stake. Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Lupin III&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The First&lt;/em&gt; is exactly that. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki and streaming on-demand, the film is a gorgeously animated romp around the world starring an iconic manga character. Also, some Nazis get their asses handed to them.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mslBFh"&gt;Depending on how familiar you are with the manga, &lt;em&gt;The First&lt;/em&gt; is either a triumphant return or modern introduction to Arsène Lupin III, one of manga and anime’s most storied characters. Created by artist and writer Monkey Punch in 1967, Lupin is a “gentleman thief” and a descendant of French novelist Maurice Leblanc’s famous Arsène Lupin character. The character has starred in many shows, movies, and manga since his debut; he’s James Bond with a wacky sense of humor and a looser moral code. (The older stories haven’t aged well.) Most people, however, will be familiar with Lupin as he appears in 1979’s &lt;em&gt;The Castle of Cagliostro&lt;/em&gt;, the first film directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki’s film portrays Lupin in a more slapstick and ultimately gallant light than in some of the source material, and this is the version of Lupin that we meet in &lt;em&gt;The First&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ilgkB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The First &lt;/em&gt;begins in 1960s France as the celebrated thief announces his intent to steal a newly unearthed treasure: the Bresson Diary, a World War II-era journal with a terrible secret locked away in a puzzle box. This initial heist goes awry when Lupin learns there is someone else after the diary: Laetitia, a reluctant thief who, unbeknownst to her, is a descendant of the diary’s author. Together, the two embark on an adventure to solve the mystery hidden within the diary and stay one step ahead of a third interested party, the aforementioned Nazis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBReHf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lupin III: The First&lt;/em&gt; puts its foot on the gas at minute one and never lets up. It’s like &lt;em&gt;Looney Tunes&lt;/em&gt; by way of &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Eleven&lt;/em&gt;. And unlike many recent attempts to update classic anime to CGI — like the strange and unpleasant &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Lupin III: The First &lt;/em&gt;makes the leap to computer animation with its sense of style and dynamism intact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMnZfU"&gt;While computer animation can’t impress the same way an intricate hand-drawn sequence can (like &lt;em&gt;The Castle of Cagliostro&lt;/em&gt;’s signature clocktower fight), &lt;em&gt;The First&lt;/em&gt; lovingly recreates the cartoon physical comedy and stylish pulp thrills of previous iterations. There are multiple scenes — like one where Lupin must navigate an elaborate death trap after only seeing it go off once — that will leave you grinning as Yuji Ohno’s score kicks into high gear and the balletic buffoonery begins. (At times, it recalls 2011’s dynamic &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&lt;/em&gt;, a movie that, tragically, has not produced a sequel.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWIKpA"&gt;The film is so top-to-bottom &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; that it’s hard to fault it much, even when it takes some truly outrageous turns in its final act that may give you pause before you remember how much of a good time you’re having. Movies like &lt;em&gt;Lupin III: The First&lt;/em&gt; don’t come along very often. And when they do, it makes you wonder why it’s been so long since you’ve seen one. After all, who doesn’t like getting swept up in a grand adventure?&lt;/p&gt;
