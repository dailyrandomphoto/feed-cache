    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s first big patch is out now, and it’s packed with bug fixes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ommx--Sa6-R-jRv0yU9QsStnF9o=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68708144/screen_image_about_768457e5.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MjYBzD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s first big update is available now, and it’s packed with bug fixes for the notoriously buggy game. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1352743220481024001"&gt;In a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, developer CD Projekt Red also said that the update “lays the groundwork” for future patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UT04ox"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Patch 1.1 is out on PC, consoles and Stadia!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this update, which lays the groundwork for the upcoming patches, we focused on various stability improvements and bugfixes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;List of changes: &lt;a href="https://t.co/NlSEKjsax7"&gt;https://t.co/NlSEKjsax7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/WjLcD0SaZk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WjLcD0SaZk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1352743220481024001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gbEX21"&gt;The 1.1 patch arrives more than a month after &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; rocky launch. The game has been plagued with bugs and issues, particularly on older consoles, though CD Projekt Red has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; to try to shore up some of the problems. Sony yanked the game from the PlayStation Store and began offering full refunds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;, but the game still hasn’t returned to the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mK8dZI"&gt;CD Projekt Red has &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;already announced&lt;/a&gt; another major patch would follow this one, and the studio described it as a “larger, more significant update” that will arrive “in the weeks after” patch 1.1. The studio is also aiming to release a free update to optimize the game for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop stock halts trading after Reddit drama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GameStop stock halted trading briefly Friday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ei7Bwsl5c8qXp_nAkCeRY6phK60=/0x0:3594x2396/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68707894/1227730798.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FqXEIW"&gt;Trading in stock of video game retailer GameStop (GME) was halted briefly Friday, as it soared more than 70 percent, due partly to the enthusiastic support of a group of Reddit day traders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISIbpr"&gt;The stock is up more than 250 percent year to date, rising sharply last week after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574?mod=article_inline"&gt;GameStop announced Chewy CEO Ryan Cohen&lt;/a&gt; was joining its board, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/gamestop-soars-nearly-70percent-trading-briefly-halted-amid-epic-short-squeeze.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. Short-seller Citron Research predicted the price would drop, but members of the Reddit board r/wallstreetbets, who had been generating interest in the stock, criticized Citron on the Reddit message board and continued praising the stock on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFP7uu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GameStop is the most-shorted stock in the market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oetvu"&gt;The hype generated by r/wallstreetbets helped create what’s known as a “short squeeze” on GameStop’s stock. A short squeeze works like this: some investors, known as shorts, essentially bet that a company’s stock will fall. These investors borrow stock from other investors and sell it — with plans to buy it back when the prices fall and then return it to the original owner. However, the problem with shorting is that one’s losses are theoretically infinite; if a stock begins an upward run, some short sellers will abandon their short and buy shares at the higher price to return. This, in turn, makes the stock go higher, burning any other shorts who remain in the stock, some of whom may, in turn, choose to cover their own shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9Gl4Y"&gt;GameStop is the most-shorted stock in the market, CNBC said, citing FactSet. More than 138 percent of its shares are sold short — making it a prime target for a short squeeze. GameStop’s Reddit-related surge triggered a circuit breaker stoppage when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1352672994607378439"&gt;it rose 69 percent (nice)&lt;/a&gt; on Friday around 12:45PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwUBF3"&gt;Citron said Friday it would no longer comment on the GameStop stock because of “the angry mob who owns this stock.” Citron Research editor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CitronResearch2/status/1352627162508005376?s=20"&gt;Andrew Left wrote in a note to readers&lt;/a&gt; that the backlash had included criminal activity he planned to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which included harassment of minor children as well as financial crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUVvd4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/gamestop-tug-of-war-gives-reddit-army-a-win-on-record-volatility?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the past 10 days has been the most volatile period in GameStop’s stock in its history. At the close of markets Friday, GSE was up more than 50 percent from its Thursday close, with a market cap of $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTt2WY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US Defense Intelligence Agency admits to buying citizens’ location data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qHFkSvkbuXTeOzWXC5TwwCapuh8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68707859/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lr5MnL"&gt;An intelligence agency has just confirmed that the US government does indeed buy location data collected by its citizens’ smartphones. In a memo sent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917988/ron-wyden-facebook-privacy-data-regulation-do-not-track"&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/dia-surveillance-data.html"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) admitted that it buys location data from brokers — and that the data isn’t separated by whether a person lives in the US or outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGhCxg"&gt;Data brokers are companies that, as the name implies, collect and sell people’s information. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303190/congress-data-smartphone-tracking-fbi-security-privacy"&gt;collect people’s location information (and much more)&lt;/a&gt; by paying app makers and websites for it. Once the broker has the information, they can aggregate it and sell it to whoever’s willing to pay for it — including the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHyYzA"&gt;In the memo, the DIA says that its “personnel can only query the US location database when authorized through a specific process” that requires approval from senior leadership, the Office of Oversight and Compliance, and the Office of General Counsel. The DIA also says that in the past two and a half years, it’s been given permission to look through US device location data five times. You can read &lt;a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/dia-memo-for-wyden-on-commercially-available-smartphone-locational-data/d7d41dccdd1d46b0/full.pdf"&gt;the full memo&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dfV6Oy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here's the defense intelligence agency memo confirming that the government is buying commercially available smartphone location data w/o a warrant &lt;a href="https://t.co/DXGH24PRph"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DXGH24PRph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— chris mills rodrigo (@chrisismills) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1352684462795067393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j0w4Cl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DIA claims it can legally collect the data, as long as it doesn’t look at it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X6qslI"&gt;The Fourth Amendment requires government agencies to get a warrant before they can compel data from a third party like a phone company — a rule most recently upheld by the Supreme Court’s Carpenter decision. But the DIA argues that the ruling doesn’t apply to getting that same data from brokers because the agency isn’t invoking the power of law. In the memo it states that the agency “does not construe the Carpenter decision to require a judicial warrant endorsing purchase or use of commercially available data for intelligence purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlFz7Z"&gt;The American Civil Liberties Union disagrees. In a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, senior staff attorney Ashley Gorski said that “the government cannot simply buy our private data in order to bypass bedrock constitutional protections,” and called on Congress to “end this lawless practice and require the government to get a warrant for our location data, regardless of its source.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2XVkl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169905/google-apple-removing-location-tracking-data-sale-government-advertisers"&gt;We’ve been aware for a while&lt;/a&gt; that government agencies have been using data brokerages to get around having to obtain a warrant for location information, but some legislators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354244/ron-wyden-fcc-nomination-section-230-trump-order-vergecast-interview"&gt;are working to close the loophole&lt;/a&gt;. Sen. Wyden, who requested the memo be made, has a bill called “The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale,” which aims to “ban the government from buying information that would otherwise require a court order or a warrant.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake studio will now focus exclusively on Blizzard games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iVpcMHQvb1d7PEm_tTJq0hzMmns=/82x0:972x593/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68707635/Tony_Hawk_ProSkater_ANishimura.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UPjGp9"&gt;Vicarious Visions, the studio that developed &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; and the remake for &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2,&lt;/em&gt; has been reassigned within Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-01-22-vicarious-visions-merged-into-blizzard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Moving forward, the studio’s team of about 200 people will now be “fully dedicated to existing Blizzard games and initiatives.” That means for any games Vicarious Visions works on in the future, it will not serve as the lead development studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuOL2b"&gt;“After collaborating with Vicarious Visions for some time and developing a great relationship, Blizzard realized there was an opportunity for [Vicarious Visions] to provide long-term support,” a Blizzard spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;. The studio did not specify what projects Vicarious Visions is providing support for currently, as Blizzard Entertainment is currently working on three titles — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18056370/diablo-immortal-mobile-blizzard-blizzcon-2018"&gt;an ARPG hack and slash mobile game, &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to sequels for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943766/blizzard-overwatch-2-sequel-announcement-blizzcon-2019"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JorMM9"&gt;As part of the merger, Jen Oneal, who previously served as the studio’s head, has been promoted as the executive vice president of development at Blizzard. Vicarious Visions was founded in 1990 and became a subsidiary of Activision in 2005. Throughout its 30-plus year lifespan, the studio has worked on various projects across numerous franchises, including &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about COVID-19 vaccine fights on Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsUPSMmZCpOfmYXtBOIXay7TsMw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68707559/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vja78H"&gt;Adequate COVID-19 vaccine distribution still seems like the greatest obstacle to slowing the spread of the pandemic, but if you’re looking to worry about the other threat that’s still blocking progress — an unwillingness to take the vaccine at all — and the creative efforts on Facebook that are going into stopping it, &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fights-over-the-covid-19-vaccine-are-everywhere-on-facebook/"&gt;you should go read this &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7coZH"&gt;Facebook’s taken steps to combat misinformation related to the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing false claims about COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514535/facebook-anti-vaxx-ad-ban-moderation-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;banning ads that discourage vaccine use&lt;/a&gt;, but reporter Kaleigh Rogers highlights some of the more direct outreach that pro-vaccine activists are doing to combat misinformation. From “honeypot” Facebook groups designed to capture the anti-vax curious to direct outreach from groups like C.I.C.A.D.A. (Community Immunity Champions and Defenders Association) flooding comments with positive vaccine information, there’s a daily struggle to change minds (and dunk on the misinformed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0S7e5c"&gt;The larger problem remains, though: Facebook’s advertising-based business can often incentivize emotional reactions to posts that drive people into the arms of the anti-vax movement. COVID-19’s popularity as a topic of discussion on Facebook has made it even easier for anti-vaxxers to reuse false narratives about the “dangers” of vaccines to quickly bring people into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y4BTe"&gt;Until Facebook comes up with a new way to combat misinformation or changes how its algorithm chooses to surface posts, this kind of work will remain important. Rogers summarizes those efforts well, along with the obvious problem of Facebook’s core design. You can &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fights-over-the-covid-19-vaccine-are-everywhere-on-facebook/"&gt;read the whole article on &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An EU parliament website for COVID testing allegedly broke the EU’s privacy laws</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kNSA0iY514tOFQcWIPiKlftAPWU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706922/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NxqwGd"&gt;The European Parliament is being investigated by the European Data Protection Supervisor &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/privacy-complaint-targets-european-parliaments-covid-19-test-booking-site/"&gt;after allegations that its COVID testing website didn’t meet EU privacy standards&lt;/a&gt;. Six members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/data-transfers-us-and-insufficient-cookie-information-noyb-files-complaint-behalf-six-meps-against"&gt;worked with data watchdog group noyb&lt;/a&gt; to bring the complaint, saying that the site illegally sent data to the US and that its cookie banners were deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tssvAN"&gt;The website was set up to help MEPs schedule COVID tests, and while it didn’t handle any health information itself, sending data to the US for processing would still be illegal. &lt;a href="https://noyb.eu/en/data-transfers-us-and-insufficient-cookie-information-noyb-files-complaint-behalf-six-meps-against"&gt;According to the complaint&lt;/a&gt;, the testing website made over 150 requests to third parties, including Google and Stripe. Under EU law, data can only be transferred to the US if “an adequate level of protection for the personal data [can] be ensured,” and noyb argues that the companies “clearly fall under relevant US surveillance laws that allow [targeting of] EU citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6o3XMA"&gt;The complaint also alleges that the cookie banners on the site didn’t disclose all of the cookies that would be stored on the user’s computer, and that the banners prodded users toward the “Accept All” button. Since cookies are used to track users across websites, and some of the ones found were from the aforementioned US companies, it’s understandable that EU regulators might be caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAat7Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-privacy-idUSKBN29R1EB"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the European Data Protection Supervisor started investigating the site back in October, following other complaints from MEPs. A spokesperson said that the information from noyb was “of direct relevance to this complaint [and would] be examined thoroughly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gbIva"&gt;EU privacy laws can sometimes be hard for web developers to grasp, but most web developers aren’t under direction of the lawmakers themselves. Creation of the site was contracted out to a third-party company, but you’d hope that there was a specification for “follows all EU privacy laws” included in the brief.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55vS2b"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, noyb’s chairman Max Schrems said EU institutions like the parliament “have to lead by example,” and it seems that, in this instance, they haven’t lived up to that responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tries to delay warehouse union vote in Alabama</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mYv6nkC3jLeugvj2DcCyxMJfpSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706680/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9njjC"&gt;Amazon is trying to delay a union vote in Bessemer, Alabama, appealing a US labor board decision to allow 6,000 warehouse workers to vote by mail on unionization. The company is arguing for the election to be held in person, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/10-RC-269250"&gt;documents filed with the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt; (NLRB) Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSs6K2"&gt;Amazon’s argument is that mail-in voting decreases voter turnout. It says the NLRB looked at the wrong COVID-19 infection data when determining how to hold the vote, using the positivity rate in Jefferson County, where the warehouse is located, rather than the positivity rate at the warehouse itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nwLBS"&gt;Workers in Bessemer are set to vote on whether to unionize with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union starting on February 8th. Ballots must be mailed in by March 29th, and the vote count should take place on March 30th. It will be the tech giant’s first union election in the US since 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-labor/amazon-seeks-to-halt-union-election-at-alabama-warehouse-idUSKBN29R23P"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiL2yC"&gt;In December, the National Labor Relations Board &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/02/amazon-union-vote-hearing/"&gt;rejected an earlier attempt by the tech giant to delay a hearing on the union effort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQGcRi"&gt;In a filing on January 21st, Amazon said if the acting regional director had looked at more recent COVID-19 data, she would have seen the county infection rate was decreasing. “If a manual election is improper here, it is hard to imagine any circumstances in which a Regional Director would allow manual elections until COVID-19 is eradicated,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otYPHh"&gt;The NLRB had previously reported the Jefferson County infection rate was over 17 percent in early January, and noted that new cases were rising. Now, Amazon is arguing that not only was this data wrong, but the NLRB should be using data from its warehouse instead. The positivity rate there, according to Amazon, is far lower. “Frankly, it defies belief that, when three medical experts essentially agree that the conditions at [the warehouse] are safer than in another geographic area, a reasonable fact finder would ignore that consensus to concentrate on that other geographic area in making a safety-related determination,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpEMYv"&gt;The NLRB could become even less favorable to Amazon with the election of Joe Biden, who has already made aggressive moves to shift the board’s stance toward unions. On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-quickly-moves-to-force-out-peter-robb-trumps-labor-board-attorney_n_6008adc1c5b697df1a0bb88e"&gt;President Biden fired Peter Robb&lt;/a&gt;, general counsel of the NLRB and a longtime opponent of labor groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="MNo1Tb"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google search on mobile is getting a redesign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOqV751QsMg5zZ_cRzREpq8CnEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706649/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sF9PFg"&gt;Google is redesigning how search results look on mobile, the company announced &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/mobile-redesign-2021"&gt;in a blog on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. “We wanted to take a step back to simplify a bit so people could find what they’re looking for faster and more easily,” Aileen Cheng, who led the redesign, said in the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWJgjX"&gt;The redesign will have larger and bolder text that’s intended to be easier to scan quickly, and you’ll see more of Google’s font in results. Search results will also take up more of the width of your screen, thanks in part to reduced shadows. Google also says the redesign will use color “more intentionally” to help highlight important information without being distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TB0O87"&gt;To get an idea of how the redesign differs from the current experience, compare this render of the redesign with a screenshot of the current search experience I took from my iPhone 12 mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgy90U6pgXZbA3DiBn7rPHMJyrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253128/OSRP_NEW.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUoY1cfOnZDauik-Hu3Bx-yTAfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253126/IMG_0168.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2YBvC8"&gt;It looks like the new design puts more information higher up the page and reduces some visual clutter, which will hopefully make results easier to parse without forcing you to scroll down too far to find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7S1wM"&gt;Google says the redesign will roll out in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC fines three ticket scalping companies for illegally using bots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elton John Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour - Auckland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7VN7ih4D6MZiyhqaug2XlaIRgY=/0x0:2999x1999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706536/1206593986.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gOt24P"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission issued multimillion-dollar fines against three bot-powered ticket scalping operations. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/ftc-brings-first-ever-cases-under-bots-act"&gt;The FTC says&lt;/a&gt; these organizations bought over 150,000 event tickets over the past four years, nabbing them with automated tools that evaded online purchasing limits. After reselling these tickets for an estimated $26.1 million, they’ve been accused of breaking a 2016 anti-bot law — the first time this law has been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baQqWd"&gt;Regulators reached a proposed settlement with the ticket selling groups, including $31.6 million in fines. However, most of these fines were suspended because of an inability to pay. The three groups will pay a total of $3.7 million instead, and they’ll have to maintain records demonstrating their future compliance with the law. The settlement must still be approved by a judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzmBiE"&gt;The Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act bans using software to circumvent ticket purchase limits — a practice that lets resellers buy tickets in bulk and resell them at a steep markup. “Not only does this deprive loyal fans of the chance to see their favorite performers and shows, it is against the law,” said FTC consumer protection bureau director Andrew Smith in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFPXKi"&gt;While the complaints don’t specify which shows the scalpers were targeting, they note that the list includes many sporting events and other performances, including Elton John concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft risks a year of goodwill with its Xbox Live price hike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h5BJ17yE9XMSgU9_kfoRkSTBTWg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68706389/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JmJrxe"&gt;Microsoft spent most of 2020 building up goodwill for its Xbox Game Pass service and next-gen consoles, but a new Xbox Live Gold price hike risks wiping all of that out. The Xbox maker announced a number of changes to Xbox Live Gold pricing today — you should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244173/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-increase-pricing"&gt;read our full post for details&lt;/a&gt; — and the bottom line is that it’s moving from $60 a year to $120 for most people. That’s a huge jump and a badly timed one: it’s happening in the middle of a pandemic, just as Microsoft has reported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537015/microsoft-q1-2021-earnings-revenue-cloud-services-surface-gaming-xbox"&gt;big boosts&lt;/a&gt; to its gaming revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales"&gt;throughout 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnHvWO"&gt;The reason for the move is obvious — get people on Xbox Game Pass — but Microsoft has done it in a clumsy and poorly timed way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORfkf9"&gt;Xbox fans are understandably angry. Microsoft stands alone in being the only major platform holder to force players of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, and other popular free-to-play games to pay a subscription fee for access to multiplayer. That fee has now doubled annually for most Xbox players, as the majority of people buy codes to top up their Xbox Live subscription. Microsoft quietly removed these $59.99 12-month codes last year, and the six-month codes are now priced at $59.99. You can probably still find 12-month codes from resellers and retailers, but they’re officially discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eDpf8O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10297752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FgxXHK"&gt;That means many &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players will now have to pay $120 a year just to play on an Xbox console. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch is free, and even on Microsoft’s own Windows platform, it’s free to play. In fact, PC gamers playing Xbox Live-enabled games don’t even have to pay for Xbox Live Gold to access multiplayer. It’s a bizarre situation for Microsoft to knowingly place itself into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrYd5K"&gt;Microsoft’s announcement doesn’t even attempt to justify this price hike. In a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/01/22/update-on-xbox-live-gold-pricing/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that reads like it was written by a lawyer, Microsoft says “periodically, we assess the value and pricing of our services to reflect changes in regional marketplaces and to continue to invest in the Xbox community,” before announcing the changes. The only justification is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EMzwsS"&gt;We invest in our community by strengthening the digital safety of our players, enabling new ways to share, communicate and play with your friends, and delivering industry leading reliability across our network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LhjwIS"&gt;What Microsoft’s announcement doesn’t detail is the real reason for these price changes: Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft quickly managed to entice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242004/xbox-game-pass-10-million-subscribers-microsoft-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;10 million people onto Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; last year, with $1 deals and more. That figure soon jumped 50 percent to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth"&gt;15 million in September&lt;/a&gt;, making Xbox Game Pass look like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242479/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscribers-phil-spencer-comments"&gt;very clever bet for Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GU2sZa"&gt;Xbox Game Pass has been praised widely, but Microsoft is now clearly trying to aggressively move its existing Xbox Live Gold player base over to the service. Microsoft is allowing Xbox Live Gold subscribers to switch to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (usually $14.99 per month) and convert the amount of time in months or years into Ultimate subscriptions. That’s a good initial deal for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, but the end goal is clearly for Microsoft to earn more revenue per Xbox user in the future once they’re hooked to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and everything it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="xcloud" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l9NsQMpMNCES4feF5DNZZSX5DH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21950537/vpavic_xcloud_20201009_0011_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes xCloud streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5YTyLM"&gt;This move may also allow Microsoft to keep pushing Xbox Game Pass throughout 2021 without having to increase its pricing. Microsoft has so far resisted an Xbox Game Pass price increase, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429922/xbox-game-pass-for-pc-price-increase-september-17"&gt;except for the introductory pricing&lt;/a&gt; for its PC subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q726YO"&gt;I’ve argued before that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen console&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;acquisition of Bethesda for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; reinforced that late last year. Microsoft has some big plans for Xbox Game Pass for 2021 and beyond, but it’s clearly keen to move its legacy Xbox Live subscribers over to the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvfip9"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is a killer deal with access to more than 100 games, xCloud game streaming, and Xbox Live Gold for $14.99 per month. Microsoft has just tackled this migration abruptly and with terrible timing and messaging. Many are still considering whether to buy an Xbox or a PS5, as both consoles are still sold out. The blow of an Xbox Live Gold price increase could have been softened for new and existing Xbox owners with the removal of the need for Xbox Live Gold for free-to-play multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmZnBx"&gt;That’s something that Microsoft should consider, particularly as the company has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer will be free to play&lt;/a&gt; when it launches later this year. If this Xbox Live Gold requirement still stands, it puts &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; in the awkward position of being free to play on PC but needing a $10.99 monthly subscription on Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve8hLq"&gt;All of this leaves Microsoft in the odd position of now offering one of the best deals in gaming (Xbox Game Pass) and now one of the worst (Xbox Live Gold). For those not interested in Xbox Game Pass, it’s a bitter pill to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
