    <title>Halo Infinite won’t let you pick levels to replay — but that’s going to change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7sS1Xqc1s8hK-SHi7OuO85NM11w=/1x0:1455x969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237828/ss_139cc855c27fe902e58ba8e7af0aad1aee6ac876.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief and The Weapon in &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhdtbM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign launches on Wednesday, but after your first trip through the story, you won’t be able to replay missions without starting all the way over, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22820921/halo-infinite-story-mission-replayability"&gt;Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a significant omission, since it means you won’t be able to get collectibles you miss the first time around. It also means &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is the first &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game without a way to go back and easily replay a chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTmARu"&gt;That might not always be the case, though, as developer 343 Industries wants to add the feature down the line, the studio told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We haven’t announced a date but that is being worked on,” 343 Industries associate creative director Paul Crocker said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIxOlS"&gt;“We want to have replay that works well, and when you have a more open game, it gets a lot trickier,” he said. “So we made a decision to improve the quality of the single-player campaign to ensure that, as a foundation, that it’s as strong as it possibly could be so that we could then add the other features back in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYTsGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some elements do carry over between full campaign replays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XB8Wtz"&gt;It’s frustrating not to be able to play through missions again; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; has some impressive set pieces and great boss fights that I’d love to tackle without going through the entire story another time. However, there are some elements that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; carry over between full campaign replays, according to Crocker, including data pads (which contain story-focused voice logs) and the hard-to-find skulls that, in past games, let you modify certain aspects of the experience (such as doubling enemy health). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rf7wuZ"&gt;Replayable story missions aren’t the only thing that was pushed back for the launch; you’re going to have to wait &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;at least six months&lt;/a&gt; for the time-honored tradition of playing through the campaign cooperatively with a friend, something you’ve been able to do since the very first &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game. The goal was “from day one” to make the game playable in co-op and allow people to replay missions, but “we just had to prioritize what we could get done in time,” Crocker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXiwuD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; has had a somewhat rocky development. It was originally set to release alongside the Xbox Series X / S in November 2020, but was delayed to 2021 after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;gameplay reveal&lt;/a&gt; that birthed the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/craig-from-halo-infinite-is-the-new-xbox-mascot-jokes-xbox-chief"&gt;Craig meme&lt;/a&gt;. Forge mode, which was introduced in &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; and lets players develop multiplayer maps and games, is also missing for &lt;em&gt;Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; launch. And while 343 Industries launched &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;free-to-play multiplayer beta early&lt;/a&gt;, it has had to address criticisms of the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788990/halo-infinite-battle-pass-progression-xp-changes"&gt;progression system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;lack of dedicated playlists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBLlyw"&gt;Despite those problems, the extra development time paid off for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign and multiplayer, which are both pretty good. That bodes well for the features that won’t make it at launch — even if we don’t know how long we’ll have to wait for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s media company has a new CEO: soon-to-be-former-Rep. Devin Nunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Republican Conference at Capitol Hill Club" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Chf4WF3nwwK3IRviti9ape-bQgU=/0x0:6525x4350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237802/1237059264.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., leaves a meeting of the House Republican Conference at the Capitol Hill Club on Wednesday, December 1, 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l7o5tn"&gt;A filing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820389/sec-trump-spac-deal-investigation-truth-social-media-platform-public"&gt;just revealed an SEC investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the plans for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) named Digital World Acquisition Corp. to merge with Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group (TMTG) and start trading on the Nasdaq, so what’s next for the would-be social media/regular media giant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pg3Wiw"&gt;Naturally, TMTG has &lt;a href="https://ir.tmtgcorp.com/news-events/press-releases/"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; a splashy new hire as its CEO, recruiting Congressman Devin G. Nunes. A supporter, and defender of Trump, Nunes served on the House Intelligence Committee as it investigated allegations Russia helped the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. Yes, that’s also “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18271805/devin-nunes-twitter-lawsuit-250-million-liz-mair-defamation'"&gt;I sued Twitter for letting Devin Nunes’ Mom and Devin Nunes’ Cow insult me&lt;/a&gt;” Devin G. Nunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVAG7q"&gt;The congressman plans to leave the US House of Representatives — where redistricting &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/national-politics/article/Devin-Nunes-redistricting-Fresno-Tulare-2022-map-16613177.php"&gt;may have made his current seat tough to hold on to&lt;/a&gt; — and take on the new role in January. In a statement, the man named in a lawsuit claiming &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devincow"&gt;this cow account&lt;/a&gt; caused him “extreme pain and suffering” says, “The time has come to reopen the Internet and allow for the free flow of ideas and expression without censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YSaGD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Truth Social recently admitted it uses open source technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zHtDsu"&gt;As CEO of TMTG, he would be in charge of the upcoming social media platform Truth Social, hoping to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;Parag Agrawal&lt;/a&gt; of Twitter (both platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;banned the former president&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol). Nunes will also run streaming platform TMTG Plus, which the company says is a subscription-based video service full of “non-woke entertainment, news, documentaries, podcasts and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVWrqm"&gt;According to TMTG chairman Donald Trump, “Congressman Devin Nunes is a fighter and a leader. He will make an excellent CEO of TMTG. Devin understands that we must stop the liberal media and Big Tech from destroying the freedoms that make America great. America is ready for TRUTH Social and the end to censorship and political discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SSlpy"&gt;In October, Truth Social was cited by Mastodon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752850/mastodon-trump-truth-social-network-open-source-gab-legal-notice"&gt;for reusing the project’s open source code without including the required notifications&lt;/a&gt; and publishing whatever tweaks it made so that the community could benefit. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/trumps-social-media-site-quietly-admits-its-based-on-mastodon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that Truth Social has &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/open-source/"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; its open-source roots and posted some code. However, the package available doesn’t appear to include any of the “proprietary” code operators said the site will use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyU7El"&gt;While announcing the merger between DWAC and TMTG, the companies indicated Truth Social would have a “Beta Launch for invited guests” in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says the US should ‘get rid of all’ government subsidies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/il0mX3UUytsVhTMaP8XI_n2tP4c=/0x254:3926x2871/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237784/1234657391.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wACrKi"&gt;Elon Musk said Monday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSD_vpfikbE"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; CEO summit&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t think the United States needs the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill — or any government subsidies, for that matter. “Just delete them all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgEys2"&gt;The Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the interview that he’s concerned about the federal deficit. “We’ve spent so much money.. the federal budget deficit is insane,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euYUQ1"&gt;“I would say... can the whole bill. Don’t pass it, that’s my recommendation,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpeAG"&gt;Musk pointed out that Tesla has been selling its electric cars for more than a year in the US without the $7,500 federal tax credit, without taking a demand hit. Most other automakers, save for General Motors, are still eligible for the credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uu9GAl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSD_vpfikbE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WH5Afm"&gt;The Build Back Better portion of Biden’s infrastructure plan currently includes a provision to extend that credit and add another subsidy for electric vehicles made by union workforces, though it still needs to make it through the senate. Musk has derided the union-focused credit in recent months and &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-feud-biden-administration-51635729047?tesla=y"&gt;called Biden a “puppet” of the United Auto Workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFMLMq"&gt;Musk also said he doesn’t believe the US government should be giving out subsidies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22765438/biden-infrastructure-bill-electric-vehicle-ev-charging-level-2"&gt;expand charging infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; — though that provision is in the infrastructure bill that Biden already signed into law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHwEEc"&gt;“Do we need support for gas stations? We don’t. So there’s no need for this,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSMSBk"&gt;Tesla currently operates more than 3,000 charging stations with around 30,000 connectors worldwide, but plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;open that network to other electric vehicles sometime in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiW3WN"&gt;Musk’s companies have benefitted from many different federal and state subsidies over the years, and the government is a major SpaceX customer (though SpaceX won much of that business by dramatically undercutting the prices of established players). Tesla has also found tremendous success in China after receiving lots of help from the central government there. Musk said Monday that Tesla “did not anticipate any subsidies” when the company was in its early years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we’ve compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the latest Pros offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;While the AirPods Pro carry a lofty, $249.99 price tag, they also go on sale rather frequently. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw them drop to as low as $170. They’re no longer available at that low of a price, but you can still get a pair with the MagSafe charging case for $189.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9zDqO"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7OEaEgK25" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The latter retailer also has the last-gen configuration with the Qi-compatible wireless charging case for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9wsgbtVkT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off), and is throwing in six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus, if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps2LHc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10868644"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — now the entry-level model — with either a wired or wireless charging case. The base AirPods normally retail for $129, but currently, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods with a Qi-compatible wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. We saw them drop to $99 at Walmart during the most recent shopping holiday, but at the moment, you can only get them for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7OJt7pgP9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy and at Target for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1216671/2092?subId1=VergeBestWirelessEarbudsDeals12621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the Galaxy Buds Pro were more than $50 off, bringing the price down to around $150 — nearly an all-time low — in select colorways. They are still on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWifJWOA7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, however, but only for $159.99 ($40 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a subtle design — back in August, and we’re already starting to see some discounts at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for instance, you can get them at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $99.99&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo52gY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQroWm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall, but have since been discontinued with the arrival of the Galaxy Buds 2. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the $149.99 Galaxy Buds Plus in black for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months and likely one of the last major discounts we’ll see before the earbuds become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MjZMZR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live is a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. Right now, you can purchase a pair of the $169.99 Galaxy Buds Live in select colorways for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08J3Y4W5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, an $80 discount, or for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9wI2v49bF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Sony’s latest earbuds include better battery life and noise cancellation, as well as superior sound quality and IPX4 water resistance. Normally $279.99, they’re currently receiving a small discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to around $248. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="UMsK59"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;The predecessor to the WF-1000XM4, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, remain a terrific pair of earbuds that routinely go on sale. Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for around $128 ($72 off), their best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0sP2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They offer more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. You can currently buy the $229.99 Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfB2WVItB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;

The Jabra 75t are currently selling for $79.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, nearly their lowest price to date, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Sadly, these shiny new earbuds are currently only available for their full price of $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt5tpQYGc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL65GNM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="OvwTzC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ3wLT"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with the predecessor to the Studio Buds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07W5JZBVJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/2rKXO0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are selling the earphones in a handful of colorways for $149.95 and $179.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L75Qn4"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are also excellent noise-canceling wireless earbuds that are currently on sale. As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, the earbuds offer great ANC performance, customizable controls, and sound that can nearly match that of a premium pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones. Normally $299.95, you can buy them at Amazon for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085LW8N9Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; in white — their best price ever — or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-True-Wireless-Cancellation/dp/B085LVV8R7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$188.95&lt;/a&gt; in black. Note that the discount for the white earbuds will not show up until checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VIqEJG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882846"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m5v8fu"&gt;After testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That’s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds. They thus make great a choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. At the same time, we found they also offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy eight-hour battery life. Normally $249.99, you can get them right now for just &lt;a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/500013/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcustom.ultimateears.com%2Fproducts%2Fue-fits%3Firclickid%3DwiuzeN2aXxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkG2ya3h1ykOzY0%26utm_source%3Dradius%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26irgwc%3D1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169&lt;/a&gt; in various colors from Ultimate Ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3gZxqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10881349"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Like their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. The $119.99 earbuds also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound that’s remarkably satisfying, with more bass than the AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb3iGA"&gt;The second-gen Amazon Echo Buds are often discounted at most retailers. Currently, you can get the latest $119.99 Echo Buds with the wired charging case at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYSsVV4J8B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $69.99. Meanwhile, the $139.99 version with the wireless charging case is selling for $89.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTWYS4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWiFOTCoYJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. We should note, also, that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon offers an additional 25 percent discount&lt;/a&gt; if you trade in select devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I regret to inform you that Digital Human as a Service (DHaaS) is now an acronym </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XUqdfynHeOCJqNEf8YQ8A6hUA8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237636/aiko_digital_human_as_a_service.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSi2lL"&gt;Science fiction movies have prepared us for the distinct possibility that artificial intelligence will walk among us someday. How soon? No one can say — but that isn’t stopping a raft of companies by trying to sell “digital humans” before that whole &lt;em&gt;intelligence &lt;/em&gt;thing gets figured out. Ah, but what if you don’t want to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a digital human because that sounds icky? Rent one, of course! That’s why we now have the regrettable acronym Digital Human as a Service (DHaaS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFaazl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005441/en/KDDI-and-Mawari-to-Launch-a-Digital-Human-as-a-Service-DHaaS-Using-AWS-Wavelength/"&gt;The actual news here&lt;/a&gt; is that Japanese telecom giant KDDI has partnered with a firm named Mawari (which means something along the lines of “surroundings” in Japanese) to create a virtual assistant you can “see” through the window of your smartphone in augmented reality, one who might automatically pop up to give you directions and interact if you point your phone at a real-world location. (You’ll also see walking directions and indoor maps in the video, but those simply appear to be packaged together as part of the proof of concept.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Map68D"&gt;If you peek the video atop this post, you can see it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more advanced than, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761166/pokemon-go-ar-games-future-pikmin-harry-potter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But behind the scenes, the partners claim that KDDI’s 5G network, Amazon’s low-latency AWS Wavelength edge computing nodes, and a proprietary codec from Mawari combine to let “digital humans” stream to your phone in real time instead of running natively on your phone’s chip. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1d0_0rnC5gkPkp97ggcHl_XsXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23068620/aiko_digital_human_as_a_service.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsrMiR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the heavy processing requirements of real-time digital humans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaOtMZ"&gt;That “substantially lower[s] the heavy processing requirements of real-time digital humans, reducing cost, data size and battery consumption while unlocking scalability,” according to the press release. (It’s true that AR apps like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tend to chow down on battery, but it’s not just graphics to blame; some of that is running GPS, camera and cellular simultaneously.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvvEtZ"&gt;Who’s going to jump on board to actually populate the metaverse with experiences designed for KDDI and Mawari’s “digital humans” and pay monthly, quarterly or annually for the “service” part of the acronym? That’s always the question, but there’s no shortage of companies looking to lean into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the buzzy metaverse&lt;/a&gt; these days. And if they can leverage their existing buzzwords like “5G”, “AI” and “Edge compute,” so much the better. It takes a lot of work to look like you’re paying attention to the future, and you never know if this  is the moment someone actually manages to &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen"&gt;make fetch happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFSC2h-JZ0-lcBTLwMcFwudM67E=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/LG_A1_OLED_Lifestyle_Press_Image.16.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s A1 OLED is now available for just shy of $900, making it one of the most affordable OLEDs to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And while we saw some incredible TV deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, fret not, as there are still plenty available for those looking to pick up a TV for the holidays. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E3xT2B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PBNYtv"&gt;Select a category&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the PlayStation and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1I1ma7"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reason. It’s not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cart-6484511"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $599.99, the TV’s best price to date. The retailer is also offering a three-month Apple TV Plus subscription to new subscribers and $50 off a Google Nest Hub smart display with each purchase, as well as up to $200 off select soundbars and home theater systems. Walmart also is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1192602/9383?subId1=TheVergeBest4KTVDeals12221&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F482924%2F1192602%2F9383%3FsubId1%3DTheVergeBest4KTVDeals12221%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FSony-55-Class-KD55X80J-4K-Ultra-HD-LED-Smart-Google-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-HDR-X80J-Series-2021-model%252F919937738%26veh%3Daff&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting the TV down to $648&lt;/a&gt;, however, without the added incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $699.99&lt;/a&gt;, though, we’ve seen the R635 drop to as low as $650 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 65- and 75-inch variants. Both retailers are offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $999.99&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch for $1299.99&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, however, Best Buy will also take $90 off Facebook Portal TV, if you purchase the two together. The retailer is even throwing in 30 days of FuboTV Pro and three months of Apple TV Plus, so long as you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 55-inch drop from $1,500 to $998, its best price ever. Sadly, it’s now only $100 off, with the 55-inch model going for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,397.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,399.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Like with other TVs, Best Buy is also offering a $90 discount on the $150 Facebook Portal TV, as well as anywhere between $50 and $300 off on select soundbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ewayql"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok is now available on Samsung and LG TVs, Android TV devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796353/tiktok-tv-app-now-available-samsung-lg-google-android-tv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="hGcbAW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"},{"title":"How to choose the right TV for your home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973993/tv-buying-guide-oled-qled-lcd-hdr-dolby-vision-atmos-nits-backlighting"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick up the 55-inch model from &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $369.99&lt;/a&gt;, a $180 discount on what is its typical $549.99 price tag. Again, Best Buy will also take $90 off of Facebook Portal TV. Amazon, meanwhile, is also offering a modest discount on the TV but in other configurations. The retailer is selling the 43-inch, for example, for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7K3H7K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$249.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $289.99 and the 70-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08CVV2Z32/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$549.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of normally $579.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $499.99. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $399.99 ($120 off)&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching the TV’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for all Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08GWBBH4R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$379.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $220 less than the usual retail price. Other sizes are also on sale, like the 85-inch, which is currently going for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08RGB3P6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,599.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,899 — its best price on Amazon yet. We also recently saw the 50-inch drop to as low as $250, but it’s now only available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHFX4FV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$359.99&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not as steep as a discount, but it still saves you about $140. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SPPi6g"&gt;Amazon’s first TV, the Omni Fire 4K TV, only just recently launched and starts at $370. The self-branded effort features the ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off, as well as a low input lag and support for two-way video calling. We gave it a 7/10 in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, while noting how the TV shows great promise thanks to its robust Alexa integration and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, among other things. At the same time, however, TCL and other similarly priced television makers offer better picture quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u57i5n"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon was taking up to $150 off on select models, even going so far as to sell the 55-inch configuration for $410 instead of $560. Amazon has since raised the prices, but you can still buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $419.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $559.99. Larger and smaller configurations are also on sale, with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch going for $729.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $829.99. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7NAAAq36n" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is offering comparable sales on various sizes, while also offering a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV if you purchase the two together. Note, however, only the larger 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="robl5C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV, and many were heavily discounted during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you missed out on those sales, however, you may still have another shot at landing a good deal, as many of the best models are still currently available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfP5UO"&gt;Right now, Best Buy and Amazon are discounting select sizes of the LG’s entry-level A1 OLED, selling the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-48-class-a1-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6461914.p&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $899.99&lt;/a&gt; ($300 off) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Built-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED48A1PUA/dp/B092LZNZB7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$896.99&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The 4K A1 offers support for both Alexa and Google Assistant, as well as an automatic low-latency mode. Unlike more expensive OLEDs, however, it doesn’t come with a slate of advanced gaming features, like those found on LG’s C1 model. It offers a slower 60Hz display and lacks HDMI 2.1, for example, and doesn’t support a variable refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cKOBk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EC2RcQ"&gt;Unlike the A1, LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The TV also supports Dolby Atmos as well as 4K at 120Hz and a variable refresh rate. At the moment, the popular 65-inch model is discounted to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9xg5aTnsu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,709.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; ($90 off). The smaller, 55-inch model is also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FLGOLED55BXPUA&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at BuyDig for $1,369.99&lt;/a&gt;, 14 percent less than the OLED’s typical retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or next-gen consoles. Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for as low as $1,618.99&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy instead of $1,800. You can also buy it for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555065-REG%2Flg_oled55gxpua_gxpua_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,696.99 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or grab the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model at B&amp;amp;H for $2,297&lt;/a&gt;, which will save you $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED remains a Best Buy exclusive. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVB68Xg6uj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can currently get it for just $999.99&lt;/a&gt;, its best price to date, and it remains one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for an OLED. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. If you prefer a larger size, the 65-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCblSKnxi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available for $1,499.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, a cool $300 off the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ubtWst"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22773073/vizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line has slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It’s currently available in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, there's a $75 discount available on the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVowrPgJjE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and a larger $800 discount &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCmbeDxyh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on the 77-inch configuration&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $1,424.99 and $2,999.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,296.99 and $1,299.99, two of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model for $1,199.99&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy instead of $1,299.99, and the retailer will throw in a $200 discount on select soundbars as well as a $90 discount on Facebook Portal TV. Best Buy is also offering discounts on the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vUccDGJT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;-, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vUWfg4Xb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;77-&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vVCUSyDE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;83-inch&lt;/a&gt; variants, with the largest model selling for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9vUccDGJT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$4,999.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for as low as $1,299.99 ($500 off), however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are currently only discounting the TV to around $1,600 ($200 off). There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel Buds A-Series getting more options with firmware update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1cGUK68BUHLFA6_IqX6t-I_KIAY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237477/cwelch_20210528_4608_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q2DnAy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/139020686/new-features-coming-to-pixel-buds-a-series?hl=en"&gt;Google is releasing&lt;/a&gt; an update for its Pixel Buds A-Series wireless headphones, which will add a bass slider, a loudness compensation setting for better bass and treble response at low volumes, and a nice connectivity improvement (&lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/12/06/pixel-buds-a-series-update-brings-much-needed-bass-controls-and-better-device-switching/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Droid-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Given that the buds are only $99 (or free, if you got them with &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/10/pixel-6-buyers-will-get-their-free-pixel-buds-even-if-they-forgot-to-order.html"&gt;a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro preorder&lt;/a&gt;), it’s nice to see Google adding new features through software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oXJLE"&gt;As we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820593/google-pixel-december-feature-drop-quick-tap-to-snap-shortcut-ultra-wideband-nearby-share"&gt;learned earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, the Pixel Buds will be getting more control over the bass response. The buds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price"&gt;had a “bass boost” option before&lt;/a&gt;, but now you’ll be able to turn up the bass using a four-step slider — and you can even turn it down a notch if that’s what you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="igs58P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel Buds A-Series can fall back if they can’t connect to the last-used device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlx8YC"&gt;Google also says that if the Pixel Buds A-Series can’t connect to the last device you used them with, they’ll try to fall back to the device they were connected to before that. For example, if you were using the buds with your laptop that’s currently off, they could connect to your phone automatically when you take them out of the case if you had them connected to your phone before using them with your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRiYbm"&gt;Google says that the update, version 282, should be “rolling out over the coming days” and will install automatically if you’re using a Pixel running Android 10 or higher or if you’re using any phone with Android 6 or above that has the Pixel Buds app installed (as long as it has permission to see nearby devices). If you don’t like waiting for automatic updates, Google does provide instructions on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9642078"&gt;how to manually check for an update&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Japan puts new restrictions on stablecoins</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpSDQonmGGUdue_GtNEbnqGXhQ8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237350/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocfEBj"&gt;Japan is proposing new restrictions that would only allow banks and wire transfer services to issue stablecoins, first reported by &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Stablecoins-to-face-new-restrictions-in-Japan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5kUb1"&gt;Stablecoins are a type of digital currency that’s pegged to an external asset, like a fiat currency, gold, or other investments, in an attempt to keep the coin at a stable price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22620464/tether-backing-cryptocurrency-stablecoin"&gt;Tether is one example&lt;/a&gt; of a stablecoin, and it’s no stranger to controversy. In October, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728253/tether-41-million-misleading-statements-fiat-currency-bitfinex-cftc"&gt;was fined $41 million&lt;/a&gt; for old claims that each token was backed 1-to-1 by its cash reserves — according to the CFTC, “Tether reserves were not ‘fully backed’ the majority of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pjn6jK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This follows similar plans to regulate stablecoins in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CaI2Ay"&gt;The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to introduce the legislation in 2022, following similar plans to regulate stablecoins in the US. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"&gt;the US Treasury Department encouraged Congress&lt;/a&gt; to pass legislation that would prevent any other entities besides banks from issuing the currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqNPnX"&gt;The Treasury cites that this would help stave off “runs” in which people start cashing out coins all at once in fear that the issuer of the currency may go under, potentially destabilizing other financial markets as a result. Shortly after, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that the agencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800740/cryptocurrency-us-banking-regulation-clarification-financial-institutions-stablecoins"&gt;planned to clarify the rules and regulations&lt;/a&gt; surrounding cryptocurrencies in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptiKc7"&gt;In addition to the limitations on issuing stablecoins, Japan’s FSA also intends to tighten other rules. The agency will oversee wallet providers that engage in stablecoin transactions and require them to follow certain security protocols, like reporting any suspicious activity and verifying users’ identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaMej4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/consortium-japan-firms-test-launch-digital-currency-nikkei-2021-11-23/"&gt;Japan also plans on launching a yen-based cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. The currency — which may be called DCJPY — will be backed by bank transactions and is supposed to expedite large transfers of funds between companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund commits another $443 million to climate justice and conservation </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Week NYC Leaders Reception" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRcwrLPWPM5oLV6scd9IFOHD2N4=/0x144:4428x3096/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237330/1341676182.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 20: Jeff Bezos speaks during the Climate Week NYC Leaders’ Reception | Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Bezos Earth Fund&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k9nzvz"&gt;On Monday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced his Earth Fund’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bezos-earth-fund-announces-443-million-in-grants-to-advance-environmental-justice-conserve-and-restore-nature-and-improve-monitoring-and-accountability-301437650.html"&gt;latest round of grants&lt;/a&gt;: $443 million to be spent primarily on land conservation and restoration and efforts to reduce environmental burdens on marginalized communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcnu6C"&gt;This year, the fund has pledged more than $3 billion for similar initiatives. In 2020, Bezos promised to funnel $10 billion — about 5 percent of his current net worth — toward tackling climate change this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="85ShzK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From the beginning, the Bezos Earth Fund has faced criticism&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9CzR1W"&gt;From the beginning, the Bezos Earth Fund has faced &lt;a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/bezos-earth-fund-is-an-unnatural-disaster/"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from some grassroots environmental groups. At first, Bezos primarily funded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569902/jeff-bezos-first-recipients-10-billion-climate-change-fund"&gt;big-name environmental groups&lt;/a&gt; with historically white leadership and comparatively large budgets rather than supporting more Indigenous and people of color-led community groups, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266225/jeff-bezos-climate-change-earth-fund-amazon-pollution"&gt;critics pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. Other criticisms focused on how Amazon, the e-commerce giant Bezos founded, continues to pollute neighborhoods and emit increasing levels of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LSxWQ"&gt;Since that early backlash, environmental justice — a movement to stop pollution and environmental degradation from disproportionately harming low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and other vulnerable groups — has become a bigger part of the Bezos Earth Fund’s messaging. The fund’s latest round of funding sets aside $130 million for 19 different organizations doing “&lt;a href="https://www.bezosearthfund.org/announcements"&gt;doing critical climate justice work.&lt;/a&gt;” It follows another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662529/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-150-million-climate-justice-amazon"&gt;$150 million&lt;/a&gt; pledged to climate justice groups in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YDmU7"&gt;The $130 million for environmental justice in this latest round of funding is intended to support the Biden administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/07/20/the-path-to-achieving-justice40/"&gt;Justice40 Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after stepping into office in January, Biden created the initiative through an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; to make sure that “disadvantaged communities” receive 40 percent of the “overall benefits” of federal investments in clean energy and climate action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oHBBQ"&gt;Bezos’ grantees include a wide range of groups that either gather data to inform policymaking, help underserved communities become more resilient to climate change, support tribes and Native communities, or plan to create training programs for the Justice40 initiative. For example, GRID Alternatives, a nonprofit that works to increase access to solar power, will get $12 million for its Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEYvQF"&gt;The latest funding announcement also includes $261 million allocated to the &lt;a href="https://www.campaignfornature.org/cop15-countries-call-for-support-of-30x30-and-leaders-endorse-indigenous-rights-but-finance-commitments-fall-short"&gt;international initiative&lt;/a&gt; to conserve 30 percent of Earth’s lands and oceans by 2030. That will focus on creating, expanding, and monitoring so-called “protected areas” — mostly in the Congo Basin and Tropical Andes. According to the Bezos Earth Fund, the grants will create 11 million hectares of newly protected areas in the Congo Basin, where 70 percent of Africa’s forests are located. In the Tropical Andes, another important carbon sink for the planet, the grants will convert an estimated 48 million hectares into protected areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="NohxsA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creating, expanding, and monitoring so-called “protected areas”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8vOFe"&gt;Forests and other ecosystems are extremely important in the fight against climate change because they trap and store carbon dioxide, keeping it out of the atmosphere. But the establishment of new protected areas, especially when not carefully implemented, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770463/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-landscape-restoration-conservation-trees-indigenous-peoples"&gt;can actually harm local communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/Conservation.aspx"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.2021.1924574?journalCode=venv20"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of conservation efforts forcing Indigenous peoples off their lands to create national parks. The World Wildlife Fund, which is among Bezos’ grantees, was recently accused of failing to take responsibility for human rights abuses during a &lt;a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2021/11/wwf-distances-itself-from-rights-abuses-at-u-s-congressional-hearing/"&gt;US Congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;. That followed a &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/collection/wwfsecretwar"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that found that WWF-funded park rangers had been accused of murder, torture, and rape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YQtrxp"&gt;The Bezos Earth Fund says the newly protected areas will help “secure” local communities’  rights to 24 million hectares of land. It’s also spending an additional $25 million to kick off a new kind of “global mechanism” that could secure “support” for Indigenous peoples and local communities. Forests have tended to fare better under their care, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/6/3015"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows. There’s also an additional $51 million to restore landscapes in the US and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAFkTp"&gt;Closer to home for Bezos, Amazon was implicated in a recent report as playing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808388/amazon-target-port-congestion-pollution-maritime-shipping"&gt;“outsized” role&lt;/a&gt; in port congestion and associated shipping pollution along the west coast of the US. And despite Amazon’s commitments to address climate change, the company’s carbon footprint &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/amazon-says-carbon-emissions-rose-19percent-in-2020.html"&gt;grew by nearly 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?name=amazon-sustainability-2020-report"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony cameras are getting harder to buy due to the chip shortage</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NmWJZ6"&gt;The global chip shortage has claimed yet another camera from Sony’s lineup. This time, Sony is suspending orders for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702421/sony-alpha-zv-e10-review-vlogging-camera-test-price-specs"&gt;ZV-E10, a mirrorless vlogging camera&lt;/a&gt; that the company released in August, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/3172922224/another-one-bites-the-dust-sony-suspends-orders-of-its-zv-e10-camera-citing-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Photography Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vohSjp"&gt;Sony announced the camera’s suspension in a post &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20211203.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it will no longer sell the ZV-E10 on its store or through any of its distributors for the time being. “With regard to digital imaging products, parts procurement is delayed due to the effects of global semiconductor shortages,” a translation of Sony’s notice reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="khLg1v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is far from the only device that Sony has temporarily discontinued this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkpVRL"&gt;Unfortunately, this is far from the only device that Sony has temporarily discontinued this year. In November, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20211119.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony stopped selling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/30/7460095/sony-a7-ii-full-frame-camera-review"&gt;A7 II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266143/sony-a6400-review-mirrorless-compact-vlogging-camera"&gt;A6400&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836658/sony-a6600-a6100-camera-aps-c-mirrorless-price-specs-features"&gt;A1600&lt;/a&gt; series cameras, along with the ECM-B1M shotgun mic and PXW-Z190 camcorder. Sony also put the Handycam HDR-CX680 camcorder on hold &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sony.jp%2Fichigan%2Finfo2%2F20201203.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt;. The Sony A9 also &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/08/13/the-original-sony-alpha-9-appears-to-have-been-discontinued/"&gt;appears to be discontinued&lt;/a&gt; — or just in very short supply — as it’s listed as “No longer available” on both &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa9.html%3Futm_source%3Drflaid67085&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1333228-REG%2Fsony_ilce_9_b_alpha_a9_mirrorless_digital.html%3FfromDisList%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F6%2F22820922%2Fsony-digital-camera-chip-shortage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The same goes for the &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/08/31/sony-alpha-7r-ii-appears-finally-discontinued-after-6-years/"&gt;six-year-old Sony A7R II&lt;/a&gt;, which is also listed as unavailable on &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7r2.html&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-alpha-a7r-ii-full-frame-mirrorless-4k-video-camera-body-only-black%2F9591139.p&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCVekD"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;basically every other industry&lt;/a&gt; right now, camera companies are struggling to manufacture enough products to meet the demands of consumers. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.nikon-image.com/products/info/2021/0629_02.html"&gt;Nikon stopped including the EH-7P AC adapter&lt;/a&gt; with its Z7 and Z7 II cameras, as it just doesn’t have enough parts to go around. &lt;a href="https://cweb.canon.jp/eos/info/supply-announcement2007/"&gt;Canon has also announced&lt;/a&gt; shipping delays of up to “half a year” when you order its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673196/canon-eos-r3-camera-price-specs-release-date-announced"&gt;EOS R3&lt;/a&gt;, while shipping delays also hit Fujifilm for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21517015/fujifilm-x-s10-camera-vlogging-price-specs-features"&gt;X-S10&lt;/a&gt; and some of its other camera gear earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
