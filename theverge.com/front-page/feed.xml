    <title>Microsoft gets ready to launch the Surface Pro 8 I’ve been waiting years for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-7zSna8ddfUYSGi1KVXvr5UMkm0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887242/vpavic_191104_3776_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Surface Pro design has remained mostly the same since 2014. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gsu3rP"&gt;Microsoft is planning to launch its latest Surface Pro 8 tablet tomorrow. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell T&lt;em&gt;he Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the new Surface Pro 8 will ship with the biggest hardware design and specification changes since the Surface Pro 3 launch more than seven years ago. The Surface Pro 8 looks like the Surface Pro redesign I’ve long waited for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="js8iez"&gt;Microsoft is planning to bring most of the sleek design elements of the Surface Pro X to the Surface Pro 8. The tablet itself will be more rounded at the edges, and a new Surface keyboard will house a new slim Surface Pen inside just like the Pro X does. While the display bezels at the top and bottom of the Surface Pro 8 won’t be fully eliminated, they will be a lot smaller and nearly edge-to-edge on the sides. The Surface Pro 8 will still be slightly thicker  than the Pro X, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9UUrctJlTysaCtypYXi0VYL6sms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249909/akrales_190930_3688_0196.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro X design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tT6xoR"&gt;I’m also expecting Microsoft to replace the Surface Pro 8 display with a 120Hz panel that will make use of Windows 11’s new Dynamic Refresh Rate feature. Dynamic Refresh Rate is similar to how Apple’s high refresh-rate ProMotion displays operate, allowing the display to fluctuate between different refresh rates depending on tasks. Microsoft is primarily using this new Surface Pro 8 display to boost inking performance on the device, and make scrolling in web pages and certain apps a lot smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uC6ygP"&gt;Inking improvements on the Surface Pro 8 will be significant thanks to this new display, and an updated Surface Pen. The same slim stylus design found on the Pro X will be available on the Pro 8, and Microsoft is making some solid improvements here. The new Surface Pen will support haptic feedback so you get the subtle sensations from drawing, and the tip has been improved for better pressure sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJDKv8_l0HBnrEFtd81TlIv27cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19249906/akrales_190930_3688_0094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro 8 will include a slim Surface Pen like the Pro X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="us9Go3"&gt;Microsoft is also moving to Thunderbolt on the Surface Pro 8, ditching the USB-A port and moving to two USB-C ports that will support high-speed data transfers. Again, this is similar to the Surface Pro X which also ships with dual USB-C ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQkI2d"&gt;When I reviewed the Surface Pro 7 two years ago, I said “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;I wish this looked like a Surface Pro X,&lt;/a&gt;” and the Pro 8 delivers on most of the Pro X improvements. Microsoft is sticking with Intel’s 11th Gen chips inside, which means the big differences between a regular Surface Pro and the Surface Pro X will be down to battery life and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhYTvB"&gt;If the Surface Pro 8 can deliver solid battery life, this could be the best Intel-powered Surface Pro ever. After years of refining the design of the Surface Pro 3, the Surface Pro 8 is set for a design overhaul just in time for Windows 11 with its refreshed UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atRpVj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all of Microsoft’s Surface news tomorrow. We’re expecting the Surface Pro 8, a new Surface Book design, Surface Pro X updates, a Surface Go 3, and the Surface Duo 2. Microsoft’s event kicks off at 11AM ET on September 22nd, and we’ll be covering all the news live.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap has new Lenses that show users how to fingerspell in American Sign Language</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New lenses will help Snapchat uses learn to fingerspell in American Sign Language" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4wVptlyEVhwrg9hTphmgTXmmaw=/0x170:501x504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887115/signlang.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aGqjXM"&gt;To mark the &lt;a href="https://wfdeaf.org/iwdeaf2021/"&gt;International Week of the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;, Snapchat has created custom stickers and three AR Lenses to encourage users to fingerspell, the company said Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnqT1j"&gt;The new features were designed by incorporating feedback and guidance from deaf and hard-of-hearing employees at the company, and using AI and computer vision technology developed by Hungarian startup SignAll, which focuses on technology for deaf people. SignAll has developed technology that can be used to track hand movements to translate sign language into spoken language. The company launched fingerspelling &lt;a href="https://www.signall.us/newsroom/ace-asl-the-ai-powered-sign-language-app-from-signall-is-now-available-on-android"&gt;mobile app Ace ASL&lt;/a&gt; for iOS in April, and for Android earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axmft0"&gt;The new Snap features were also driven internally by Snap Lab software engineer Jennica Pounds, who is deaf. Pounds said her oldest son has had a hard time learning American Sign Language, which was a big motivation for her to work on the new tools. “I’m passionate about this technology because I truly believe it’s going to break so many applications wide open,” she said in a news release. “It’s tech like this that will help families like mine communicate and grow together.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3e4OQw-N5fGelEd_rEPDoIp-HF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865092/sign_sticker.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Snap sticker with the ASL sign for “I love you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lxabyJ"&gt;The AR Lenses will help Snap users learn to fingerspell their names, along with common words like “love,” “hug,” and “smile.” They can capture and share the experiences with other users in chat. And there’s also a new group of Bitmoji stickers showing some commonly signed terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wONqEf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tt13Db"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast and UK subsidiary Sky reportedly launching smart TVs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1o1CeWz7B5-WaInFcndLYSDqdLo=/0x0:708x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887062/background.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BtlPH0"&gt;Comcast appears to be planning to offer TVs running its own software across at least two territories, according to recent &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/comcast-xclass-tv-hisense"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eec0e585-dd24-4ef7-9a23-ed2afccb7269"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brvfpE"&gt;In the US, the TVs will reportedly be branded as XClass TVs. Originally manufactured by Hisense, the 43 and 50-inch sets will run Comcast’s X1 operating system, which is already found on its set-top boxes and Xfinity Flex streaming box. An &lt;a href="https://id.platco.xfinity.com/login?execution=e1s1"&gt;Xfinity landing site&lt;/a&gt; confirms the “XClass TV” branding, while an FAQ spotted by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; says they’ll aggregate “your favorite apps, live channels, and On Demand movies and shows together in one place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mGvW8G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apps, live channels, and On Demand movies and shows together in one place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPt0Ft"&gt;Meanwhile in the UK, Comcast subsidiary Sky is reportedly planning to launch smart TVs of its own. &lt;em&gt;The FT&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t mention what operating system these TVs are likely to run. Sky already operates its Sky Q platform in the country, which currently runs on set-top boxes and shows satellite broadcasts alongside video streamed from services like Netflix and Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x87c0N"&gt;Comcast declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;on its report. In the UK, Sky confirmed that it’s always exploring new technologies, but declined to comment on “product rumors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7J9qiv"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, the initiatives appear to be Comcast’s attempt to insulate itself as customers turn away from traditional cable and satellite plans in favor of streaming services. By offering a platform that competes with the likes of Roku, Comcast would be able to maintain its direct relationship with customers. It could then aggregate content from other streaming providers alongside its own Peacock and Xumo streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63zKPx"&gt;Controlling the viewing platform also gives Comcast and its subsidiaries the ability to negotiate with streaming providers to offer them better prominence on its platforms, the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; notes. Netflix in particular is well known for paying manufacturers to place dedicated shortcut buttons on its remotes, and &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports that the XClass TV’s remote will have shortcut buttons to Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Kxn0F"&gt;As well as smart TVs, in the UK Sky is also reportedly testing a version of its Sky Q service that runs solely over the internet rather than satellite, &lt;a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2021/08/sky-uk-allegedly-trial-broadband-tv-service-without-satellite.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISPreview&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The plans were first announced back in 2017, and the company has already launched similar products in &lt;a href="https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2021/08/02/without-cable-or-satellite-sky-deutschland-launches-sky-q-over-ip/"&gt;European countries like Germany&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s yet to announce an official launch in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db1yFz"&gt;Without an official announcement, it’s uncertain when the TVs could hit the market in either country. But in the UK, Sky is planning a launch event on October 7th, when it’s teasing that “something magical is coming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8fdwQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2I6ZN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches free, first-of-its-kind Android mobile plan in Kenya </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8opmfhocKcaqEft8F7kgSAazbLQ=/0x37:422x318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887037/NFLX_FREEPLANLAUNCH_UI_3_c__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d2mO2C"&gt;Netflix is launching a new free Android mobile plan in Kenya that will allow users to watch a limited selection of its catalog, including full seasons of select shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQnrh0"&gt;Netflix announced that &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya"&gt;beginning this week&lt;/a&gt;, the new ad-free Netflix mobile plan for Android gives users the option to sign up without having to enter any payment information (though they’ll need to verify that they’re 18 or older and will still need to submit an email address to create a login). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2sR6UB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix hopes users will upgrade to a paid subscription&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bQNWOv"&gt;A Netflix spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s the first time the streamer has offered a free tier. Roughly a quarter of its library will be included in the free plan, and users on this tier will be able to watch entire seasons of shows. Netflix said it hopes that users who enjoy using the service will eventually upgrade to one of its paid subscriptions, which support streaming from TVs and laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEStzf"&gt;Netflix has experimented with free-to-stream content before in an attempt to woo new subscribers. It previously made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;some of its content&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289576/netflix-trial-of-the-chicago-7-free-youtube-limited-time"&gt;available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and the company experimented with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21408344/netflix-watch-free-two-popes-bird-box-stranger-things-promotional-campaign"&gt;free-to-watch portal&lt;/a&gt; with a small selection of titles after it permanently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;axed its free trial period&lt;/a&gt; in the US. HBO Max, which also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154553/hbo-max-ditches-one-week-free-trial-ahead-of-wonder-woman-1984"&gt;killed its free trial&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;’s day-and-date release on the service, has similarly experimented with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608403/hbo-max-new-subscribers-free-episodes"&gt;offering limited episodes&lt;/a&gt; for free to boost its subscriber numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyIvyc"&gt;Netflix’s free Android plan for users in Kenya launched Monday and will continue rolling out over the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So Snoop Dogg just claimed to be a prominent NFT booster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Snoop Dogg’s tweet claiming to be Cozomo Medici" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Br2Y2y1ojayCOZ7fpSon65CefNY=/0x0:954x636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69886144/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_3.04.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1nSjbx"&gt;Snoop Dogg, the famous rapper, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?s=20"&gt;tweeted on Monday&lt;/a&gt; that he’s the one behind a Twitter account that discusses NFTs. Yes, this really is a thing that’s happened. While Snoop Dogg &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.com%2Fnft%2Fdrops-event%2F80b2e021d4cbfbc43789db5377ecf1ed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22684780%2Fsnoop-dog-nft-booster-cozomo-medici-reveal-prank-crypto" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has released NFTs before&lt;/a&gt;, that’s not really anything new for celebrities — running &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici"&gt;a Twitter account that constantly tweets about crypto&lt;/a&gt;, and owning around a hundred of the crypto tokens, however, would be another level. Is this reveal real? A prank? It’s unclear, but it sure is &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6UXBWz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/"&gt;@CozomoMedici&lt;/a&gt; (seemingly named after a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosimo_de%27_Medici"&gt;prominent Renaissance-era Italian banker&lt;/a&gt;) is a Twitter account that’s amassed quite a few followers in the month or two it’s been active and talking about crypto. Part of what’s made the account splashy is that it’s seemingly &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xce90a7949bb78892f159f428d0dc23a8e3584d75"&gt;spent millions on NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. The person behind the Medici account has been talking about releasing their personal details for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1438617782585724934?s=20"&gt;at least a few days now&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1438903417246650368?s=20"&gt;running a poll&lt;/a&gt; inviting people to guess at their true identity. (No, Snoop Dogg was not one of the options, but AOC and the lead singer of Muse were). It culminated today with the person behind the account announcing that they were going to tweet their identity from their personal account, saying that it would be discovered because they’re considerably famous. Five minutes later, Snoop Dogg tweeted “I am @CozomoMedici.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SrCyjn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Shortly, as promised, I will dox from my personal account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As my fame is considerable, the tweet will no doubt be discovered. Those who are curious to my identity will soon know it.&lt;/p&gt;— Cozomo de’ Medici (@CozomoMedici) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1440037291771121668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="j7h1sO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;I am &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CozomoMedici&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Snoop Dogg (@SnoopDogg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="enk2E7"&gt;It’s tempting to use Medici’s involvement with Jason Derulo, singer of “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBI3lc18k8Q"&gt;Whatcha Say&lt;/a&gt;” and “Wiggle (feat. Snoop Dogg),” as evidence of his prominence in the space. The R&amp;amp;B artist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonderulo/status/1436090353103237132"&gt;thanked Medici for helping him purchase a CryptoPunk&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, but today’s (possible) reveal raises the question: did Derulo look to Medici because they were prominent in the NFT space, or did he know it was actually &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiP14ED28CA"&gt;one of his peers&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you see an excellent NFT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClwZaH"&gt;While the Medici account is relatively new, only being created last month, it’s still managed to gain some notoriety, having been mentioned in &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117605/art-blocks-hit-generative-artist-5-38-million"&gt;a story by crypto outlet &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Medici OpenSea account also has around 100 NFTs &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici"&gt;in its collection&lt;/a&gt; (some of which were purchased for millions of dollars worth of Ethereum). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oTYSCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CeBfmt"&gt;I know the question you’re asking... no, screaming... no, freestyle rapping at your monitor: has Cozomo de Medici bought any Snoop Dogg-themed NFTs? Well, of course I went and snooped on &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici"&gt;their OpenSea account&lt;/a&gt;, and I found some things that would be pretty amusing if Medici turns out to actually be Snoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXGyhv"&gt;First, a few minutes after Snoop tweeted his confession, the Medici account bought two weed-themed NFTs &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/Cozomo_de_Medici?identifier=Cozomo_de_Medici&amp;amp;search%5BsortBy%5D=LAST_SALE_PRICE&amp;amp;search%5BsortAscending%5D=false&amp;amp;search%5Bquery%5D=nyandogg"&gt;by an artist named NyanDogg&lt;/a&gt;. The account has also been sent a cloud of &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x40d1587cb0bd9e2bcf7ab16c857d9a9fd881d445/1036"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x6f0365ca2c1dd63473f898a60f878a07e0f68a26/6056"&gt;Snoop-themed&lt;/a&gt; NFTs since the reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FGYQYiIYnyg-WCFolfVRDHlKw3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865598/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_2.45.35_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the NyanDogg NFTs purchased by Medici.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eDSsre"&gt;Hey, wait, isn’t that Snoop’s Twitter avatar?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Owp6CYJkAgKFCRNT0phgX4qczKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865604/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_2.46.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;By George it is!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ocbRnT"&gt;There is, of course, the possibility that this is a troll on Snoop Dogg’s part, or that Medici and Snoop coordinated this and the real Medici’s identity is still unknown. The Medici Twitter account has liked a ton of tweets relating to Snoop Dogg’s, but to be honest, if Snoop claimed to be &lt;em&gt;me,&lt;/em&gt; I’d like tweets about it too, despite the fact that I’m not actually Snoop Dogg (as far as you know).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tweet retweeted by Snoop Dogg reading: “with so much drama in the N-F-Ts it’s kinda hard being @CozomoMedici   but he somehow some way keep buyin’ up slick ass jpegs like every day”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LMKe9LUB6MnbhqOXqD2qklt-FzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865665/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_3.05.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZQSn1"&gt;It’s hard to tell what the fallout from all this will be. Will Snoop Dogg become a thought leader in the NFT space? Will more celebrities come out as having run crypto accounts (perhaps Snoop’s friend &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a37637908/snoop-dogg-martha-stewart-tasty-halloween/"&gt;Martha Stewart&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650594/banksy-nft-scam-pranksy-ethereum-returned-duplicates-art"&gt;Pranksy&lt;/a&gt;)? Or will this whole thing turn out to have been an elaborate prank?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0grwA"&gt;At the moment, the answer to all of those questions is unclear, but there is one concrete consequence of Snoop’s tweet: his mentions are now filled with people pitching him NFT projects. Never thought I’d have that in common with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Y87nT"&gt;Final note: while, again, I cannot stress enough that there’s no hard evidence linking Snoop and the Medici account, there’s one more critical clue to point out: Medici often &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1440037293327142923?s=20"&gt;signs off tweets with a wine emoji&lt;/a&gt;. You know who has his own brand of wine? &lt;a href="https://www.19crimes.com/wines"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. Case closed everyone, we’ve totally nailed it down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 is here, but we’re still waiting on a few new features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uTvpFRQlKmImpD52gaTU3bIBhxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885760/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IXnra3"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;finally here&lt;/a&gt;, but not all of the features announced at WWDC have made it alongside them. We looked through Apple’s product pages for each OS to find the features that have yet to show up on iPhones and iPads, such as SharePlay, improved AirPod Find My support, Universal Control, and more. Except for Universal Control, which isn’t for iPhones (yet), every feature listed is missing from both platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IuMGZs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="T85EhV"&gt;Perhaps the most prominent missing feature is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music"&gt;SharePlay&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users watch videos or listen to music with friends on a FaceTime call. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;warned us (and developers)&lt;/a&gt; about the delay after removing SharePlay from beta tests, but it’s still a bit awkward given how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;significant the feature looked&lt;/a&gt; at first. Its delay is worse because it’s holding other features back — Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673993/apple-fitness-plus-workouts-countries-languages-pilates-snow"&gt;recently announced that Group Workouts for Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; is on hold until SharePlay comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soYqFI"&gt;Apple also says that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522951/apple-airpods-find-my-hearing-accesibility-notification-wwdc"&gt;better Find My support for AirPods&lt;/a&gt; isn’t coming until later this fall. The feature was announced at WWDC, with Apple saying that some of the devices in its headphone lineup are getting an AirTag-like proximity view. The AirPods Pro and Max will be able to connect to the Find My network, making them easier to find even when they’re not physically with you. As someone who is currently missing a set of AirPods (and whose hope of finding them is draining like the earbud’s batteries), this is probably the delay that hurts the most.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vHPq_jOwqHoa1-MxP4HTuNrMMeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865217/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_12.53.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What I wouldn’t give...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S5lASs"&gt;The App Store’s in-app events feature, which will show off things like in-game events, live video streams, and other limited-time features, is also not here yet. It’s labeled with the same asterisk as the other features, saying that it’s “coming later this fall.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gNtlEPzGHNePMDIYLsOI70uprtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865204/Screen_Shot_2021_09_20_at_12.48.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/in-app-events/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An in-app event shown off on the app’s page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWZy9y"&gt;iPad users will also have to wait for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;incredible-looking Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt;, which seamlessly lets you share a cursor between Macs and iPads. It missing the launch shouldn’t be a surprise: unlike SharePlay, Universal Control didn’t show up in the betas, and the feature also requires the not-yet-released macOS Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UcgnEo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Universal Control on macOS Monterey works","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bfXTov"&gt;Of course, it’s worth mentioning that two of these features could be waiting on new hardware — another Apple event this fall seems likely, with predictions focusing on new MacBook Pros and AirPods. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;As I try to remind myself&lt;/a&gt;, rumors should be taken with a grain of salt, but it makes sense that Apple will wait to launch a new version of macOS along with new hardware if it’s really that close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSps2j"&gt;If you want to read more about the features that did make it into iOS and iPadOS 15, check out my colleague Chaim’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;titanic review&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s new updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to fix Deathloop ‘stuttering’ issues on PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSKgq9V7V_faIif-gORFVpgmnAE=/429x0:2589x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885518/deathloop.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EojSD0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the big triple-A game of the moment, and it’s an amazing experience — assuming you’re not fighting your gaming PC to get it to run smoothly. Bethesda is aware, and a patch seems to be on the way. But as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Alex Battaglia explains in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu_XHyO-6zY"&gt;this in-depth video&lt;/a&gt;, there may be a few things you can try right now to fix it, including one weird, counterintuitive trick that instantly made my seemingly stuttery performance smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flFyMD"&gt;Here’s the TL;DR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9x4UgO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Obvious:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduce your quality settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lk2mRz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Far less obvious: &lt;/strong&gt;Try the beta hotfix: “juliannashotme” in Steam &amp;gt; Deathloop &amp;gt; Properties &amp;gt; Betas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aCrtfP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Counterintuitive: &lt;/strong&gt;Lock your framerate at 60 or 120fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ydt9Pq"&gt;Let’s start with that last one, because it’s what worked for me — and it may be the only thing that works if you’ve got a fancy G-Sync / FreeSync monitor with variable refresh rate. Simply go to the game’s &lt;strong&gt;Video Settings &lt;/strong&gt;page, turn off &lt;strong&gt;V-Sync&lt;/strong&gt; entirely, and set your &lt;strong&gt;FPS Limiter&lt;/strong&gt; to 60 or — if your performance is high enough — 120 fps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0TTplP6vb5HA_GerONCujKTZhSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865395/deathloop_fps_limiter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down the video settings menu and you’ll find V-Sync and FPS Limiter. You’ll have to turn off V-Sync first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MJjnuC"&gt;You might be asking: “Isn’t the whole point of V-Sync and my fancy VRR monitor to keep this sort of stutter from happening?” Yes, but as &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry &lt;/em&gt;explains, what you’re seeing has more to do with mouse movement than syncing your GPU’s frames to your monitor’s refresh rate. This isn’t the tearing you see when frames hit in the middle of a refresh, or the microstutter you might have experienced when frames are delayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tm0oL8"&gt;In fact, Battaglia shows that &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; can deliver excellent frame times — there’s just a mismatch when you’re turning your digital character’s head at non-standard refresh rates, like the ones your variable refresh monitor is &lt;em&gt;designed &lt;/em&gt;to provide. With an RTX 3080, my GPU could easily send 80 fps to my G-Sync monitor in many scenes at near-4K resolution, but locking it to 60 counterintuitively made everything feel far smoother. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTiD7I"&gt;Another thing you might want to do (though you may also want to &lt;em&gt;undo&lt;/em&gt; it&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after the next public patch: try the hotfix &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deathloop/status/1438540739856715788"&gt;that Bethesda’s currently asking users to help test&lt;/a&gt;. Right click on &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; in your Steam library, select &lt;strong&gt;Properties &lt;/strong&gt;and then &lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;, type &lt;strong&gt;juliannashotme&lt;/strong&gt; into the access code field, hit &lt;strong&gt;Check Code&lt;/strong&gt;, then and &lt;strong&gt;Opt into&lt;/strong&gt; the public_beta branch that should appear. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zOoYdaCHIyqHA1h6wwX-flwdCvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865439/Vqbx0fxvgO.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll have to hit Check Code and also Opt into before the beta hotfix will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gYDNFo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reports the beta seems to smooth over one of the mouse issues, though Battaglia still points out other problems in his full video, including one where you may need to quit out of a mission or start the next level before it resolves itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvb9Y2"&gt;Lastly, it’s possible you’re just picking graphical settings that are unnecessarily high for what’s quite a demanding game. &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; looks great at High levels of detail, often with little noticeable difference compared to Very High or Ultra, as you can see in the video atop this post. Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vh3sSu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Now the SEC is investigating Activision Blizzard too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QB94muiygO1AS15egYLxz6xqgZk=/99x0:1101x668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69885343/Activision_Blizzard_Merge_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKsdHJ"&gt;The list of government agencies investigating Activision Blizzard has grown to now include the SEC. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080"&gt;has subpoenaed the video game publishing giant&lt;/a&gt;, including CEO Bobby Kotick, for records pertaining to employment, separation agreements, and communications between senior executives. The Wall Street Journal report says that the SEC is investigating whether Activision Blizzard disclosed information about harassment and discrimination claims to investors in a timely fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddO2Uy"&gt;Two months ago, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;for facilitating a culture of abuse, harassment, and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. The suit alleges that employees engaged in activities like a “cube crawl” in which men drank large amounts of alcohol while moving from workstation to workstation “groping” or otherwise harassing female employees. There was also an account of the infamous “Cosby suite” in which Blizzard employees set up a room at Blizzcon in 2013 where men attempted to ply women with alcohol in efforts to sleep with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22siyG"&gt;In the aftermath of the initial suit, Blizzard employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; and formed an employee activist group agitating for an end to forced arbitration and greater transparency regarding pay and diverse hiring practices. A number of Blizzard executives have either left the company or disappeared from the public eye. J. Allen Brack, CEO of Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;stepped down on August 3rd&lt;/a&gt;. That same day, head of global human resources &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;Jesse Meschuk also left the company&lt;/a&gt;. Brack was named in the lawsuit as having known of and failing to address the abuse against female employees and Blizzard HR was also cited as complicit party accused of overlooking or under-investigating claims of harassment and other violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7kRxp"&gt;Frances Townsend — Activision Blizzard’s vice president of corporate affairs and former Homeland Security advisor — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;called the lawsuit “a distorted and untrue picture of our company.&lt;/a&gt;” After fierce social media backlash to her comments, CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;issued a press release&lt;/a&gt; that called Blizzard’s response to the lawsuit “tone deaf” and promised action that included, among other things, employee listening sessions. According to a source at Blizzard, those listening sessions were little more than “propaganda sessions” and ended after employees complained of their quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObNtmi"&gt;This newest investigation is the latest in a string of cases brought against Activision Blizzard. Last week, Blizzard employee activist group A Better ABK, with help from the CODE-CWA — a digital workers labor organization — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674269/activision-blizzard-sued-nlrb-labor-violations"&gt;filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20210910-charge-activision-violation-of-section-7-rights.pdf"&gt;The complaint alleges&lt;/a&gt; Activision Blizzard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I4hW2C"&gt;Threatened employees that they cannot talk about or communicate about wages, hours and working conditions; told employees they cannot communicate with or discuss ongoing investigations of wages, hours and working conditions; maintained an overly broad social media policy; enforced the social media policy against employees who have engaged in protected concerted activity; threatened or disciplined employees on account of protected concerted activity; engaged in surveillance of employees engaged in protected concerted activity and engaged in interrogation of employees about protected concerted activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="efW4WI"&gt;According to the Wall Street Journal, Activision Blizzard is cooperating with the investigation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GTfk7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX4xRc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenSea has an app, but you can’t buy NFTs on it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iC7t2TBgRok7frJkRFb75byos-I=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884718/new_ios_app.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OpenSea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4A8Dxz"&gt;OpenSea, one of the most popular NFT marketplaces, has &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-the-opensea-mobile-app/"&gt;launched its first app&lt;/a&gt; for iOS and Android. The app allows OpenSea users to view the platform’s collection of digital items, but notably doesn’t allow for any kind of money to change hands, digital or otherwise (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/opensea-released-an-app-but-its-for-browsing-not-buying-and-selling/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybGWiw"&gt;The OpenSea app basically works as a kind of gallery. You can browse artwork, share listings you find, and lovingly ogle and manage your own NFTs. The app shares a lot of the same blue and white stylings of the OpenSea site, just missing the button that says “Buy Now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2MuHcc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKt59kExL-o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="470Qz0"&gt;There are a couple possible reasons why actual NFT purchases are missing. At the most obvious, highest level, OpenSea probably doesn’t want to share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; of NFT transactions with the likes of Apple and Google. That doesn’t help the people selling the work, and it doesn’t help OpenSea. The other complicating factor is that OpenSea’s payments are frequently in Ethereum, which currently isn’t supported as an in-app payment method on either platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruErxz"&gt;On paper, the OpenSea app furthers the company’s goal of “making NFTs more available to all,” but without the key economic element — the one being sold to struggling artists and speculated upon by hungry investors — it’ll first and foremost be another way to look at nice JPEGs. The app is also launching at an awkward time for the company. OpenSea head of product Nate Chastain made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677793/opensea-product-chief-resign-nft-insider-trading-accusations"&gt;a high-profile exit from the company&lt;/a&gt; last week following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676075/opensea-insider-information-nft-trading-nate-chastain"&gt;accusations of insider NFT trading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Surface hardware event: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E08s42Hw9b1y-XqXLab63Oq2YRY=/100x0:1179x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69884608/microsoft_surface_event_invite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A variety of new hardware updates are expected from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on September 22nd&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="epbR7Z"&gt;September 22nd officially marks the first day of fall, and with it gadget season. Like in previous years, Microsoft is getting into the mix with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651859/microsoft-surface-event-date"&gt;forthcoming Surface event&lt;/a&gt;, where we anticipate the company will announce a slew of products during its livestream presentation on Wednesday at 11AM ET / 8AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1u7z3"&gt;Microsoft has been building up plenty of momentum recently with the impending launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600261/windows-11-beta-release-insider-microsoft-download-test"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. And with the new operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649940/windows-11-release-date-features-devices-free-upgrade"&gt;set to launch on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, it’s only natural to showcase it with new devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdDxfF"&gt;The reports and leaks seem to indicate that we may see updates to Microsoft’s Surface Pro, Surface Book, Surface Go, and Surface Duo lines. Many details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682271/surface-pro-8-120hz-display-thunderbolt-support-leak-rumors"&gt;Surface Pro 8 have already leaked&lt;/a&gt;, including its new Intel 11th Gen processor, 120Hz display, and switch to Thunderbolt ports. While less early info has surfaced on the Book and Go refreshes, the former is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671271/microsoft-surface-event-pro-8-surface-book-4-rumors"&gt;slotted to have a significant design overhaul&lt;/a&gt; while the latter will most likely see its changes happen on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vvsf0"&gt;Beyond Windows 11 devices, Microsoft is expected to announce a successor to the dual-screen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;leaks for the Duo 2 began earlier in the summer&lt;/a&gt;, promising an internal spec bump and a new triple-camera setup in addition to some smaller design tweaks. The big questions around the Duo 2 are in software and support, as the original Duo’s stagnation — it’s still stuck on Android 10 when Android 12 is around the corner — and slow sales have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/13/22433893/microsoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal"&gt;landed it in the clearance sections of many retailers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoWh9B"&gt;Regardless of whether Microsoft actually proves its Android chops with the Duo 2 or launches any surprises with its new flagships for Windows 11, we’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here as new products are announced.&lt;/p&gt;
