    <title>Snap’s new Spectacles let you see the world in augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyXHurRX5_JcPrEa1e_CWQLaQpE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318328/Spectacles_KatVHarris_Portrait.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bdAtUx"&gt;Snap’s new Spectacles glasses are its most ambitious yet. But there’s a big catch: you can’t buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KyxKs"&gt;On Thursday, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel unveiled the company’s first true augmented reality glasses, technology that he and rivals like Facebook think will one day be as ubiquitous as mobile phones. A demo showed virtual butterflies fluttering over colorful plants and landing in Spiegel’s extended hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6OcHH"&gt;The new Spectacles have dual waveguide displays capable of superimposing AR effects made with Snapchat’s software tools. The frame features four built-in microphones, two stereo speakers, and a built-in touchpad. Front-facing cameras help the glasses detect objects and surfaces you’re looking at so that graphics more naturally interact with the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wIxmlJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The next generation of Spectacles can help unlock a new way to use AR hands-free”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8nghss"&gt;These Spectacles, however, aren’t ready for the mass market. Unlike past models, Snap isn’t selling them. Instead, it’s giving them directly to an undisclosed number of AR effects creators through an application program online. (Another indication they aren’t ready for everyday use: the battery only lasts 30 minutes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbMbFD"&gt;The idea is to encourage a small portion of the 200,000 people who already make AR effects in Snapchat to experiment with creating experiences for the new Spectacles, according to Spiegel. Like the bright yellow vending machines Snap used to sell the first version of Spectacles several years ago, the approach could end up being a clever way to build buzz for the glasses ahead of their wide release. Spiegel has said that AR glasses will take roughly a decade to reach mainstream adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eBo0cJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Step into the future with the next generation of Spectacles. Our first display glasses built for creators to explore new ways to fuse fun and utility through immersive AR. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnapPartnerSummit?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SnapPartnerSummit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/r4XnSC886z"&gt;https://t.co/r4XnSC886z&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4bPi49KE7n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4bPi49KE7n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spectacles (@Spectacles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spectacles/status/1395438513152159749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAteAd"&gt;“I don’t believe the phone is going away,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview this week. “I just think that the next generation of Spectacles can help unlock a new way to use AR hands-free, and the ability to really roam around with your eyes looking up at the horizon, out at the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSRl6D"&gt;The first two generations of Spectacles, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13671164/snapchat-spectacles-glasses-review-camera-sunglasses"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17279434/snapchat-spectacles-pricing-availability-snap-wearable-camera"&gt; and 2018&lt;/a&gt;, looked like sunglasses with a single camera in the corner of the frame. They let you snap videos (and later photos) in a unique, spherical format that could then be transferred to your phone and posted to Snapchat or another social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ZlyJR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A touchpad lets you switch between the AR effects you’re seeing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="533QIv"&gt;Snap, which calls itself a camera company, started moving more toward AR in 2019 with the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20951783/snap-spectacles-3-review-snapchat-glasses-price-specs-features"&gt;its third-generation Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;. That model added a second camera to detect depth in videos, allowing for more advanced effects to be applied afterward. But they lacked displays. You had to shoot a video, import it to Snapchat, and then apply AR effects — which Snap calls Lenses — later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJNBhW"&gt;The new fourth generation of Spectacles come from a secretive hardware division of the company called Snap Lab, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-plans-hardware-push-with-ar-spectacles-drone"&gt;also working on a camera drone&lt;/a&gt;. They weigh 134 grams, more than double the weight of the previous version but far less than Microsoft’s Hololens AR headset. They’re designed to be worn indoors or outdoors with up to 2,000 nits of display brightness, a tradeoff the company clearly made to favor display richness at the expense of battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20lfrb"&gt;Two front-facing cameras use the software Snap built for its mobile phone Lenses to automatically detect physical surfaces and place effects in a way that doesn’t obstruct the real world. Two stereo speakers capture audio and allow for the wearer to control them by voice. A touchpad on the side of the frame operates an interface in the displays that Snap calls the Lens Carousel, allowing the wearer to switch AR effects they’re seeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bLrnr"&gt;The new Spectacles were announced Thursday at Snap’s virtual Partner Summit for developers, where the company previewed a number of new augmented reality features for Snapchat. Its AR clothing try-on tech can now handle watches and glasses, and businesses will be able to more easily add AR versions of their online catalogs for Snapchat’s 500 million monthly users to try and purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xEuxm5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to invent a whole new way of interacting with computing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hqFAym"&gt;A new feature, called Connected Lenses, allows multiple people to see and interact with the same scene in AR. Snap is also launching an AR “innovation lab” called Ghost and is committing $3.5 million to support creators making effects, with another $1 million in funding with Verizon to fund AR experiences used over 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9CtqbE"&gt;While Snap is known primarily for the Snapchat app now, these Spectacles indicate how the company’s ambition is to be a major player in the race to build AR glasses. Facebook, Apple, and other tech giants are currently working on their competing devices. Facebook plans to debut its own pair of smart glasses in partnership with RayBan later this year, though they won’t feature AR displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpUuqQ"&gt;According to Spiegel, head-worn devices like these new Spectacles will create a big shift in how we interact with computers. While Snap is betting that millions of people will eventually want to wear Spectacles, the company is content for now to build in public alongside its creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9FQrE"&gt;“You have to invent a whole new way of interacting with computing when it’s volumetric and integrated with the space around you,” Spiegel said. “So I don’t see Snapchat transitioning to wearables that directly, but one of the things that’s really fun is to think about what the new interaction paradigms can look like.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack is having problems, it’s not just you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pueWRGSomJe0poqIhJ3iBDk2g2c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318276/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3VQ0J5"&gt;Slack has been experiencing some frustrating issues for many on Thursday, including some of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. For me, some messages just wouldn’t send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBPY0B"&gt;&lt;a href="https://status.slack.com/2021-05/33aed870657e30a0"&gt;Slack’s status page&lt;/a&gt; says there’s an outage, classifying the problem as people having “trouble loading Slack.” (Slack loads fine for me — it’s just that messages won’t send.) When asked, the company provided this statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="PszotS"&gt;Our teams are aware and are investigating the issue. We know how important it is for people to stay connected and we are working hard to get everyone back up and running. For the latest updates please keep an eye on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slackstatus"&gt;@slackstatus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://status.slack.com/"&gt;status.slack.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1kLHJd"&gt;Slack’s status page first posted that there was an issue at 1:17PM ET. On Twitter, the company also said that users were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1395438954065838085"&gt;having problems sending messages&lt;/a&gt;, like I have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dLkx9H"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Slack is down for some users at the moment, and other users are unable to send messages. We're working hard to get things back up and running, sorry for the disruption! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Adf57Dy1MK"&gt;https://t.co/Adf57Dy1MK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Slack (@SlackHQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1395438954065838085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtTWIW"&gt;As always, I highly recommend cruising Twitter during a Slack outage to see the ridiculous &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NyloAndry/status/1395436475815243782"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swainsch/status/1395436446337703939"&gt;GIFs&lt;/a&gt; that people post. Since Slack’s down, you might not be able to work anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KMvFK"&gt;Slack also went down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213105/slack-outage-down-2021-server-error"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; on the first full work day of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBEvZn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat gets augmented reality Legos you can build with a friend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zpLTPTWVk2iK-lUo9DrRKuKWo8=/158x0:1781x1082/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318239/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_9.31.31_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zQhWLk"&gt;Snapchat is introducing a new type of augmented reality lens, called “Connected Lenses,” which allows Snapchat users to connect and enjoy an AR experience or game together — even if they’re not in the same physical space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehdjnl"&gt;The company is partnering with Lego for its first Connected Lens, which allows users to build a Lego model in augmented reality together, whether that’s in the same room or through the internet from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3eWUwt4SZjBng6BSaAyQ-CWQhwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528419/Screen_Shot_2021_05_20_at_9.30.58_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WMo2N9"&gt;In the demo video that Snap showed off, both users see the same floating Lego model on a table in their respective homes and can add parts, effects, and animations to the model, which are reflected for both users in real time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ST47nH"&gt;The move marks Snap’s latest expansion of augmented reality lenses, which include the popular photo filter lenses, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294062/snapchat-landmarkers-ar-lenses-filters-eiffel-tower-rainbows"&gt;company’s “Landmarker” lenses&lt;/a&gt; for interacting with famous landmarks in AR, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17551428/snapchat-lens-explorer-community-filters"&gt;the community-sourced Lens Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHMRSH"&gt;Creators will also be able to build new Connected Lenses using Snap’s Lens Studio. The new multiperson Lego Lens should be available soon on Lego’s Snapchat profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49LZid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap will launch a standalone iOS video editing app called Story Studio later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ECWt6q7FFJPf0d1Z0j43WzVMX5c=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318136/Story_Studio_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap’s forthcoming iOS app Story Studio will allow people to handle more complicated videos edits from their mobile device. | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CENQ6T"&gt;Snap wants to be the company people think of when they go to edit videos on mobile, so during its annual partnership summit today, the company announced a new iOS app that’ll help it achieve that goal: Story Studio. It’ll give people editing tools specifically designed for mobile, or vertical, videos. The app will pull data from Snapchat and its new Spotlight feature, more familiarly recognized as its TikTok competitor, to help people figure out how and what to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Afq8Kr"&gt;They can look through Snapchat insights, like what’s trending on the app across sounds, hashtags, and lenses. Lenses will be built directly into Story Studio, as well as Snapchat Sounds and stickers, so editors can add those. Of course, like most other video editing apps, users can trim their videos and edit frame by frame. They can then share directly to Snapchat through a built-in button, or download their work to publish in other apps. Notably, content made in Story Studio won’t include a watermark, meaning if it’s published on other platforms, like Instagram’s Reels, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274332/instagram-algorithm-tiktok-watermark-recommendation-software-best-practices"&gt;won’t be demoted&lt;/a&gt; by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9l0wnH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YDx3zJ-3-I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saNyuM"&gt;The app will roll out later this year, and the company didn’t share any other details about a possible Android version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn2pNs"&gt;Additionally today, Snap provided updates on Spotlight. For one, it’s making it easier for video editors to upload content they made in more advanced desktop apps, like Final Cut Pro. Spotlight content can now be uploaded, and watched, through the web at &lt;a href="http://snapchat.com/spotlight"&gt;snapchat.com/spotlight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FHFZDnRdgaXqUH7lX1T8BemNPog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22527733/Spotlight_Web_Upload.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snapchat is making it easier for people to upload Spotlight content. Now they can do so through their desktop computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4EJ0ke"&gt;Finally, Snap also added that it would no longer be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;distributing $1 million per day&lt;/a&gt; to its top Spotlight creators. Instead, starting June 1st, it’ll distribute millions per month and didn’t specify exactly how much. The amount creators receive will be based on the engagement their posts receive, as it is now, and there’s no set limit on the number of people who can get paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzlmSC"&gt;This could be a potentially big deal for the company as it heralds Spotlight as a major success. Some teens &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/style/snapchat-spotlight.html"&gt;became nearly overnight millionaires&lt;/a&gt;, and Snap &lt;a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Snap-Inc.-Q1-2021-Transcript.pdf"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; over 125 million used the feature in March. At the same time, Snap also says more than 500 million people are now monthly active users, which it announced today. It’s possible Spotlight had a hand in this growth, but the number of people logging on might decrease when the promise of a million distributed dollars per day disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14s1qv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC reduces out-of-state prison phone rates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Qg4lsb33xYuaGoVcChD2G2PkE0=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69318064/phone1_1020.1419979655.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;phone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eC5vuf"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously Thursday to lower some of the rates incarcerated people and their families pay to speak over the phone. For jurisdictional reasons, the measure only applies to interstate or international calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKH5vc"&gt;The Commission approved a measure that prohibits companies like Global Tel Link and Pay Tel Communications from charging families and incarcerated people more than 12 cents a minute in large prisons and 14 cents a minute in large jails for out-of-state calls. Previously, rates were capped at 21 cents a minute and single conversations could total several dollars. The action also caps international calling services for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyZXS6"&gt;“Recognizing the exigent circumstances caused by the pandemic, we lower interim interstate rates for prisons and the largest jails,” Acting Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “This means that interstate rates will fall by more than a third for the vast majority of those who are incarcerated. For the first time ever, we cap international rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG2XtL"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/prison-phone-call-cost-martha-wright-v-corrections-corporation-america"&gt;criminal justice advocates have fought&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the exorbitant costs of phone calls in prisons. The FCC attempted to set similar rules lowering costs for &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/337593-court-strikes-down-in-state-prison-call-rates"&gt;intrastate calls in 2017&lt;/a&gt; but was overturned by a DC Circuit ruling. As a result, its current jurisdiction only applies to calls that cross state or national borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6yldd"&gt;A confluence of alleged “monopoly” power and lucrative financial arrangements between prisons and telecom companies are at the root of the expensive phone rates in prisons. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/income.html"&gt;the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of families go into debt due to high phone rates with incarcerated loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpwtDh"&gt;Lawmakers like Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have &lt;a href="https://www.duckworth.senate.gov/news/press-releases/duckworth-portman-booker-schatz-markey-and-king-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-address-predatory-phone-rates-in-criminal-justice-system"&gt;introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; that would provide the FCC more authority to lower in-state prison phone rates, but it’s unclear if the bill will be passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHOqFE"&gt;“There is more we can do. Because as a matter of social justice we are not yet where we need to be,” Rosenworcel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCCWT8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are bidding millions for the first ride on Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ng8ZFq4k7jyuZtRKCuAplhiN5UY=/263x0:3089x1884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317881/BlueOrigin_NS15_06_CapsuleDescent.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mWAE8b"&gt;Rich people are jockeying for a seat on Blue Origin’s first crewed New Shepard mission, bidding as high as $2.8 million for a ten-minute experience at the edge of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YuOvvy"&gt;A single seat aboard the New Shepard crew capsule, dubbed the RSS First Step Crew Capsule, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420709/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-tickets-astronaut"&gt;went up for auction&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, starting with a sealed bidding round that drew “more than 5,200 bidders from 136 countries,” the company said in a statement yesterday. By Wednesday morning, when the auction’s open-bidding phase began, the highest bid was revealed: $1.4 million. It rose to $2.8 million by the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwZhXP"&gt;RSS First Step, a gumdrop-shaped pod with seats for six, is getting set to fly its inaugural crew sometime in the next six months, with one seat reserved for the winning bidder and the rest for company-selected passengers. Proceeds from the auction will go to Blue Origin’s &lt;a href="https://clubforfuture.org/"&gt;philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, Club for the Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XX4GcF"&gt;The company hasn’t revealed the ticket price for a seat — but through the auction, it’s getting a good idea of who the potential customers are and what they’re willing to pay. “Let’s say, the most active bidders, they’re gonna be very clear on our radar, so when we do go to open up those tickets, we’ll know who to go to contact,” Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin’s astronaut sales director, said earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEwq1SgsFyi-4LtymTslfpDlYcw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528283/BlueOrigin_NS15_03_WindowView.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;POV from inside Blue Origin’s suborbital crew capsule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PSiUcn"&gt;After this debut crewed mission in the coming months, more will follow, the company has said. From a desert in Texas, Blue Origin’s reusable 60-foot-tall New Shepard booster will launch the capsule roughly 65 miles into the sky past the Kármán Line, the internationally recognized boundary of Earth’s outermost atmosphere. The trip promises stunning views of Earth and the potential for passengers to experience the “&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/HWHAP/the-overview-effect"&gt;overview effect&lt;/a&gt;,” a feeling described by astronauts as a shift in awareness of Earth when seeing it from space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5IjeC"&gt;You’d need to drop a few stacks for that overview effect, though. The open-bidding phase for New Shepard’s seat closes on June 10th and enters a live, online auction round on Saturday, June 12th. “Participants must raise their bid limit by June 10 at 5 p.m. EDT to participate in the June 12 live auction,” a Blue Origin spokeswoman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HR12a6"&gt;The highest bid price is updated live on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt;. The number increases in increments of 10 percent, according to a person working at RR Auction Company, the Boston, Massachusetts-based firm managing the auction for Blue Origin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymNoUB"&gt;The space company has test flown New Shepard 15 times so far without people on board, with the most recent flight serving as “a verification step for the vehicle and operations prior to flying astronauts.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get ready for a busy Atlantic hurricane season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicaragua Prepares To Receive Hurricane Iota" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6yupZOumAwIVbrsYEMhf6Cr3pY=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317799/1286039153.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;PUERTO CABEZAS, NICARAGUA - NOVEMBER 16: Palm trees blow by wind as Nicaragua prepares to receive hurricane Iota on November 16, 2020 in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Less than two weeks after being hardly affected by Hurricane Eta, villagers of Puerto Cabezas take precautions before landfall of Iota.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Maynor Valenzuela/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aJmiq"&gt;The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be busier than average. There’s a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season this year. Up to 20 named storms and as many as 10 hurricanes are expected, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-another-active-atlantic-hurricane-season"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; published today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They also forecast up to 5 major hurricanes, which have&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;winds reaching 111 mph or higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srh3is"&gt;Hurricane season officially starts on June 1st. But for the first time this year, NOAA began issuing routine Tropical Weather Outlooks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307511/atlantic-hurricane-season-start-two-weeks-early-may"&gt;two weeks early&lt;/a&gt;. More storms have developed ahead of the official&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;season in recent years, to the point where NOAA and the World Meteorological Organization are &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/hurricane-committee-discusses-record-breaking-2020-season-plans-2021"&gt;considering&lt;/a&gt; moving the official start date of the season up to May 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E2VaAo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“New normals” brought on by climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6LF0R"&gt;This all reflects “new normals” brought on by climate change.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Every ten years, using data from weather stations, NOAA &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/new-us-climate-normals-are-here-what-do-they-tell-us-about-climate-change"&gt;updates the 30-year climate record&lt;/a&gt; it uses to determine what’s considered “normal.” Using that data, NOAA recently &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/average-atlantic-hurricane-season-to-reflect-more-storms"&gt;raised the bar&lt;/a&gt; for what’s considered a typical number of storms in a single season. The average is now 14 named storms and seven hurricanes in a season. Prior to that update, an average season had 12 named storms and six hurricanes. The new numbers reflect how much the world has already changed over the past decade, as well as technological advances that help meteorologists better detect storms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JkPik"&gt;“Now is the time to ensure that you have an evacuation plan in place, disaster supplies on hand, and a plan to secure your home quickly,” acting NOAA Administrator Benjamin Friedman said in a press briefing today. “It was a mere six months ago that the most active Atlantic season on record ended, and here we are now on the cusp of a new hurricane season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAwWPQ"&gt;In true 2020 fashion, last year’s Atlantic hurricane season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;was terrible&lt;/a&gt;. Coastal communities reeled under repeated blows — Louisiana faced five named storms while Central America was hard-hit by Hurricanes Eta and Iota in quick succession. A whopping 30 storms grew strong enough to earn a name, and thirteen of those intensified into hurricanes. That was even more than the &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/extremely-active-hurricane-season-possible-for-atlantic-basin"&gt;“extremely active” season NOAA forecasted&lt;/a&gt;. They’d expected more storms because a climate pattern called &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;La Niña&lt;/a&gt; developed, which can lead to more hurricanes in the Atlantic. NOAA said that La Niña could develop again later in the season, although the agency doesn’t expect this year to be as bad as last season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xqcLpF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Those trends raise the risk that these storms pose to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7W5Bq"&gt;The jury is still out on whether climate change makes storms more frequent — but there is &lt;a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/"&gt;evidence that they’re growing stronger&lt;/a&gt;. Hurricanes are also &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/08/climate-change-is-causing-more-rapid-intensification-of-atlantic-hurricanes/?utm_campaign=Climate%20Signals%20Hurricanes&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=96891550&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_LJF2deWCaYUZclLL9HaaH6whOQ6hlphxMGhPyGuzDN_Znd7dxHa6N-XFGWi1P6LJQw-kVwNcIH0ZvnvreeVctQzsoNCcTYqIsUduhDin-2TZmfVU&amp;amp;utm_content=96891550&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;intensifying more rapidly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560182/hurricane-strength-landfall-inland-climate-change-nature-study"&gt;keeping more of their strength&lt;/a&gt; upon making landfall. Those trends raise the risk that these storms pose to people, since they give communities less time to prepare and can reach farther inland. Tropical storms draw their strength from the sea’s heat energy. Hotter global temperatures translate to warmer seas and, consequently, more heat energy for storms to tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTTbZx"&gt;Forecasts made last month by Colorado State University (CSU) and IBM’s The Weather Company also predicted a busy season. &lt;a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html"&gt;CSU expects&lt;/a&gt; 17 named storms while the &lt;a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2021-05-12-atlantic-hurricane-season-outlook-2021-may-twc"&gt;The Weather Company forecast&lt;/a&gt; 19. They both expect eight hurricanes and four major hurricanes to develop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gm1inr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMmDq0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Swift 3X review: not quite swift enough</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Newer, but not quite better&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="csPE8T"&gt;Yep, this is a Swift. It has all the features that characterize Acer’s Swift line: a thin body, a lustrous Acer logo, a chassis so light it’s hard to believe you’re holding a laptop and not an empty shell. But the 3X is targeting a slightly different market from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22256779/acer-swift-5-2021-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Swift 5&lt;/a&gt; for one reason alone: it has a discrete GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8v9L0"&gt;Intel’s new Iris Xe Max, the company’s new discrete graphics card, is making its first appearance in an Acer laptop. With a starting price of &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11552143?sid=VergeAcer3XSwiftReview052021+&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-3x-laptop-sf314-510g-534z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899.99&lt;/a&gt;, the Swift 3X is both one of the lightest and one of the most affordable systems you can buy with discrete graphics. It’s not a system meant for intense gaming, though — the target audience is closer to amateur creators and students who work with photo and video for class. For this specific demographic, the Swift 3X makes sense. For anyone else, the 3X is a bit below its price point in enough other areas that there are likely better options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dLmdMY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10510065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X on a piano, open, facing away from the camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dg4QJqMbxs161kPMxwulA5OrqJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525654/mchin_20190807_4585_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s kinda blue, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8eXk3"&gt;The first thing you might notice about the Swift 3X is its interesting color scheme. The model I tested comes in a new “steam blue” color, which is a nice change from the sea of black and gray laptops that you’ll see in any public setting. There’s a bright blue hinge on the back with “Swift” printed across it as well, which will certainly make the device stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyZHjc"&gt;Weight, though, is the standout feature. The 3X weighs just 3.02 pounds and is 0.71 inches thick. As devices with discrete GPUs go, it’s an unusually portable machine. I brought the 3X on a weekend trip and could slip it into a packed backpack with no problem. It didn’t weigh me down at all. In terms of ports, you get a USB 3.2 Type-C Gen 2 with Thunderbolt 4 and DisplayPort, two USB 3.2 Gen 1, and an HDMI 2.0, as well as a combination audio jack. There’s a fingerprint reader below the arrow keys on the chassis, which worked well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="3BTOzp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10510055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ91jh"&gt;The display is another standout feature. It looks great, with excellent colors and sharp details. What’s nice is that its matte finish, combined with Acer’s ComfyView technology, does a really excellent job of eliminating glare. Using the 3X outdoors was a mixed bag, though — I didn’t see my reflection, but the screen still wasn’t quite bright enough to comfortably use. (It maxed out at 274 nits in our testing — you want at least 300 nits to use a device in very bright settings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHal0L"&gt;That said, build quality is one area where the Swift 3X doesn’t quite measure up to competitors. Most of the chassis is aluminum, but it has a bit of a flimsy and plasticky feel. There’s noticeable flex in the keyboard and screen, which I don’t love to see in laptops over $1,000. And it’ll look like a bit of a clunker next to more expensive fare like Acer’s own Swift 5 — a big reason is that the bezels aren’t tiny (Acer claims an 84 percent screen-to-body ratio) and are visibly plastic. It also feels like a step down from some similarly priced devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus Zenbook 14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iA18EL"&gt;The keyboard and touchpad are functional but not my favorites. They’re a bit shallower and stiffer, respectively, than the best input devices you can find at this price. The touchpad is spacious enough but had significant trouble with palm rejection — my cursor bounced all over the place often while my palm was on the pad, and it sometimes interfered with my typing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hjdIW"&gt;Finally, this isn’t a machine I’d recommend for peripheral-free videoconferencing. While the microphones didn’t have any trouble picking my voice up, the webcam and speakers leave a lot to be desired. The 720p webcam is grainy and didn’t do well in low-light settings. (It doesn’t support Windows Hello facial login, either, though that’s not a crime at this price.) The audio is adequate for Zoom meetings, but I heard some distortion at maximum volume and had to turn the thing down. And I’d recommend an external speaker for anything more. When a friend and I tried to watch a YouTube video on the device, we had to lean in to hear the words clearly. Music has clear vocals, but bass is weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNUZG2"&gt;The Swift comes loaded with DTS Audio Processing, which allows you to swap between presets for music, movies, and games, but there’s no preset for videoconferencing. I actually preferred listening to music on the movie preset, which seemed to have the best balance overall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X open on a piano, seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNPPTcLedwWUY22AI-TEnJD3Qhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525655/mchin_20190807_4585_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lock slot, USB-A, audio jack on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X open on a piano from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upr05O0ugmNx7BTiZMkgcuzqMPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525656/mchin_20190807_4585_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power port, HDMI, USB-A, USB-C on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zjgydv8Yan5IZoB4sQ_cMgKxVvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525657/mchin_20190807_4585_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backlit keyboard and a precision touchpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wj95CK"&gt;These are all compromises you’re making for the Swift 3X’s main attraction, which is its performance. In addition to the Intel graphics, my review unit is powered by Intel’s Core i7-1165G7. This quad-core chip powers many of the best ultraportable laptops on the market and should be capable of doing whatever general office tasks you need to do. It also enables a number of modern amenities, including support for dual-band Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, and Thunderbolt 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv4Vls"&gt;My test configuration, which also includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, costs &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11552143?sid=VergeAcer3XSwiftReview052021++&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.acer.com%2Fen-us%2Fswift-3x-laptop-sf314-510g-767y%3Finternal_source%3Dus.acer.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,199.99&lt;/a&gt;. The $899.99 base model has a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. I imagine that most people in the Swift 3X’s target audience will want the more expensive model (for the extra storage if nothing else) unless they’re on quite a tight budget. But note here that you’re paying a premium for the GPU — an Acer Swift 3 with identical specs to my test model (which is basically this machine without the GPU) costs &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facnxa4kaa004.html&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAcerSwift3XReview052021"&gt;$999.99&lt;/a&gt;, while an Acer Swift 5 (with no GPU, but a step up in build quality and a chassis that’s over half a pound lighter) is just $100 more at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facnxa6saa001.html%3Fsterm%3D3sZzqlTt5xyLUbdwUx0Mo36dUkB2eSUlUWu02E0%26utm_source%3Drflaid68088%26sterm%3DXMv1pEWqFxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2ehw3IyB73U0%26utm_source%3Drflaid914099&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAcerSwift3XReview052021"&gt;$1,299&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rcV3Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I only occasionally heard the fans spin up during my daily work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xeS2fT"&gt;The system does deliver, though. I used the Swift 3X to edit a number of photos with multiple other apps and tasks running in the background, and the device breezed through it without any slowdown or lag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBggj5"&gt;I never felt much heat, even when I was bouncing between over two dozen Chrome tabs — the bottom of the chassis got slightly warm, but that was the extent of it. I only occasionally heard the fans spin up during my daily work. The fold-under hinge creates some extra ventilation space, as do the dual copper heat pipes. You can swap to Performance and Silent fan profiles as well, though I didn’t find the Silent profile necessary given how quiet the Swift was on default settings. I did hear some annoying coil whine on Silent once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVPrrQ"&gt;The Iris Xe Max GPU delivers entry-level graphic performance. The Swift 3X scored a &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38713"&gt;313&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-Premiere-Pro-1519/"&gt;PugetBench&lt;/a&gt; for Premiere Pro, which measures a device’s performance on a number of Premiere Pro tasks. That means it’s a step above integrated graphics — it beats the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=29678"&gt;LG Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=20088"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, with the same RAM and processor, and it trounces both the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=35692"&gt;AMD-powered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=37884"&gt;Intel-powered&lt;/a&gt; Surface Laptop 4. But it doesn’t beat the M1 integrated graphics in &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38019"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s still a step down from midrange Nvidia graphics cards: the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=4693"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; with a GTX 1650 Ti scored well &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=13321"&gt;above a 400&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The lid of the Acer Swift 3X seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWoTvKKZ2NOYIGww5H22o371QFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525658/mchin_20190807_4585_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s Deep Link technology provides better AI performance, per the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qpwPX9"&gt;To get an idea of how these numbers translate to real-world tasks, we ran a five-minute, 33-second 4K video export. When comparing this machine to good ultraportables with Intel integrated graphics, you’re looking at a two- to three-minute improvement in export time with the Xe Max. The Swift 3X completed the task in eight minutes flat; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;Gram 17&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; both took over 10 and a half minutes, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review"&gt;AMD Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt; took 16:33. The Swift 3X was even 15 seconds faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, though the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; finished the task in 7:39. Again, though, the Swift 3X is closer in performance to all of the Intel machines than to anything with a decent GPU — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; took just 4:23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fk00j"&gt;Battery life was also a pleasant surprise, given the discrete GPU. I averaged seven hours and 51 minutes of continuous multitasking at around 200 nits of brightness. That’s comparable to the life span I got from the Swift with the same workload and better than what I got from the cheaper Swift 3. An unfortunately large amount of bloatware also comes preloaded onto this device (ExpressVPN, Norton Security Ultra, other various promotional stuff) so you may see better battery life if you take a few minutes to clean all that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Swift 3X open on a piano seen from the front. The screen displays a blue, green, and white gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgnM6NLbj85thsg6AAe5gvd9-PQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22525659/mchin_20190807_4585_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy it for the GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OAG28t"&gt;The Acer Swift 3X offers more powerful specs than most laptops you’ll be able to find at its price point, with a standout display and battery life, and it manages to do so while being quite light and portable. It’s a step above machines with Intel’s integrated graphics, and a step below anything with a half-decent Nvidia GPU. That’s the clearest case in its favor — and if that sort of laptop is what you’re looking for, you may be uniquely suited to the 3X. The major competitor at this weight and price point I can think of is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-i7-10510U-Innovative-Screenpad-UX434FLC-XH77/dp/B07YZ1MK99?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt;, which can come with an entry-level Nvidia GPU, but the chips in it are a generation old now, so we wouldn’t expect the same performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="022N8a"&gt;With that said, most other aspects of the chassis (the touchpad, the keyboard, the webcam, the speakers, the general build) aren’t quite up to par with other devices you can find at the $1,199 price point. I think you have to really want the GPU. If you don’t, but you’re shopping at this price point and are a fan of the Swift line, the Swift 5 offers better build quality, a thinner and lighter chassis, and a better keyboard and touchpad for just $100 more, with integrated graphics that are still pretty dang good. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acclaimed TimeSplitters franchise set to return under reborn Free Radical studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LiDZBpDNQ_WreH_p8duj2t7wfQE=/40x0:541x334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69317366/new_timesplitters_game_580x334.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cover art from the original &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;released in 2002.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Free Radical Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iv7W3f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters&lt;/em&gt;, the acclaimed PS2-era first-person shooter franchise, is being brought back to life by a newly reformed Free Radical Design, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deepsilver/status/1395238772938264577"&gt;publisher Deep Silver announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Development is set to commence in the coming months after the new studio is built. The studio, which carries the same name as the original &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;developer, will be headed by Steve Ellis and David Doak, who founded Free Radical Design in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMUuJr"&gt;Deep Silver has been laying the groundwork for a new &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;game for several years. It &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deepsilver/status/1029671005097283584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1029671005097283584%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2018%2Fgaming%2Fnews%2Fdeep-silver-acquires-timesplitters-second-sight-1202905883%2F"&gt;acquired the rights to the franchise&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, and in 2019 announced that it was &lt;a href="https://embracer.com/release/thq-nordic-ab-publ-publishes-interim-report-q1-april-june-2019-operational-ebit-increased-193-to-sek-204-million/"&gt;working together with series creator Steve Ellis&lt;/a&gt; to “help plot the future course for this franchise.” But today’s news, that the company is establishing a studio to bring &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;back, is a big commitment that increases the likelihood of a new game actually seeing the light of day. Not like the original &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 4&lt;/em&gt; that was first teased &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-10-10-timesplitters-4-officially-official.html"&gt;way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t2AecE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A new Deep Silver Studio is coming - Free Radical Design &lt;a href="https://t.co/N5qTTcZfsW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/N5qTTcZfsW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Official Deep Silver (@deepsilver) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deepsilver/status/1395238772938264577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O1pOV7"&gt;“To finally be able to confirm that the studio has been formed and that we have a plan for the next &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;game is incredible,” said Free Radical’s Steve Ellis. “While we cannot tell you anything more at the moment, we look forward to sharing information in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7npr1H"&gt;Free Radical’s &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;originally gained attention as a spiritual successor to Rare’s &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye&lt;/em&gt;, the seminal Nintendo 64 shooter. Free Radical’s founders all worked at Rare before starting the new studio. But over time, the &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters &lt;/em&gt;games have become regarded as classics in their own right. Their split-screen modes were especially beloved local multiplayer experiences, and it’s &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Nick Frost’s character Ed can be seen obsessively playing in &lt;em&gt;Shaun of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqpa5c"&gt;Unfortunately, after the release of &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters: Future Perfect&lt;/em&gt; in 2005, Free Radical followed it up with the abysmal PS3-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Haze&lt;/em&gt; in 2008, the last game it would release under its original name. A sequel to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Battlefront II&lt;/em&gt; was also in development at the company between 2006 and 2008 but was canceled by its publisher, reportedly as it neared completion. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; has a great &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-04-free-radical-vs-the-monsters"&gt;feature from 2012&lt;/a&gt; about the events that transpired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0XtLk"&gt;The studio would go on to be purchased and rebranded as Crytek UK, only to be shut down in 2014 and for its staff to &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/07/30/deep-silver-now-owns-homefront-new-studio-handling-development.aspx"&gt;transfer to Dambuster Studios&lt;/a&gt;. In case you’re wondering how a semi-complete port of &lt;em&gt;TimeSplitters 2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-04-12-homefronts-hidden-timesplitters-2-codes-date-back-to-the-original-source"&gt;ended up in Dambuster’s &lt;em&gt;Homefront: The Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, well, this is basically why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CjekwL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
