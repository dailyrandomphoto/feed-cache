    <title>Amazon’s Alexa can now intuitively switch between more languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dwrpMOXyUWq3zgDdop-w7uZ9Yv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68445707/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="43Soz1"&gt;Amazon is updating Alexa to allow it to automatically switch between more languages. The update comes after a flurry of small Alexa additions over the course of November, increasing functionality and making Alexa more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDorYQ"&gt;Alexa first gained the ability to automatically respond to requests &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910086/amazon-alexa-spanish-multilingual-mode"&gt;in English and other languages in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. However, you were limited to only two languages at a time. That hasn’t changed, but now users can enable a few more languages in the Alexa app. Alexa can speak German, French, Canadian-French, Japanese, Spanish, US-Spanish, and Hindi — all paired with English. Additionally, users can switch languages without pulling up the app by saying “Alexa, speak Spanish” to set a new primary language or “Alexa, speak Spanish and English” to set up a pair to switch between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o345Tj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Alexa can anticipate “latent goals”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sfh3rJ"&gt;Alexa has also gained the ability to respond to what Amazon calls “latent goals.” This basically means that Alexa can address requests that are “hidden” within or naturally follow an original question. To borrow Amazon’s example, if you ask “How long does it take to steep tea?” then Alexa can assume that the latent goal is setting a tea timer, respond “Five minutes is a good place to start,” and follow that up with “Would you like me to set a timer for five minutes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WeqP0"&gt;Besides these two major changes, Alexa has gained the ability to include Fire TV commands in Alexa routines. So you can say “Alexa, I’m grabbing a drink,” and Alexa will know to pause your show and turn on your kitchen lights. And to contribute to the ever-growing Alexa creep across products and services, you can now also use the assistant in the Amazon Shopping app to search for products and status updates on orders hands-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJTcqW"&gt;These are just a few of the skill-oriented changes to Alexa that Amazon rolled out in November. Echo devices as a whole have been updated, too. The Echo Frames are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575243/amazon-echo-frames-smart-glasses-alexa-loop-second-gen-available"&gt;now widely available&lt;/a&gt;, the Echo Buds have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21593991/amazon-alexa-echo-buds-workouts-fitness-tracking-wireless-headphones"&gt;new Alexa-enabled workout skills&lt;/a&gt;, and Echo Shows now have access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;Amazon’s Care Hub for checking in on loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQPK5f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zens’ new Modular wireless chargers offer a mix-and-match setup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EV0cRU2oc5XNEaUodWE6fH7QAsg=/276x0:1782x1004/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68444637/Screen_Shot_2020_12_02_at_3.57.31_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zens&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSCSDt"&gt;Zens has a new set of wireless chargers out called &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/blog/zens-introduces-modular-series-create-your-perfect-wireless-charger/"&gt;the Zens Modular&lt;/a&gt;. They are designed to fix the rigidity of most combination wireless chargers by letting users customize their own bespoke charging setup to suit their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTbchn"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/modular-series/"&gt;Zens Modular system&lt;/a&gt; is divided into two halves: main stations and extensions. The main station (as the name implies) is the primary hub for your wireless charging setup and is the only thing that you’ll have to plug into the wall. Zens has three different main station options: the €99,99 / $121.16 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/zens-modular-dual-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Dual Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, which is a flat pad that can charge two devices at once at up to 15W each; the €69,99 / $84.81 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-stand-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Stand Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a single charger that offers a stand form factor and can charge at 15W; and the €59,99 / $72.69 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-single-wireless-charger-main-station/"&gt;Modular Single Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt;, a standard flat pad that also offers 15W charging. All three products are rated for both Apple’s 7.5W charging and Samsung Fast Charge, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xGOY8"&gt;But while the main station hubs are relatively standard wireless chargers, it’s the Modular system’s extension hubs that make things interesting. Using a magnetic connector, you can clip on additional charging pads to a main charger, adding multiple Apple Watch or wireless charging pads as you need (up to four total). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mS3BNGHhwWo5SKbqBIzGG81ycr0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138450/zens.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zens&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lIzaOq"&gt;To start, Zens is offering two extensions: a €39,99 / $48.46 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-single-wireless-charger-extension/"&gt;Modular Single Wireless Charger Extension&lt;/a&gt; block that adds a 10W charging pad and a €49,99 / $60.57 &lt;a href="https://makezens.com/shop/modular-apple-watch-charger-extension/"&gt;Apple Watch module&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s smartwatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55EhhZ"&gt;There are a few limitations: only those two extension pads can be used as add-ons (so you can’t chain together multiple stand chargers or multiple double pads). The new chargers also don’t use the multi-coil technology that Zens debuted with its excellent Liberty charger earlier this year, so you’ll still need to make sure you’re aligning your phone correctly. The Zens chargers are also pretty pricey for what they offer, but the customizable system and sheer number of devices you can charge off a single plug might make it worthwhile for customers who want to be able to charge up multiple devices frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ad5h2P"&gt;The new Zens Modular chargers are available now through the company’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeSkbg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xkts7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8XELa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Living the full Cyberpunk 2077 lifestyle will cost you over $2,000 and your dignity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VRndrtmITpI4hmn24HZtSnzzWvQ=/392x0:2486x1396/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68436226/Screen_Shot_2019_06_09_at_4.22.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5m7HvN"&gt;We are eight days away from the release of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJWBYKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but with all of the brand tie-ins for the upcoming roleplaying game, you could mistakenly think it was already out. Throughout the year, developer CD Projekt Red has teamed up with multiple companies to create a slew of cyberpunk-themed items from gaming mice to game controllers and, yes, even energy drinks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xyH1RJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rhW7dF"&gt;The target audience: people who love both the color yellow and dystopian motifs so much that they’d be willing to look at them, wear them, and even drink them at all times. The good news for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; fans is there are plenty of ways to show off your fandom, from the official CDPR &lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/samurai-varsity-jacket-male.html"&gt;“samurai” varsity jacket&lt;/a&gt; to the profoundly hideous &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;-themed Secretlab Omega gaming chair. The bad news is it’s all inexplicably expensive — and, oh yeah, a bit hideous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geG8PC"&gt;A lot of these collaborations are very on-brand, I must say. They all have a futuristic vibe that could appeal to the right kind of fan steeped in &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner &lt;/em&gt;vibes and synthwave aesthetics — although I personally find all this stuff quite ugly. But it’s certainly not beyond the pale when it comes to video game marketing, and I’m sure there are plenty of people out there excited enough for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; to come out (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt;) that they want to go all in on celebrating the launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVrB8o"&gt;So I found all of the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; brand tie-ins I could because I was curious to know how much it would cost to be a &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; cyberpunk&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In short, it will cost a pretty penny — especially considering most of this stuff is either out of stock, discontinued entirely, or limited units were made. (I am looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225642/microsoft-xbox-one-x-cyberpunk-2077-limited-edition-bundle-console-controller"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; limited-edition Xbox One X bundle&lt;/a&gt;.) Either way, here are a few brand tie-ins if you want to show your love for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bf2jLd"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giztop.com%2Foneplus-8t-cyberpunk.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 8T Cyberpunk Edition&lt;/a&gt; ($849)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIm6POhP6g9mSdSLwVVZattZ-uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22007791/a7c1c366gy1gkb7gekgouj24mo334nph.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/3871046669" target="_blank"&gt;via Weibo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4XimQp"&gt;One of the more expensive brand tie-ins, the OnePlus 8T is a good phone with a 120Hz screen and surprisingly fast charging. The entire &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; theme is neat, and there is a subtle touch of striking yellow accents that make the design look interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9mDoUB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series#titan_2020-cyberpunk_2077"&gt;SecretLab Titan gaming chair — &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;($489)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SveDJmQSW-BSchpDVFn26OPhcUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137793/secret_lab_omega.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SecretLab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the chair would have been much cooler if the design on the back was on the front.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JN36dm"&gt;SecretLab chairs are pretty comfy (but very expensive). Still, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Though, to be honest, I think the majority yellow design makes this chair a bit off-putting and can really stick out like a sore thumb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TnKRM6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-x-cyberpunk-2077-limited-edition-bundle-1tb%2F11102016.html%3Futm_source%3Drakutenls%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3DFuture%2BPublishing%2BLtd%26utm_campaign%3D10%26utm_kxconfid%3Dtebx5rmj3%26cid%3Dafl_10000087%26affID%3D77777%26sourceID%3DkXQk6.ivFEQ-vZCh56J_OlmR9s7EN4JB8A" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Limited edition Cyberpunk 2077 Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; ($400)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HCl_bZ5bVXhokKbXaClMXLsLuJE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19909360/CATVi0v.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xbox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not the worst limited edition console design I’ve seen. I mean, at least it’s not just a big yellow block.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6sZ6kW"&gt;This is actually one of the cooler limited edition &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; items. At the time it was produced, there were 45,000 units, so this is certainly a rare find for its initial retail price. But that includes glow-in-the-dark accents, laser etching, and custom panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KkePAB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2FRazer-Viper-Ultimate%2FRZ01-03050500-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Razer Viper Ultimate with Charging Dock — Cyberpunk 2077 Edition&lt;/a&gt; ($160) &lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The entire design is a huge no for me. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKYA9VO5qOZN07sC6T4Ro_gpYjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137754/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h4b_h80_9099485577246_cyberpunk_2077_viper_ultimate_1500x1000_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FnlOGM"&gt;Honestly, in the right context, you could tell me this was a car featured in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; and I probably would believe you. To be fair, the Razer Viper Ultimate is a good gaming mouse with an ambidextrous design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Yos1hn"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2FRazer-Viper-Ultimate%2FRZ01-03050500-R3M1%3Firclickid%3DW96TxQ2%3ArxyLTKb0EHQlB1XYUkEw8QTeIyB73U0%26irgwc%3D1%26utm_term%3DVox%2520Media#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Gigantus V2 XXL mousepad/phone case&lt;/a&gt; ($40 - $50)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GuQsaoAaab_gkPiUJyAmBS8Nd4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138209/cp2077_customs_mobile.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well these are interesting to the say the least.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bnOdK5"&gt;Oh, and let’s not forget the mouse pad. Yes, you can also buy a Razer mouse pad with a matching phone case for Apple and Samsung phones. This XXL mousepad will look very nice if you’re committed to the whole &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic on your PC gaming desk. For $40, you can get this &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcustoms%2Fpersonalize%2Fview%2Fcyberpunk-2077%2Fall%2Fmouse-mats%2Frazer-gigantus-v2-xxl&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;obnoxious yellow mouse pad with the game’s logo&lt;/a&gt; printed in the center or the classier &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcustoms%2Fpersonalize%2Fview%2Fcyberpunk-2077%2Fall%2Fmouse-mats%2Frazer-gigantus-v2-xxl&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;samurai skull over a black background&lt;/a&gt;. (I vote for the latter.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cDqIp"&gt;I am not sure why there are phone cases. Okay, jokes aside: I kind of like the phone cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0olQGL"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Faccessories%2Fmobile%2Fproducts%2Farctis-1-cyberpunk-2077-netrunner-edition-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-4%2F214147.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhptsgEUF85DdiJ-97XuNzLZ0qwa1hPzp8lpwXgh9nmSy90BBmE6N3goaAtEeEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SteelSeries Arctis 1 Cyberpunk 2077 Netrunner Edition&lt;/a&gt; ($110)&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNBpRinSZRSc1rSMuAVs9eX4A6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22138151/steelseries_cyberpunk_gaming_headset.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SteelSeries&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBVQ72"&gt;If you’re going to deck out your entire PC gaming setup with &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; as the main theme, you’ll need to buy &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Faccessories%2Fmobile%2Fproducts%2Farctis-1-cyberpunk-2077-netrunner-edition-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-4%2F214147.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQiAk53-BRD0ARIsAJuNhptsgEUF85DdiJ-97XuNzLZ0qwa1hPzp8lpwXgh9nmSy90BBmE6N3goaAtEeEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a reliable gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;. This headset would also work with a PS4, Switch, or Android but would also pair nicely with the Razer Viper gaming mouse I mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea8U0V"&gt;Also, I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; show you a &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; gaming keyboard. Unfortunately, the only thing I could find that existed in the similar realm of these other brand tie-ins was a Whirlwind FX mechanical keyboard, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwhirlwindfx%2Fstatus%2F1280221958521516032&amp;amp;psig=AOvVaw1wiESc8VAP_LWN3pWn7Xe3&amp;amp;ust=1607026423868000&amp;amp;source=images&amp;amp;cd=vfe&amp;amp;ved=0CA0QjhxqFwoTCLCI4YuOsO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN"&gt;it was only a giveaway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A1W4N5"&gt;I like varsity jackets. (I was a two-sport athlete in high school and a former division 1 athlete, thanks for asking.) Aside from being good winter jackets, they are also very expensive. Also, why is there (usually) only one letter on them? Well, now you can buy this &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;-themed jacket, which has &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; (count them) letters printed plus a cool samurai skull on the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FHML"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/cyberpunk-2077-backpack-by-doughnut.html"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 Backpack&lt;/a&gt; ($112)&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am very surprised this is not a banana yellow backpack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DD78Y7"&gt;Keeping with the “back to school” vibe, here’s a &lt;a href="https://us.gear.cdprojektred.com/cyberpunk-2077-backpack-by-doughnut.html"&gt;$112 backpack&lt;/a&gt; that also has &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. Looks like a very spacious backpack; wonder how many &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; gaming mice could I put in here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HKq9rU"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WINTERSUNNY-Cyberpunk-Filters-Adjustable-Elastic/dp/B08NJXX53L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Cyberpunk+2077&amp;amp;qid=1606940413&amp;amp;s=apparel&amp;amp;sr=1-101&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=700923852f1b0c1e46ad75c7d84fcef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 Face Mask&lt;/a&gt; ($13)&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yes, you can even show your &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; love through a face mask.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Us5xXs"&gt;If you can, stay inside as much as possible. But if you do decide to go outside, remember to wear your face mask. If you really want people to know you like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WINTERSUNNY-Cyberpunk-Filters-Adjustable-Elastic/dp/B08NJXX53L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Cyberpunk+2077&amp;amp;qid=1606940413&amp;amp;s=apparel&amp;amp;sr=1-101&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=700923852f1b0c1e46ad75c7d84fcef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$13 cover you can wear on your face&lt;/a&gt; while you do. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rockstar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotta unlock all these digital rewards sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lmp4uc"&gt;Certain Rockstar Energy drink cans have &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; printed, and if you go to the Rockstar Energy drink website to enter the code on your can, you can use it to unlock digital rewards and entries for other prizes like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; swag, or if you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lucky a &lt;a href="https://2077.rockstarenergy.com/static/rewards-car@1x-0ea44a3f8550b9de62ed35fcbb1dd4ff.png"&gt;1970 Custom Mustang&lt;/a&gt;. To increase your chances of winning, just &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRockstar-Original-Energy-Drink-16-fl-oz-12-Cans%2F383588927&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get yourself a 12-pack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neAEuT"&gt;Of course, there’s other &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;-themed merch you could add, too, but we’ve already got the essentials — and if we tally up how much all this would cost, it would set you back roughly $2,294. That’s &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of money — but hey, if you like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; that much, who am I to judge?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Put Baby Yoda on your wrist with Vodafone and Disney’s Neo smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMPc4e_rqCPanLh6k1-Bc6sIAIA=/141x0:831x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68427783/Tablet_L_460x1844_TheChild.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vodafone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S11oSF"&gt;European mobile carrier Vodafone has partnered with Disney to launch a new wearable for kids called &lt;a href="https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/vodafone-unveils-neo-the-game-changing-smart-watch-designed-for-kids-and-featuring-iconic-characters-from-disney-pixar-marvel-and-star-wars/"&gt;the Neo&lt;/a&gt;. Vodafone says the Neo combines its technological capabilities with Disney’s entertainment chops to offer a wearable that gives kids a sense of independence while letting parents stay in contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUL28t"&gt;The Neo’s most notable feature is its Disney branding. The Yves Béhar-designed watch lets kids choose from a collection of “Sidekicks” that will hang out on the main clock screen, including The Child / Baby Yoda / Grogu from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;, Buzz Lightyear from &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;, and Minnie Mouse. Vodafone says the Sidekicks will animate throughout the day, and the company plans to add more characters over time at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgVeLJ8M96k5GiI0TNnLACTmlzk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137589/1300x910_uk.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vodafone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the Neo smartwatch with the Vodafone Smart app for controlling privacy settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MgtV38"&gt;Besides the injection of Disney charm, the Neo is mostly focused on keeping parents in touch with their kids, with a few added smartwatch features (though all of this requires a Vodafone subscription). With the watch, parents can call, text, and get updates on their kid’s location from the companion Vodafone Smart app. Parents can use the same app to create a “circle” of trusted contacts for texting and calling and limit screen time with Quiet Mode. To boost kid’s “independence,” the Neo can also receive calendar updates, check the weather, track activity, and take photos with a built-in 5-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F012Ev"&gt;Wearables for kids are not a new category, and plenty of other mobile carriers like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsmart-watch%2Ftimex-familyconnect%3Fsku%3D610214661166&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fconnected-smartwatches%2Fverizon-gizmowatch-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F22056770%2Fdisney-vodafone-neo-smartwatch-children-yves-behar-star-wars-baby-yoda#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; offer takes on the idea. Even Apple has gotten into the game with Family Setup in watchOS 7, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21518711/apple-watch-family-setup-test-review-features-explainer"&gt;we looked at earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The problems with smartwatches for kids are twofold: parents have to decide how much of their child’s privacy they’re willing to sacrifice to keep them safe, and usually, these watches aren’t very great in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqWeov"&gt;Vodafone says the Neo won’t be released in Europe until early 2021, where it should retail for £99 with £7-a-month subscription. If the Neo’s specific Disney wrapper piques your family’s interest, you can &lt;a href="https://eshop.v.vodafone.com/uk/neo-smart-kids-watch"&gt;sign up for the waitlist today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Massachusetts on the verge of becoming first state to ban police use of facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5hGYXzqYEPnuFqGLR7TNh5-vcI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68426471/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmNbEl"&gt;Massachusetts lawmakers this week voted to ban the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and public agencies in a sweeping police reform bill that received significant bipartisan support. If signed into law, Massachusetts would become the first state to fully ban the technology, following bans barring the &lt;a href="https://securitytoday.com/articles/2019/10/10/california-to-become-third-state-to-ban-facial-recognition-software-in-police-body-cameras.aspx"&gt;use of facial recognition in police body cameras&lt;/a&gt; and other, more limited city-specific bans on the tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQhBsY"&gt;The bill, &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963?=11302020"&gt;S.2963&lt;/a&gt;, marks yet another state government tackling the thorny ethical issue of unregulated facial recognition use in the absence of any federal guidance from Congress. It also includes bans on chokeholds and rubber bullets in addition to restrictions on tear gas and other crowd-control weapons, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It isn’t a blanket ban on facial recognition; police will still be able to run searches against the state’s driver’s license database but only with a warrant and requirements that law enforcement agencies publish annual transparency reports regarding those searches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGzTYZ"&gt;Massachusetts joins cities like Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon, as well as San Francisco and Oakland in Northern California, that have banned police use of facial recognition. Earlier this year, Boston became the first major East Coast city to &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/23/boston-facial-recognition-ban"&gt;bar police from purchasing and using facial recognition services&lt;/a&gt;, but the Massachusetts bill goes a step further in making the ban statewide. S.2963 passed 28-12 in the state senate and 92-67 in the Massachusetts House of Representatives on Tuesday, and it now awaits signing from Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="54wMrl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Massachusetts’ bill institutes a statewide ban on police use of facial recognition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1NNic"&gt;Use of facial recognition has become a controversial topic in the artificial intelligence industry and the broader tech policy sphere because of a lack of federal guidance regulating its use. That vacuum has allowed a number of companies — most prominently controversial firm Clearview AI — to step in and offer services to governments, law enforcement agencies, private companies, and even individuals, often without any oversight or records as to how it’s used and whether it’s even accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfb1du"&gt;In August, Clearview AI — which has sold access to its software and its database of billions of images, scraped in part from social media sites to numerous government agencies and private companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;signed a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. (In May, Clearview said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stop selling its tech to private companies&lt;/a&gt; following a lawsuit brought against it for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which, prior to these more recent city bans, was the only piece of US legislation regulating facial regulation use.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYRA3e"&gt;A number of researchers have been sounding the alarm for years now that modern facial recognition, even when aided by advanced AI, can be flawed. Systems like Rekognition have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197137/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-bias-race-gender"&gt;have issues identifying the gender of darker-skinned individuals&lt;/a&gt; and suffer from other racial bias built into how the databases are constructed and how the models are trained on that data. Amazon in June &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;banned police from using its facial recognition platform for one year&lt;/a&gt;, with the company saying it wants to give Congress “enough time to implement appropriate rules” governing the sale and use of the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZjfMg"&gt;Amazon was following the lead of IBM, which announced that same month it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software"&gt;no longer develop the technology whatsoever&lt;/a&gt; after acknowledging criticism from researchers and activists over its potential use in racial profiling, mass surveillance, and other civil rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>God of War’s Kratos is coming to battle his way through the Fortnite universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvBJkxsNTcbb5IuHxx_TD0c8PEY=/116x0:1336x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68426194/EoQSbyPXEAMV1ze.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VJGq3B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to tie-ins — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;the battle royale’s season 5 battle pass&lt;/a&gt; has already kicked off with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;picture-perfect Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt; and Baby Yoda skin, for example — but its next character appears to be coming not from a popular film or movie franchise, but from a different video game universe: &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s Kratos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFGcH7"&gt;The image, first posted by noted leaker HYPEX on Twitter, depicted a version of the Ghost of Sparta (in his more recent, bearded form from 2018’s &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;), albeit with a softer animated style look that’s more in line with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s art style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IKTHpf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Kratos will be a skin soon! (Reposted for a better image) &lt;a href="https://t.co/S6lgYMcGJR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/S6lgYMcGJR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— HYPEX (@HYPEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1334211805422505984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FA6B1b"&gt;Another tease from the PlayStation account further hints at Kratos’ pending arrival, with an unseen character panicking about “the next guy you’re picking up has literally vanquished multiple gods with his bare hands in a fit of uncontrollable rage” — a description that matches Kratos to a T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ZupV3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Incoming audio transmission from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FortniteGame&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/SdpmU7OmkM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SdpmU7OmkM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1334210728602054658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ngxWt"&gt;The current season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHsdYu8RRSI"&gt;features multiple “hunters”&lt;/a&gt; from different realities that have been brought to the island in the wake of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;universe-shattering fight with Galactus&lt;/a&gt;. In that vein, Kratos seems to fit right in. That said, as one of Sony’s marquee first-party characters, it is a little jarring to see that Kratos will be joining a third-party game that exists on nearly every gaming platform like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46ERbN"&gt;It’s not clear yet when the Kratos skin will be available, if it’ll be something that players will have to purchase or can earn in-game, or even if it’ll be available to players on platforms other than the PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5. But with Sony’s official account already teasing the character, we likely won’t have long to wait before a more formal announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s Watch Party feature is now available to all subscribers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fJUXD2sBHE7TBjOkcmsFyDZQzQc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68418404/Happiest_Season_Hulu_Watch_Party.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbCyze"&gt;Hulu was first among the major streaming services to roll out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273246/hulu-watch-party-feature-how-to-use-test"&gt;a way for multiple people to watch its shows and movies together&lt;/a&gt; at the same time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, that Watch Party feature is expanding to all subscribers — not just those people paying for the ad-free plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZdBe6"&gt;Watch Party is available on Hulu’s website. You’ll see the icon on a title’s details page. From there, you can share a Watch Party link with up to seven other Hulu subscribers so that everyone can watch the same content together from afar. Hulu says that “while watching, group members will be able to react in real-time through the chat function and control their own playback.” If you find yourself having to pause while your friends keep watching, there’s a “click to catch up” button to get right back to the same spot as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9q7hu"&gt;You can use Watch Party with “thousands” of titles from Hulu’s on-demand library, including the company’s new original rom-com film &lt;em&gt;The Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;, which Hulu says broke streaming records when it premiered over Thanksgiving weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6H0LK"&gt;A number of third-party co-watch apps rose in popularity during the early quarantine phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21307519/amazon-watch-party-prime-video-virtual-parties-streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-scener-twitch"&gt;Amazon Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432411/disney-plus-watch-party-feature-test-canada-scener-netflix-amazon-prime-video"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345413/movies-anywhere-viewing-party-feature-watch-together-screen-pass-lending-app"&gt;Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452744/sling-tv-watch-party-live-tv-beta-chrome-available-now"&gt;Sling TV&lt;/a&gt; have begun offering their own built-in solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI’s FPV racing drone looks mighty real in these leaked photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I0iZweah5aZ_iRxJ6E5t9-LU--Q=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68410986/dji_fpv_combo_leak.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6bfnXq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8932222/dji-fpv-racing-drone-rumor-fcc-filings"&gt;For a brief moment last July&lt;/a&gt;, it seemed like drone maker DJI was going to dive straight into drone racing with a speedy FPV (first-person-view) drone of its own. In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747609/dji-new-fpv-goggles-camera-drone-racing-filming-hd-high-definition-kit-price"&gt;it merely dipped a toe&lt;/a&gt; — but a little over a year later, it looks like the company is nearly ready to announce a racing drone after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rzzgm"&gt;You’re now looking at leaked images of what appears to be called the “DJI FPV,” and it certainly doesn’t look like any drone the company’s released before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qqJiOt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like spaceship!&lt;br&gt;Someone who got evaluation didn't keep their NDA. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qyFycphly6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qyFycphly6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1334084415694073856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="k2EBNt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Overlord, this is FPV 1, requesting take off.&lt;br&gt;FPV 1 you are cleared to take off, please proceed to helipad one.&lt;br&gt;Solid copy Overlord, FPV 1 taking off at helipad one.&lt;br&gt;FPV 1, you have the sky, have nice trip, over and out.&lt;br&gt;Copy that, FPV 1 out. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GTw6A2w4mR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GTw6A2w4mR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1334176526586187778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="lalfT7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;5.8GHz &amp;amp; 915MHz ready, I think this is it. Rumor says some resellers have got the evaluation model of FPV Drone, with remote-adjustable FPV camera. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yVUKS96q99"&gt;https://t.co/yVUKS96q99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OsitaLV (@OsitaLV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1329297607789666304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BH5JU"&gt;Without any hard specs or even the barest idea of price, it’s tough to judge what we’re looking at, but the three-blade propellers, sizable hump, and minimalist controller are all a departure from the company’s many previous drones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIcsB3"&gt;That makes sense, since FPV racing and filming focuses on speed over all else. You’ll generally tilt your entire drone far beyond the angle you’d tilt a traditional filmmaking drone to maximize your forward momentum — and when you do, you need a camera that primarily tilts up, not down. And if you’re going to be wearing an FPV headset all the time (it appears to come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747609/dji-new-fpv-goggles-camera-drone-racing-filming-hd-high-definition-kit-price"&gt;the DJI FPV Goggles&lt;/a&gt;), you don’t really need a holder for your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu2pf9"&gt;These leaks all come by way of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV"&gt;OsitaLV on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/02/dji-fpv-drone-leaks-in-latest-images-release-near/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), who has a reputation for finding out DJI’s news before it’s official. Most recently, OsitaLV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OsitaLV/status/1317291858251350017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;shared images and details&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21524505/dji-osmo-pocket-2-price-release-date-features-4k-video-gimbal"&gt;DJI Pocket 2&lt;/a&gt; four days before it was announced. They also recently shared an image &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/11/24/leaked-photo-mavic-pro-3/"&gt;of a possible Mavic Pro 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMQMY1"&gt;Early last month, DJI’s Brendan Schulman teased that the company might still have another product announcement this year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPjCMl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;DJI released six new products in the past three weeks. Surely, everyone feels we must be done for the year. &lt;a href="https://t.co/e9xet6LheP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/e9xet6LheP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brendan Schulman (@dronelaws) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dronelaws/status/1324492559863996416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zP1YrL"&gt;Perhaps this is it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reportedly will sell its flying taxi business to secretive startup Joby Aviation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1CnwT2qnlVzkZgx6bm1VaoeJ_8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68409894/ECRM003_hero_shot__1___1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="66QegU"&gt;Uber’s ambitious and quixotic effort to launch a flying taxi service is coming in for a landing. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-190158b9-9753-4f6d-a857-39f93af93222.html"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ride-hailing company has agreed to sell its Uber Elevate division to secretive startup Joby Aviation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKMiEp"&gt;The news comes as Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi attempts to push his company closer to profitability, which includes the sale of the money-losing parts of the business. The company is also said to be exploring the sale of its autonomous vehicle division. A spokesperson for Uber declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QVLhG"&gt;Uber first announced its interest in launching a network of electric flying taxis in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13434580/uber-flying-car-elevate-self-driving-vtol"&gt;a white paper published in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Under Uber’s calculations, a two-hour, 12-minute slog from San Francisco to San Jose would become a breezy 15 minutes by flying car. A two-hour, 10-minute battle through São Paulo gridlock would be transformed into an 18-minute pleasure ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4XKWkK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber first announced its interest in launching a network of electric flying taxis in a white paper published in 2016&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50s2RI"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655126/uber-copter-new-york-city-jfk-airport-elevate-helicopter-flying-taxi-price"&gt;Uber starting offering helicopter trips&lt;/a&gt; from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The trips were meant to offer a taste of what the experience would be like to use the Uber app to summon a flight rather than a car ride, and the company certainly saw it as an opportunity to gather data for its air taxi plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oa1s2A"&gt;Those plans were ambitious, and perhaps doomed, from the start. It relied on a technology — electric-powered aviation — that was still under development and had yet to be tested as part of a commercial service. And it would have been costly to implement, requiring the construction of a vast network of rooftop or ground-level “skyports” and regulatory approval from a host of federal, state, and local agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgnKkZ"&gt;The choice of Joby Aviation as buyer makes sense. In December 2019, the ride-hailing company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029943/uber-joby-aviation-flying-car-air-taxi-2023"&gt;join forces with the Northern California-based aerospace company&lt;/a&gt;, which has been working on electric aircraft for over a decade. Joby was the first company to commit to Uber’s aggressive timetable to launch a flying taxi service by 2023. A spokesperson for Joby declined to comment as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UteFAA"&gt;Joby is the brainchild of inventor JoeBen Bevirt, who started the company in 2009 and operated it in relative obscurity until 2018, when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959698/joby-aviation-evtol-100-million-investment"&gt;Joby announced&lt;/a&gt; it had raised a surprising $100 million from a variety of investors, including the venture capital arms of Intel, Toyota, and JetBlue. The money helped finance the development of the company’s air taxi prototype, which has been conducting test flights at Joby’s private airfield in Northern California. Bevirt helps run an incubator outside of Santa Cruz that’s been described as a &lt;a href="https://pando.com/2013/07/03/the-startup-ranch-of-santa-cruz/"&gt;quasi-commune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDzeEe"&gt;Unlike the dozens of other companies that are currently building electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Joby has kept much of its project under wraps. The few renderings that are out there show a plane-drone hybrid with 12 rotors and room in the cabin for four passengers, though a spokesperson previously cautioned that what Joby is working on now is “entirely new.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqOzDF"&gt;The company lifted the curtain in January 2020, when it announced it had closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;massive $590 million round of venture capital funding&lt;/a&gt;. Joby also announced that it was teaming up with previous investor Toyota to launch an air taxi service using its new aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNTaE7"&gt;The all-electric aircraft has six rotors and seats five, including the pilot. It can take off vertically, like a helicopter, and then shift into forward flight using tilt rotors. Joby says it can reach a top speed of 200 mph, travel 150 miles on a single charge, and is 100 times quieter than a conventional aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFrwdA"&gt;Of course, many companies — Joby included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal figh&lt;/a&gt;t with its former investor, Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggbpN3"&gt;The jury is still out on whether an electric vertical takeoff and landing-based air taxi system would make an appreciable contribution to a next-generation transportation system, or whether it would simply be an escape hatch for the super-rich to avoid street-level traffic congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEdmCp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Galaxy Buds Pro image reveals new rounded design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgCgNHVtNnOgxTnlkTS6TNO0u8I=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68388280/galaxy_buds_pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKdq2P"&gt;An image of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds has leaked, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1"&gt;noted leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nokmco"&gt;You can see the apparent image of the headphones at the top of this post. They look to have a more rounded shape than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an image of what the Galaxy Buds Plus look like, for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tn-fX96eR_5b9lex_3JWl0-94hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137433/DSCF5554.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cBqOZS"&gt;Blass also posted a render that apparently shows the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro — a render looks similar to a diagram of the case found in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726569/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-fcc-regulatory-filing"&gt;recent FCC filings&lt;/a&gt; for the Galaxy Buds Pro. Instead of the more oblong shape of the case for the Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds Plus, the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro looks to be more of a square with rounded corners, like the one for Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1H4VtYBYsCT_Qjcz703vZDiND9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137401/b63d057b303988a415aa6c765760bb5a137c30e78c3292c4b5e5f9a1c0167de5.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the Galaxy Buds Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SsuHss"&gt;A new shape and new case aren’t the only new updates reportedly coming to the Galaxy Buds Pro — they may also have active noise cancellation and improvements to ambient mode, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-buds-with-galaxy-s21-details/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to be revealed alongside the Galaxy S21 phones in January, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
