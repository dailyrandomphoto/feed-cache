  &lt;p id="NuFtNt"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our chat show to discuss this week in tech news featuring our reporters and editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9YXSA"&gt;This week, Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn start off the show with &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9534646/square-tidal-acquisition-majority-stake-jay-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Micah Singleton&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the news of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s Square, Inc. buying a majority stake in Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal&lt;/a&gt;. Micah analyzes why this deal took place, what this means for Tidal, and how this may change the way artists are paid for their music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99pK1W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior editor Tom Warren also joins the show to expand on the announcement of Microsoft’s Mesh mixed reality platform and how it may be the “virtual future” of Microsoft Team meetings. Tom also details the long list of Microsoft announcements from this week, including various updates to Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get a refurbished Oculus Quest with a one-year warranty for under $200 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhfnIn8NET3xpLU_CwlIdoqxAo4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916907/akrales_190429_3371_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3nFLM"&gt;Oculus released its first-generation Quest VR headset in 2019, and it quickly became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21266152/oculus-quest-one-year-review-best-vr-headset-pc"&gt;sought-after head-mounted display&lt;/a&gt;, if you were looking to play virtual reality games without being tethered to a gaming PC. But the original model has been hard to find since it was discontinued last year with the release of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21427947/oculus-quest-2-facebook-vr-headset-price-release-date-preorder-connect"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkzoEo"&gt;Despite this, the original Oculus Quest model is still a good VR headset to buy. You can get &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the original model refurbished for $199 at Oculus’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes 64GB of storage and a one-year warranty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULRqVI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10375901"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gEHFbh"&gt;Samsung released the Samsung Galaxy S21 line in January, but we have already seen this line of smartphones discounted. You can save up to $250 on either an unlocked S21, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Pro-Grade-SM-G991UZAEXAA/dp/B08N361Y2D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614292-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_g996uzkaxaa_s21_128gb_5g_smartphone.html#donotlink"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734044033433455040" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734046442342580972" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEYbV2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Pro-Grade-SM-G991UZAEXAA/dp/B08N361Y2D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; sale price starts at $700. The &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614294-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_g996uzsaxaa_s21_128gb_5g_smartphone.html#donotlink"&gt;S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt; starting sale price is $800 for a 128GB model, and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731732833335026196" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;’s sale price starts at $1,000 for the 128GB model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cazwlt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bdfnqY"&gt;Of course, if you need a new smartphone but don’t want to spend a ton of money, B&amp;amp;H is selling an &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html#donotlink"&gt;unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL with 64GB for $280&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this phone being almost three years old, it does come with the latest Android 11 OS and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;will support Android 12 &lt;/a&gt;when it launches later this year. But be aware: this phone will stop receiving updates after October 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ewuOpN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DBaEOJ"&gt;Last November, Microsoft released two next-generation Xbox consoles: the $500 Xbox Series X console, which is the company’s most powerful gaming hardware to date, and the less powerful, more affordable Xbox Series S, which also lacks a disc drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGSPtT"&gt;If the $300 Xbox Series S console is the one you’re looking for, it’s a lot easier to buy compared to the other next-gen gaming consoles released around the same time. &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.costco.com%2Fxbox-series-s-with-additional-controller.product.100699182.html"&gt;Costco is currently selling a bundle on the Series S&lt;/a&gt; that is not price surged. For $340, you get the console plus an additional controller, which is a good deal as the price for &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-wireless-controller%23white" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; is usually $60. Keep in mind that a membership is required for Costco. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tom Cruise deepfake creator says public shouldn’t be worried about ‘one-click fakes’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9k7x6gwEcCcWvnXLupev5IW6uI=/154x0:1287x755/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916810/tom_cruise_deepfake_before_after.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to see a magic trick? Tom Cruise impersonator Miles Fisher (left) and the deepfake Tom Cruise created by Chris Ume (right). &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Chris Ume&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="413rNb"&gt;When a series of spookily convincing Tom Cruise deepfakes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303756/tiktok-tom-cruise-impersonator-deepfake"&gt;went viral on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, some suggested it was a chilling sign of things to come — harbinger of an era where AI will let anyone make fake videos of anyone else. The video’s creator, though, Belgium VFX specialist &lt;a href="https://vfxchrisume.com/"&gt;Chris Ume&lt;/a&gt;, says this is far from the case. Speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about his viral clips, Ume stresses the amount of time and effort that went into making each deepfake, as well as the importance of working with a top-flight Tom Cruise impersonator, Miles Fisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDwp2M"&gt;“You can’t do it by just pressing a button,” says Ume. “That’s important, that’s a message I want to tell people.” Each clip took weeks of work, he says, using the open-source DeepFaceLab algorithm as well as established video editing tools. “By combining traditional CGI and VFX with deepfakes, it makes it better. I make sure you don’t see any of the glitches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfBZYI"&gt;Ume has been working with deepfakes for years, including creating the effects for &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9WfZuNceFDM"&gt;the “Sassy Justice” series&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;em&gt;South Park&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/arts/television/sassy-justice-south-park-deepfake.html"&gt;Trey Parker and Matt Stone&lt;/a&gt;. He started working on Cruise when he saw a video by Fisher announcing a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5Btb8gLy3-E"&gt;fictitious run for president&lt;/a&gt; by the Hollywood star. The pair then worked together on a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hQpdYWFtGeQ"&gt;follow-up&lt;/a&gt; and decided to put a series of “harmless” clips up on TikTok. Their account, @deeptomcruise, quickly racked up tens of thousands of followers and likes, before Ume pulled the videos a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RZwljT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wq-kmFCrF5Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Mnj9w8"&gt;“It’s fulfilled its purpose,” he says of the account. “We had fun. I created awareness. I showed my skills. We made people smile. And that’s it, the project is done.” A spokesperson from TikTok told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the account was well within its rules for parody uses of deepfakes, and Ume notes that Cruise — the &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;Tom Cruise — has since made his own official account, perhaps as a result of seeing his AI doppelgänger go viral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddq6G7"&gt;Deepfake technology has been developing for years now, and there’s no doubt that the results are getting more realistic and easier to make. Although there has been much speculation about the potential harm such technology could cause in politics, so far these effects have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax"&gt;relatively nonexistent&lt;/a&gt;. Where the technology is definitely causing damage is in the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/12/1018222/deepfake-revenge-porn-coming-ban/"&gt;creation of revenge porn&lt;/a&gt; or nonconsensual pornography of women. In those cases, the fake videos or images don’t have to be realistic to create tremendous damage. Simply threatening someone with the release of fake imagery, or creating rumors about the existence of such content, can be enough to ruin reputations and careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD6dZ5"&gt;The Tom Cruise fakes, though, show a much more beneficial use of the technology: as another part of the CGI toolkit. Ume says there are so many uses for deepfakes, from dubbing actors in film and TV, to restoring old footage, to animating CGI characters. What he stresses, though, is the incompleteness of the technology operating by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BWL98d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10375747"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EuHL0w"&gt;Creating the fakes took two months to train the base AI models (using a pair of NVIDIA RTX 8000 GPUs) on footage of Cruise, and days of further processing for each clip. After that, Ume had to go through each video, frame by frame, making small adjustments to sell the overall effect; smoothing a line here and covering up a glitch there. “The most difficult thing is making it look alive,” he says. “You can see it in the eyes when it’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqSTyq"&gt;A huge amount of credit goes to Fisher, says Ume, who has captured the exaggerated mannerisms of Cruise, from his manic laugh to his intense delivery. “He’s a really talented actor,” says Ume. “I just do the visual stuff.” Even then, if you look closely, you can still see moments where the illusion fails, as in the clip below where Fisher’s eyes and mouth glitch for a second as he puts the sunglasses on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f2OOuZ"&gt;Although Ume’s point is that his deepfakes take a lot of work and a professional impersonator, it’s also clear that the technology &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; improve over time. Exactly how easy it will be to make seamless fakes in the future is difficult to predict, and experts are busy developing tools that can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21289164/facebook-deepfake-detection-challenge-unsolved-problem-ai"&gt;automatically identify fakes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amber-authenticate-video-validation-blockchain-tampering-deepfakes/"&gt;verify unedited footage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Td8gDm"&gt;Ume, though, says he isn’t too worried about the future. We’ve developed such technology before and society’s conception of truth has more or less survived. “It’s like Photoshop 20 years ago, people didn’t know what photo editing was, and now they know about these fakes,” he says. As deepfakes become more and more of a staple in TV and movies, people’s expectations will change, as they did for imagery in the age of Photoshop. One thing’s for certain, says Ume, and it’s that the genie can’t be put back in the bottle. “Deepfakes are here to stay,” he says. “Everyone believes in it.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Unannounced Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti GPU appears on Asus’ website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iCMWUI8MV12hpTJYvtQiyEV5rrw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916650/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yMr1aA"&gt;Nvidia might be preparing to launch a new RTX 3050 Ti GPU, according to a leak from laptop maker Asus. &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-confirms-geforce-rtx-3050-ti-laptop-gpu-with-4gb-gddr6-memory"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Asus has published updated specifications for its latest TUF Dash F15 gaming laptop, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FLaptops%2FFor-Gaming%2FTUF-Gaming%2F2021-ASUS-TUF-Dash-F15%2Ftechspec%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22315175%2Fnvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu-asus-leak-rumor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it mentions&lt;/a&gt; an unreleased Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeOPh"&gt;The numbering scheme suggests Nvidia could be about to launch a fourth 30-Series laptop GPU to join the existing RTX 3060, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 cards. Asus’ website mentions the card has 4GB of memory, but the company hasn’t included any further details on clock speeds etc. The RTX 3050 Ti is rumored to be an entry-level option, with a 128-bit memory bus and 60W TGP. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kC2Gk9zH8nw1GrD3979kb0uaaHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347708/av1egMf.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YjDh3c"&gt;Nvidia’s launch of RTX 30-Series laptop GPUs has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243065/nvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency"&gt;been a little confusing&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia is no longer adding “Max-Q” labels to the weaker, more power-efficient variants of its laptop-grade GPUs, and it’s more difficult to tell exactly what GPU you’re getting. Nvidia has started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;requiring laptop makers&lt;/a&gt; to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs, but the previous Max-Q branding made it a lot easier to work out a laptop’s GPU performance without having to know its specific clock speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78GpOm"&gt;We’ve reached out to both Nvidia and Asus to comment on the RTX 3050 Ti appearance, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is making it easier for creators to answer their fans’ questions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aye7VujKvQdYyO3I50r3TeFqKMg=/0x0:1938x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916070/b02170a10e78426f1f250ee62f745091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presenters can spotlight questions during a live stream.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="veWK2Q"&gt;TikTok has &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-q-and-a"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; a new Q&amp;amp;A feature that’s designed to help creators answer questions from their fans. It’s available on both pre-recorded and live videos, and works by having viewers mark their comment as a question. Creators can then either answer questions via a text comment or video reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEbVFp"&gt;In live videos, presenters can select questions from a dedicated menu, and then choose to highlight them during live responses. In video replies, Q&amp;amp;A comments can be added as stickers, which link back to the video where the question was originally asked. A new section in a creator’s profile aggregates all their Q&amp;amp;As into one place as well as serving as another place for viewers to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AghwoX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6935520747200711942" data-video-id="6935520747200711942" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Q&amp;amp;A feature is now here to help you ask or answer any questions. Try it out now!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6935520869284334341"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHJeXq"&gt;TikTok says the feature is available for Creator Accounts, which anyone can switch to via the “Manage account” option in settings. “To turn on Q&amp;amp;A, go to your settings and privacy page, select Creator, tap Q&amp;amp;A and hit the “Turn on Q&amp;amp;A” button to activate the feature,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKXcQg"&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A feature was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/tiktoks-new-qa-feature-lets-creators-respond-to-fan-questions-using-text-or-video/"&gt;being tested&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year as an opt-in feature to Creator Accounts with over 10,000 followers. Now, it’s available worldwide to anyone who wants to opt-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6xEvk0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6935521116114914566" data-video-id="6935521116114914566" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now ask and answer any questions on LIVE with the new Q&amp;amp;A feature.

    <title>Getaround wants to help you start your own car-sharing business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Car-Sharing Companies Offer A Less Germ-Infested Route Forward" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ozx8U5p2qdlbmuOVZz12LQPKW1I=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916016/1219575018.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Afc22"&gt;Getaround, the peer-to-peer car-sharing service, is launching a new program to help support people who want to rent out more than just a couple of cars. The program is called Power Host, and it’s designed to help customers manage small fleets of shared vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N08qOf"&gt;Getaround, which operates in 800 cities globally and has over 6 million users, created the program in response to a growing number of its customers seeking to start a small car-sharing business for themselves. After an initial steep drop in bookings after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Getaround has since seen its demand bounce back. And now people are looking for ways to use the platform in a more professional capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IK8hy"&gt;“We just started seeing a significant increase in owners who had a few cars [and] who wanted to buy more,” Dan Kim, chief operating officer at Getaround, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They were seeing a lot more demand and they wanted to just have more vehicles and more service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hw05p3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We just started seeing a significant increase in owners who had a few cars [and] who wanted to buy more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidQwW"&gt;He added, “Our hosts were asking for help on how to grow the business. We responded with a program that really helps anybody who wants to use Getaround as an opportunity to grow their business and to do so effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24b6cV"&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getaround.com%2Fpromotions%2Fcar-sharing-for-entrepreneurs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22314188%2Fgetaround-car-sharing-power-host-enterprise-business" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Power Host&lt;/a&gt;, customers will get access to a personal account manager from Getaround who can help them manage their fleets. Getaround will also supply Power Host users with data that will help them figure out the best place to put their cars. For example, if Getaround sees that demand for a car rental is high in a certain neighborhood, the company will let its Power Host users know the best places to park their vehicles, especially those spots that are reserved for Getaround customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JiQ0x"&gt;Getaround provides a $1 million insurance that covers the vehicle’s owner while it’s in use, and access to a 24/7 hotline for both the vehicle owner and the customer who is renting it. The company says its insurance policy includes “comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage,” though the vehicle is only covered while it is in use. The company also provides guidance to vehicle owners on best practices for cleaning, maintenance, and sanitizing their fleet to ensure customers are protected from any possible contagions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRN4cp"&gt;Kim, who formerly worked as the head of Airbnb plus and head of global sales and delivery at Tesla, joined the company in October on the heels of a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/"&gt;$140 million investment deal&lt;/a&gt; that brought Getaround’s total known venture funding to $600 million. He said that the business is recovering from the dramatic decrease in demand that it experienced at the start of the pandemic and was looking for new revenue sources as it continues to work its way through its recovery. Kim noted that car-sharing is asset-light compared to legacy car rental companies, in so far as it doesn’t own its fleet of vehicles, and is less dependent on business travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D50Pw5"&gt;Several reports surfaced last year that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/thieves-are-using-peer-to-peer-car-rental-apps-to-find-their-next-ride/2020/02/13/b84d8e16-49c0-11ea-9164-d3154ad8a5cd_story.html"&gt;car thieves were using car-sharing apps&lt;/a&gt; like Getaround to find and break into cars that had the keys left inside. Kim said that while those incidents were uncommon, Getaround works with law enforcement to help recover the vehicles for their users. The company also is working on new technology, such as safer lox boxes for keys, to deter theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cOOtM"&gt;It’s also working on improving its carbon footprint. Kim says research shows that car-sharing helps reduce car ownership, which helps decrease the amount of carbon that is emitted into the atmosphere. He noted that, unlike most car owners, which tend to purchase large gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, the most popular cars on Getaround are smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, like Tesla or Toyota Prius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTvu4p"&gt;“Perhaps you might drive the same number of miles, but maybe you’re driving more efficient cars, you’re driving cars that are more appropriate for your use case,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s latest USB-C hub supports 4K at 60Hz, and 100W pass-through</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WwWPVkneTRTcQBEKrDn8zECeiyo=/0x0:1158x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915882/ezgif.com_gif_maker__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDMI, VGA, USB-A, and USB-C ports are all included.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gq2LhR"&gt;Satechi has released a new USB-C hub for your laptop to add all the ports that it arguably should have included in the first place. Although the port selection on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2Fusb-c-on-the-go-multiport-adapter%3Fvariant%3D33736080523352&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22314998%2Fsatechi-usb-c-on-the-go-multiport-adapter-4k-60hz-100w-sd-card-gigabith-ethernet-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99 USB-C On-the-Go Multiport Adapter&lt;/a&gt; is similar to other hubs, the high spec of each port makes Satechi’s device worthy of attention. As well as laptops, it also works with USB-C tablets like recent iPad Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UNvKU"&gt;The hub’s got HDMI, which offers a maximum resolution of 4K and refresh rate of 60Hz, and there’s USB-C PD pass-through charging at &lt;a href="https://support.satechi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057100052-Will-the-USB-C-PD-pass-through-port-charge-my-16-inch-MacBook-Pro-"&gt;up to 100W&lt;/a&gt; (though you have to provide your own power brick). The cable for attaching it to your device isn’t fixed like it is on some hubs, and Satechi supplies two USB-C to USB-C cables with the hub. One’s 1-m long, and there’s a second short cable that can be tucked into the hub when you’re traveling. Rounding out the selection there’s a VGA port that supports up to 1080p/60Hz, two USB-A and one USB-C data-only ports, gigabit Ethernet, and SD and microSD card slots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ao9dL6nAJNfMe0KTzTDZQHTpsfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347526/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works with laptops and USB-C tablets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7IhBRA"&gt;We’ve seen plenty of USB-C hubs offer similar specs in the past, but it’s less common to see them all offered together in such a convenient package. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/12/20692048/sony-usb-c-hub-mrw-s3-pd-charging-100w-uhs-ii-sd-card-fast-speeds"&gt;MRW-S3 announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; offered 100W USB-C PD but maxed out at 4K/30Hz. This &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fvariant%2Fpowerexpand-8in1-usbc-pd-10gbps-data-hub%2FA83830A1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22314998%2Fsatechi-usb-c-on-the-go-multiport-adapter-4k-60hz-100w-sd-card-gigabith-ethernet-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C hub from Anker&lt;/a&gt; does 4K/60Hz and “charging at up to 100W (minus 15W for operation)” but it’s got a short USB-C host cable that isn’t detachable. Satechi’s new hub also only takes up one USB-C port on your device, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20826671/satechi-usb-c-hub-4k-60hz-hdmi-multimedia-adapter-macos"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; we’ve &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/11/hyper-duo-usb-c-hub-100-w-charging-macbook-pro/"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gegbTy"&gt;It also offers the flexibility of an additional VGA port alongside its HDMI port, though a Satechi &lt;a href="https://support.satechi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057569491-Can-you-connect-2-external-monitors-using-the-HDMI-and-VGA-port-on-the-hub-"&gt;support page notes&lt;/a&gt; that “the VGA port only supports mirroring.” That’s likely to make the VGA port most useful for connecting your laptop or tablet to a projector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aqbuU"&gt;Satechi’s new hub is available now for $99.99, and until March 15th the company is offering 20 percent off if you use the code “MULTIPORT20”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="JGdlxy"&gt;Google says it will speed up how it releases Chrome updates. Starting with Chrome 94 in Q3, 2021, Google will release milestones of its browser every four weeks, instead of every six weeks. This is the first time Google has sped up its Chrome release schedule for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4RnDm"&gt;“As we have improved our testing and release processes for Chrome, and deployed bi-weekly security updates to improve our patch gap, it became clear that we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly,” &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html"&gt;explains Alex Mineer&lt;/a&gt;, a technical program manager at Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oFMO1r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;IT admins can stick to an eight-week version of Chrome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q0Lw11"&gt;While consumers will see a new version of Chrome every month, IT administrators will be able to opt for a new Extended Stable option that includes milestone releases every eight weeks. Extended Stable will be available for enterprise administrators and Chromium embedders that need the extra time to manage updates in their environments. Important security updates will still arrive every two weeks in this version, but Extended Stable should hopefully avoid the situation where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966237/google-chrome-white-tab-screen-crash-experiment-it-admins"&gt;silent Chrome experiments end up angering IT admins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgYEbB"&gt;Google says it’s also planning “multiple stable release options” for Chrome OS, and will share details with Chrome OS admins in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9MMyW"&gt;It’s not yet clear how Chromium contributors like Brave and Microsoft will handle their own releases of Chromium browsers in response to Google’s changes. We’ve reached out to both Brave and Microsoft to comment on Google’s new Chrome release schedule, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what Twitter’s rumored ‘undo send’ feature could look like</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmvwn_DE4ndRspG7qi3Ute9dKwA=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915757/IuynE_2d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alongside the typical “Your Tweet was sent” dialogue, there’s a new Undo button.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kF2mZ8"&gt;A potential animation for Twitter’s long-rumored “undo send” feature has been discovered by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841"&gt;app researcher Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, giving us our best look yet at how it might work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="np6vWD"&gt;The interface shows Twitter’s familiar “Your Tweet was sent” dialog above a new “Undo” button. The undo button doubles as a progress bar, which appears to show you how long you have to undo a tweet before it gets sent. Gmail offers a similar option for emails, where it provides a short window to stop messages from being sent after clicking the “Send” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y2vQz0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on “Undo Send” timer for tweets &lt;a href="https://t.co/nS0kuijPK0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nS0kuijPK0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg0Rvu"&gt;“Undo send” has been a rumored part of a paid Twitter subscription tier after it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;first mentioned in a user survey last year&lt;/a&gt;. It might not be the “edit button” that Twitter users have been requesting forever (and which will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066815/twitter-edit-button-jack-dorsey-says-no"&gt;probably never happen&lt;/a&gt;), but it would still offer users the ability to quickly stop a tweet from posting if they spot a last second typo or Bad Take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G8EuF"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272364/twitter-premium-subscriptions-tweetdeck-undo-send-tipping-ads"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter is exploring paid subscriptions as a way to reduce its reliance on advertising revenue in response to competition from Facebook and Snapchat. The subscriptions could include access to features like “undo send” and profile customization options, it said. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reported that Twitter was exploring ways for users to pay one another for exclusive content, a feature the company later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;announced as Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Dn9mw"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong is an app researcher who digs through code to find unreleased and unannounced features. Last year she was among the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/4/21500687/twitter-birdwatch-misinfo-tool-propaganda"&gt;first to spot Twitter’s Birdwatch initiative&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to root out misinformation on its service, and she also spotted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21626494/twitter-verification-returns-early-2021-policy-feedback"&gt;Twitter’s overhaul of its verification system&lt;/a&gt; prior to its official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent-branded RedMagic gaming phone launched with 165Hz screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-SCNrcWjZGJVFlJcmOJZY1R2ts=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915577/3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jt4Wf9"&gt;RedMagic, the gaming brand of ZTE subdivision Nubia, has launched a new smartphone in collaboration with Chinese tech and gaming giant Tencent. The RedMagic 6 and 6 Pro are high-end devices available to order now in China, with a global launch coming later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQdVcr"&gt;The RedMagic 6 has an Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, active fan cooling, and a 6.8-inch 1080p OLED display with a refresh rate of 165Hz, making it the fastest phone screen on the market today. RedMagic is also claiming a single-finger touch sampling rate of up to 500Hz, or up to 360Hz with multitouch. The touch-sensitive capacitive “shoulder triggers” on the side, meanwhile, are sampled at up to 400Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6jJmx"&gt;The RedMagic 6 Pro is mostly identical, but it comes with up to 18GB of RAM and has a faster 120W charging system that RedMagic says can fully charge the 4,500mAh battery in just 17 minutes. The non-Pro 6 has a bigger 5,050mAh battery but a slower 66W system that takes 38 minutes for a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HN1LvaJwULNtfRUY6d00qgw3GI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347425/4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QKP5kY"&gt;The Tencent collaboration is quite unusual. RedMagic says that the phone’s software is optimized for Tencent apps like WeChat and QQ, with 50 percent faster read and write speeds. Tencent’s Solar Core gaming software is also preloaded, and the company promises it improves game response speed, frame rates, and network latency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no35i3"&gt;The RedMagic 6 starts at 3,799 yuan (~$585) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can pay almost twice as much for a fully loaded 18GB/512GB RedMagic 6 Pro — that’ll cost 6,599 yuan (~$1,020). Global pricing will likely be different, however; RedMagic will announce international release plans on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
