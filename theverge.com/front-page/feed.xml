    <title>PC Building Simulator is free on the Epic Games Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYcRUdXUYwuXZLBjOrpbD-uPQ_k=/0x400:1200x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970162/EGS_PCBuildingSimulator_TheIrregularCorporation_S2_1200x1600_43bc7f071217ef26e11f47d86093df10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your key to the PC of your dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSB4Rz"&gt;Depending on who you ask, &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is either utterly ridiculous or incredibly satisfying. You can decide for yourself by downloading this niche simulator for &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/pc-building-simulator"&gt;free from the Epic Games Store before October 17th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxpFUf"&gt;Like the majority of sim games, &lt;em&gt;PCBS&lt;/em&gt; speaks to a very specific type of fantasy. If your idea of a good time is overclocking your computer while managing a small business, this is a game that does exactly that. My favorite feature has to be making your work computer in-game look exactly like your computer IRL. The game will even adjust the RGB lighting and wallpaper of your machine to match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJDiPksPH9yZXWamwj_yU4qm_zM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908716/IMG_20211007_171514.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s just like my desk... except cleaner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8hkw0f"&gt;However, depending on your level of experience, the game can actually serve as a worthwhile educational tool for anyone who wants to learn more about... well, building PCs. As someone who had never built a PC prior to playing this game, I actually leaned on the knowledge I got from this game when I started building my own rigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgHigC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; has received its fair share of DLC, mostly in the form of different workshop environments that are entirely cosmetic. However, it did get an esports expansion that's a little more narrative-focused and plays more like a timed puzzle game rather than a business simulation. It's also worth noting that the game regularly receives free updates that add new hardware to the already massive roster of cases, CPUs, GPUs, and other bits and bobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qXwMB4KpEIpVJkADESvf-qoEDO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908722/Screenshot_2021_10_07_171756.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alice Newcome-Beill / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve spent entirely too much time in this game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NjmT4D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; keeps most of the fun parts of this hobby front and center, while cleverly avoiding some of the frustrations and occasional tedium. There are really only two things this game doesn’t simulate: misplacing that last thumbscrew and getting thermal paste on absolutely everything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch OLED model is now available online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iex0ZHIg9K53WflfIyepHkmR4Lw=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969602/joy_con_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s newest hybrid console packs in a seven-inch OLED display and a few subtle enhancements.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjeasP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 12:42PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has released its stock of Switch OLED consoles. We’re still waiting on Walmart and Best Buy, which may be gearing up to release some. We’ll update this post as the situation develops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iwlA8"&gt;The newest version of the immensely popular Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED model, is now available online. So far, they’ve popped up at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-console-white-joy-con%2F11149258.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, but they quickly went out of stock. It’s the same story &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;through Nintendo’s online shop&lt;/a&gt;. But now Amazon has unleashed some stock of consoles. You can find the model with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white Joy-Con here&lt;/a&gt;, or the model that includes the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RL6SBJ?&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;neon red and blue Joy-Con here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSwcWy"&gt;We’ll add more retailers throughout the day as they appear online. We’re still waiting for Best Buy and Walmart to join in the fun, where there are currently landing pages that are listing both the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-White-Joy-Con%2F910582148" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white model&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-Neon-Red-Neon-Blue-Joy-Con%2F787152679" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue variant&lt;/a&gt; as being out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH79pi"&gt;The Switch OLED model is the top end of Nintendo’s current console lineup, coming in at $350, while the standard Switch and portable-only Switch Lite each sit below it at $300 and $200, respectively. The new model sports a sizable screen upgrade to a larger seven-inch OLED panel that provides much better color quality and brightness. It also brings some other niceties to the Switch, such as a sturdier kickstand with improved articulation, better audio in handheld mode, and an ethernet port built into the included dock. Its internal storage got a bump from 32GB to 64GB, too, but it’s still not a bad idea to get a microSD card, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB SanDisk model for $49 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHDJzw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Based on our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch OLED may not provide enough reasons for some to upgrade from their previous Switch, since it isn’t any faster or more capable when docked. That said, first-time Switch owners or those who want the best handheld experience when they step away from the TV should consider making the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8iYcY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10640111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="LBaIGt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10738833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="59I8EI"&gt;Essential accessories, games, and subscriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="izJ3Se"&gt;If you do manage to snag Nintendo’s latest console, there are plenty of games and optional accessories we recommend picking up, including the excellent Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and recent hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Below are a few of our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes the Apple Watch Series 6 from its official lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYWFlMkuzt0_wwbCBJd7o5Dp_Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970023/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtqCI4"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 is finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple announced the new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of the Series 7 also brings the removal of the Series 6 from the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Apple Watch lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHP2Nv"&gt;If you want to buy a brand new Apple Watch from Apple, you now only have three options: the Series 7, which starts at $399; the still-very-good SE, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; and starts at $279; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;years-old Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFwQ27"&gt;There are still a few ways to get a Series 6, though, and given how many features are shared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-6-vs-apple-watch-series-7/"&gt;between the Series 7 and the Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation model could be a good option to consider if you want to save some money. Apple’s refurbished store has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fwatch%2Fapple-watch-series-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three different Series 6 models for sale right now&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and Amazon is currently offering many &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=apple+watch+series+6&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1"&gt;refurbished Series 6 watches at a discount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Smart Clock 2 review: a good dock with an okay clock</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A decent alarm clock on a slightly pointless smart display, it’s the new charging dock that makes this worth considering  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYFC1M"&gt;Remember when alarm clocks were small, battery-powered, and lasted forever? My husband relinquished his compact Casio after 13 years because the screen finally warped and he couldn’t read the numbers anymore. That clock made it through countless Hot Shot tours fighting wildfire in Nevada and Idaho, survived in a makeshift shack in the Alaskan wilderness where he worked as a fishing guide, only to finally surrender after a couple years on his bedside table in a Charleston firehouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGzkRg"&gt;Today, alarm clocks are going through a bit of an identity crisis, as evidenced by Lenovo’s newest Smart Clock that aims to be a nightstand multitasker. In very real danger of being entirely supplanted by smartphones, the alarm clock has morphed into an all-singing, all-dancing smart display. Go on, try to find a battery-powered alarm clock that just tells you the time. No projectors, no night lights, no built-in radio, no Bluetooth, no charging ports — just the time and an alarm. (When you do, can you send it my way? I’m looking for a Christmas present for someone...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F6gvt0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10795689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ghGYtX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-smart-clock-2-with-wireless-charging-dock-abyss-blue%2F6481518.p%3FskuId%3D6481518&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s $89.99 Smart Clock 2&lt;/a&gt; has crammed as much functionality as possible into its tiny, almost five-inch by four-inch frame. It wants to be the Swiss Army knife of nightstands. Building on its first iteration as the smallest smart display on the market (ideally suited for your bedside), the Smart Clock 2 is still a Bluetooth speaker with a touchscreen and the full power of Google Assistant on tap to stream all the audio you could want. Of course, you can also ask about the weather and such, as well as control smart home devices with your voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU0kbc"&gt;What’s new is a separate dock designed for the clock that brings a night light, a wireless charging pad for your phone, and a USB Type-A port for your peripherals. Finally, you can corral all your bedside charging clutter in one space and have a fancy alarm clock (had you been waiting for that?). It still lacks any backup battery, so if the power is out, your alarm is off. To be fair, no smart alarm clock offers this, which is why my husband resolutely refuses to use one.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOm-6pciNJRU2wugYwaLh_Nj7Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909448/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2883_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Clock 2 comes with a new charging dock that includes an LED night light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vq3mwK"&gt;With a few caveats (which I’ll get to), this is a great little bedside clock albeit a minor upgrade from the original. It’s the smallest smart display footprint-wise, so a good fit for those with cluttered or tiny nightstands. The wireless charging and LED night light are excellent additions for keeping things tidy, although you’ll still need a bedside lamp as the night light is not for reading. There’s no camera in the device, and the small speakers provide just enough audio quality for some nice bedtime music and to deliver your choice of seven different alarm tones to rouse you in the morning. They sound better than a smartphone but worse than a larger smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cYXSS"&gt;As a smart display, it’s less appealing. Functionally, this is more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16453788/google-home-mini-smart-speaker-review"&gt;Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a smart speaker with some visual cues and a limited touch interface. While I like having the clock to glance at, the display feels largely wasted, and the interface relies — as most smart displays do — too heavily on voice control. For example, I couldn’t turn the night light off with touch, I had to use voice. This is frustrating particularly in the bedroom, where you’re most likely wanting a bit of quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEiFcY"&gt;The diminutive display also doesn’t do some of the main things you expect from a smart display. You can’t watch video and, while I question why you would want to on a display this small, if you’re not going to watch video you don’t really need a display this big (it’s a conundrum, I know). It will stream video from Google Nest security cameras, which is handy at night if something’s going bump outside. But it currently only works with the old Google Nest cameras, not the new ones or any third-party cameras. The screen also doesn’t give you extra visual information when you ask the Assistant questions, as Nest Hubs do, but you can pick a Google Photos album to rotate as your clock face throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPG6jj9SDTak7ceOrBLLgDJH41U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902597/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2873.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Clock 2 has a selection of about a dozen clock faces to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YAl8DXStU6go4eg9tRun6qid3JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902593/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2855.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volume up and down and a mute switch are the only physical buttons on the clock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aEhqPB"&gt;The Smart Clock 2 has a few design upgrades over the original. There’s a new color — fabric-wrapped blue in addition to gray or black (it’s all very drab, though; would it have killed Lenovo to throw in a pretty pastel?), and a new, taller form factor to accommodate sitting on the new dock. (You can buy the clock without the dock for $20 less, but you lose a lot of functionality.) The physical volume up and down buttons are still here, as is the mute switch at the back. The touch-sensitive surface between the volume buttons also remains to snooze or turn the alarm off (it requires a significant thwack, however). The USB Type-A port is gone — moved to the dock — which will disappoint some if they just opt for the clock and not the dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5zvNo"&gt;There have been no under-the-hood improvements, this is essentially the same device as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features"&gt;2019 Lenovo Smart Clock&lt;/a&gt;. The speakers have been rejigged and moved up front, but they’re the same tinny, 3-watt offerings, and the sluggish Mediatek quad-core processor remains. This translates to a slightly slower response time from the Google Assistant than on the newer Nest displays, which aren’t exactly speed demons. But the price has essentially dropped, as you can get the speaker and dock for $89.99, just $10 more than the original clock (you’re not going to find an up to 10-watt MagSafe compatible wireless charger for less than $20 anywhere else). It does require Wi-Fi to use the Google Assistant and other features, and you need to use the Google Home app on a smartphone to set it up. However, without Wi-Fi, it will function as just an alarm clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ML6yuhSQ6aN5Bgze_IeOTDz-iKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902592/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2862.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose an album photo from your Google Photos as the clock face, and it will rotate through the pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm2iAR"&gt;I had this on my nightstand for about a week, replacing a Nest Hub (first gen), and I missed my Nest Hub. Most specifically because if I’m going to have a screen by my bed, I want to be able to use it. The Lenovo Clock’s four inches was just too small to comfortably navigate. Swiping up from the bottom (for brightness and volume control, a do not disturb button, and settings) was fiddly but not half as tricky as swiping from the top for quick access to alarms, a Routine shortcut, music, and the night light. No matter how many times I pushed on the night light button, it wouldn’t turn it off, and I had to use voice (there is an adjustable timer for the night light, so it will go out on its own eventually). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5wLZs"&gt;I also missed the smart home control panel. You get five swipeable screens on this display: clock, alarms, weather, music, and calendar. The only smart home control is a shortcut to your Goodnight or Good Morning Google Home Routine and the option to turn on or off the lights in the room you are in. If I asked the device to turn off the kitchen lights, it gave me a control interface for that light, which was useful, but again, I had to use my voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9xzwk"&gt;I could probably get past these issues, mainly because I loved the wireless charger. Previous attempts at using a wireless charging pad by my bedside invariably resulted in finding it dead and buried in my dog’s bed in the morning as I managed to knock it off the charger during the night. With the Lenovo charging stand, my iPhone 13 felt secure thanks to magnets keeping it in place. Lenovo tells us these are small enough so as not to interfere with charging on Android phones. It can charge up to 10 watts, with a maximum of 7.5 watts on an iPhone, and only up to 5 watts if there’s also playing music. But even five is plenty to charge your phone overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uAhq2x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10791150"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnaRk2"&gt;The dock also looks elegant, adding a touch of sophistication to the nightstand. It’s a subtle pebble gray color with specks of blue for a textured look, a nice change from all those bright white charging stands. It conveniently doesn’t need its own cable; it takes its power from the clock, so you only have one cord to mess with. The night light is incorporated into the dock as an LED ring around where the clock sits. Helpfully, it lights up for a few seconds when you put your phone on the charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWlRgG"&gt;The clock itself has a built-in ambient light sensor that adjusts the display’s brightness, so as not to blind you while you’re trying to sleep. (Pro tip: make sure you turn the brightness setting to Automatic by tapping the brightness icon until an A appears, or else you’ll be awake all night). But it does not have the screen technology that gives the Nest Hub that non-disturbing matte look. So while it dimmed suitably, it wasn’t quite dark enough for me. The Sunrise Alarm feature is also slightly less comfortable than on the Nest Hub, casting a harsher bluish light as it attempts to gently rouse instead of the softer, more orangey glow of the Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8SprL4DxpaFh71AUifr6T5YMPw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902598/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2848.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magnets in Lenovo’s dock help keep MagSafe-compatible cases secure, handy if you like to thrash around a lot at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o5ANoP"&gt;If you are looking for the smallest, most affordable way to put a smart screen on your bedside table — Lenovo fits the bill for just $70. Spend an extra $10, and you get the night light and wireless charger. Bargain. A Nest Hub is $99, and if you’re willing to go for Amazon’s Alexa as your built-in voice assistant, you can pay $85 for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt;, but both have larger screens and bigger footprints and no charging features. If what you really want is a smart alarm clock with a smaller footprint and no distracting display, the smaller form factor of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/8/21553993/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-smart-alarm-clock-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock Essential&lt;/a&gt; may be a better fit. You’re not giving up much on the alarm clock front, and you drop your cost to $50. But you don’t get that awesome dock with your clock.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max review: the one to buy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The improvements are minor but worth the extra cash&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eDsKlK"&gt;The tech industry sure has put a lot of hype behind descriptors like “max” over the last few years. So when Amazon announced the $54.99 Fire TV Stick 4K Max last month, I couldn’t help but cringe at the idea of a streaming device picking up that kind of branding. What could max possibly mean in this context? It’s got nothing to do with the physical design; the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is visually indistinguishable from the existing Fire TV Stick 4K. And the two products go tit for tat in their core video and audio streaming features despite the older model often being discounted; at the time of this review, the regular Fire TV Stick 4K is on sale for $33.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQhV9y"&gt;In this case, “max” is actually about the smaller things. The new stick is 40 percent more powerful than the standard version, which results in apps launching faster and navigation that feels noticeably more fluid and free of stutters or lag. There’s more RAM inside so you don’t have to wait for apps to completely reload as often. Amazon has upgraded the Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi 6 for better wireless streaming performance — assuming you’ve got a router that can take advantage of it. And you also get a newer Alexa voice remote in the box with app shortcuts and a handy shortcut to live TV programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvTwxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10795928"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjMJ2L"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the stick itself is impossible to tell apart from the standard Fire TV Stick 4K. Unfortunately, despite going “max,” Amazon apparently didn’t see fit to upgrade to USB-C for the (required) plug-in power; this device retains the Micro USB on its side. But getting up and running remains easy: plug the Fire TV Stick 4K Max into a free HDMI port on your TV, find an outlet for that USB power adapter, toss the included batteries into the remote, and you’re good to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqHF9U"&gt;Amazon bundles the latest version of its Alexa voice remote with the new streaming stick. Aside from the usual playback buttons, there are also dedicated TV controls for power and volume. And you’ll also find four branded shortcuts for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. (These can technically be reprogrammed, &lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-remap-the-app-buttons-on-fire-tv-edition-remotes-with-remapper/"&gt;but it’s quite a process&lt;/a&gt;.) You’ve still got to press and hold the Alexa button for voice searches or smart home commands. Speaking of which, one new trick the Fire TV Stick 4K Max gains over the regular model is the ability to see a live, picture-in-picture view of your home cameras. The Fire TV Cube can also do this, but not any of Amazon’s other streaming gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/REQKsS4DASf4N88SVnRuvZOFheA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909636/DSCF5770.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max comes with Amazon’s latest Alexa voice remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CReHlk"&gt;Another advantage of the newer remote is the guide button, which can quickly take you to live TV from supported services that integrate directly with Amazon’s channel guide. These include YouTube TV, Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV, Pluto TV, Tubi, and more. It’s not like the live TV tab is difficult to find on the Fire TV homescreen, but I’m always here for time savers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk2QFq"&gt;When it comes to their visual capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Stick 4K are fundamentally identical. They both offer Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG. One quiet upgrade Amazon made to the newer hardware is support for AV1 video decoding, which will be welcome news to YouTube; AV1 decoding was one of the points of contention in the company’s very public spat with Roku. Amazon adopting the functionality should head off the possibility of a similar dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyuQZm"&gt;Sound specs between Amazon’s two 4K sticks (each supports Dolby Atmos) are also &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be the same, but this is one area where the newer stick pulls ahead because of… Netflix. For whatever reason, &lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/dolby-atmos-surround-sound-audio-is-supported-in-netflix-on-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;AFTVnews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the streaming giant doesn’t support Atmos on the regular Fire TV Stick 4K because it runs an older version of the Fire OS software. Since the newer Stick 4K Max ships with the current Fire OS 7, you get the full Atmos experience when watching Netflix. If you’ve got an Atmos soundbar or surround system, that more immersive audio might be enough for you to spend extra on the Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5e4a7ZSE8MWLXGgntvyzRY9jFqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909639/football.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV homescreen still puts a heavy emphasis on Amazon content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J1kMMKzJNaZ7jHBudjk5O3IFzWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909640/peek.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you hover over one of your favorite apps, you can see what’s popular.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSnB-Sb1L5YUXYStGmWk3Y_ciFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909643/livetv.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The live TV guide integrates with Sling TV, YouTube TV, and other services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a4cvTH"&gt;In keeping with the rest of Amazon’s Fire TV lineup, the Stick 4K Max runs the overhauled software experience that the company &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21540615011"&gt;rolled out earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; with user profiles, a more personalized homescreen, and a new “find” feature for picking the night’s entertainment. Thanks to its more powerful CPU, GPU, and additional RAM (now 2GB instead of 1.5GB), the new stick breezes through navigating all the various corners of the Fire TV OS. And apps did seem to load up quicker than on the standard Stick 4K — and certainly faster compared to my Chromecast with Google TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f6Vt8"&gt;That said, Amazon remains heavy-handed with banner ads on the homescreen and is still a little too in your face when promoting its own content. It’s possible to install a different launcher or set up Pi-hole to block some of the advertising, but that’s a step most consumers will never take. The reality is that this is just something you’ve got to put up with if you want a very capable 4K streaming device for under $60. If the ads drive you nuts, the more expensive Apple TV 4K or Nvidia Shield would be wiser choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5vtft7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10795817"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idzlG3"&gt;There’s definitely a case to be made that the Fire TV Stick 4K Max should have just &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;/em&gt; the slower Fire TV Stick 4K. Amazon’s lineup is now feeling crowded between the Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K Max, and the second-gen Fire TV Cube. The Cube is well distinguished as its own thing, but I can imagine some people would be very confused when shopping between the others. And Amazon discounts these devices so frequently that you’re really not looking at a giant price gulf between most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgP5Pv"&gt;So my advice is this: if you want Amazon’s best straightforward 4K streamer, spend the little bit extra and go with the new Fire TV Stick 4K Max. The speed enhancements really do make for a more satisfying user experience. And even if your home network isn’t yet running on Wi-Fi 6, you’ll have some future proofing in that respect. The Fire TV Cube remains more powerful still, but if you don’t need hands-free Alexa voice controls, it’s overkill for the purpose of entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2TAaG"&gt;I still don’t know whether it’s worthy of the Max moniker, but this is now definitely the Amazon streaming player to buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Grand Theft Auto trilogy is getting remastered for PC and consoles, including Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0a0ByCxLdZ1241GIznxeEuw2eY=/38x0:602x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969467/gta3_android002.1323195668.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This still is from the Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition, not the upcoming remaster.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: GTA3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PualCO"&gt;After several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623125/rockstar-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas-remaster-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-mobile"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar Games has confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; are each getting HD remasters. They’ll be released in a package called &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;. The collection is coming to PC (via the Rockstar Games Launcher), PlayStation, Xbox, and, more surprisingly, the Nintendo Switch will host them, too. It will come to iOS and Android in the first half of 2022. Pricing and release date info hasn’t been shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6tBcp"&gt;The company hasn’t explicitly mentioned what kind of technical improvements were made, nor has it shared any footage yet. But it says that each of the games has gotten “across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements.” The company chose to take the faithful route for its remasters, leaving “the classic look and feel of the originals” how they were presented on PS2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-Xg96rw7smvVZjMNA9Wn0YtCUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910140/image003.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HotGQM"&gt;In case you’re someone who grew up with &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; (understandable, given it is eight years old) and haven’t had an easy way to play these earlier influential games, this seems like a great time to jump in. It might feel weird to play a &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; game that doesn’t let you swap between protagonists, but the adventures of Claude, the silent protagonist in &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;; Tommy Vercetti in &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and CJ in &lt;em&gt;San Andreas &lt;/em&gt;are still very much worth playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omoQBY"&gt;Rockstar says that we’ll find out more about the collection of games in the coming weeks. But ahead of the launch, it’ll begin removing existing versions of each title from digital storefronts next week, so pick those up if you want them before you no longer have a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your default browser in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8IAO-yddsFROKJiSFhQjwQcl7Q=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969424/Screenshot__84_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cb5cUv"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6FBt5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8h8sJa"&gt;Normally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IXoc02"&gt;Switch default browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPB00S"&gt;If you don’t want Edge to be your default browser, and your favorite browser isn’t offering to make the change for you, here’s how to switch the default. For this example, I’m using Google Chrome, but this should work with any browser that you have installed on your system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GQSVmd"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKk51R"&gt;Under “Set defaults for applications” either scroll down to where your preferred browser is listed or type the name in the “Search apps” field. Click on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDDskYt1jzHp3HLJw6aXzow1X2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908532/Screenshot__5_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BRZ48p"&gt;You’ll see a list of browser-related files, and under each file name, the app with which it is currently associated. In Windows 11, you can’t simply change your default browser with a single click — you have to change the assigned browser for every specific file type. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MCDLub"&gt;Look for the file types assigned to Edge, such as .HTM, .HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, and perhaps .PDF (unless you have a PDF reader you prefer). Click on the ones you want to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeVLc0rLMFwg4s4a8cFnjJJPU0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908534/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6e8TOE"&gt;You may get a “Before you switch” pop-up urging you to try Microsoft Edge — go ahead and click on “Switch anyway.” You’ll get a pop-up with a “Keep using this app” selection on top, and your other installed browsers below. Go ahead and select the one you want to use. (Be aware that there may be some file types that won’t offer your browser as an alternative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSqQpQeceV5bNmVJAzIzEy2Q6zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908535/Screenshot__8_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10SILw"&gt;Note: by the time you read this, some browsers may have instituted a system for letting you more easily switch your default browser. For example, when this was written, the first time I opened Firefox, it asked if I wanted it to become the default. I let it go ahead, and when I went to the “Default apps” section of setup, I found that Firefox was now set as the default for .HTM, .HTML, .HTTP., and .HTTPS files. Edge was still listed for .PDF, .SHTML, .SVG, .XHT, and .XHTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOxLw8O3ehIDvA7Wfp9CIs56Yy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910128/Screenshot__92_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45S2Ao"&gt;One more thing: if you do open Edge for any reason, you will get the expected pop-up urging you to return to “recommended browser settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5F9mA7"&gt;That won’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QXShIl"&gt;But wait — there’s more. Even after you switch your browser default to something other than Edge, you’re still going to get Edge as the favored browser for a number of Windows apps. For example, bring up Windows 11’s new Widget pane (by click on the Widgets icon in your taskbar, the one that looks like a two-paned window), and click on one of the news items that appears there — and the link will open Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqLu97"&gt;If you find that irritating, there may be an app for that. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xHc-FNSm%24"&gt;EdgeDeflector&lt;/a&gt; is a small tool that was originally created to intercept any links in Windows 10 that were Edge-specific and rewrite them on the fly so that they can be opened by the default web browser. I did a little browsing and read that its latest version, v1.2.3.0, would work with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42C5rv"&gt;I installed and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.daniel.priv.no/tools/edgedeflector/post-install.html__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xGOdR8WW%24"&gt;followed the directions for setup&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while that worked for most links, when I clicked on a link from the news sources in the Widgets pane, it didn’t quite work — the link opened in Chrome, but none of the graphics came through. I’d keep an eye on this app, though...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHjRwI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="En3bnm"&gt;This week, Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; policy editor Russell Brandom and managing editor Alex Cranz to cover the series of unfortunate events for Facebook: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;whistleblower interview&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;the massive Facebook outage&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;whistleblower Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, and the fallout and response the following days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRkn6B"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;crew discusses whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony, how these events stood out amongst the various Facebook scandals of the past, and what could happen next with tech regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tar balls, oiled birds, and months of cleanup on California’s beaches </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Major oil spill in Orange County" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MmkqvMYgs8L9135L3L287lCQmPg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969189/1235738711.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;As the oil spill spread across Orange County, an aerial view of Laguna Beach Wednesday, Oct. 6, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yreL9W"&gt;Coastal communities are still reeling from a recent oil spill off Southern California that coated &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/04/photos-southern-california-coast-oil-spill-show-damage/5986903001/"&gt;shorelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22708654/oil-spills-wildlife-huntington-beach-california"&gt;marine life&lt;/a&gt; in black tar. Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency after a pipeline ruptured late last week, unleashing an oil slick spanning 8,320 acres on waters near some of California’s most iconic beaches. Officials are still investigating the cause of the spill but think that a cargo ship’s anchor might have snagged and tore through the pipeline, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-06/did-shipping-gridlock-and-an-anchor-spark-massive-oil-spill"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eheZeh"&gt;It could take months to assess and clean up some of the mess, and longer for ecosystems to recover. To learn more about what to expect, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Steve Murawski, a fisheries biologist and marine ecologist at the University of South Florida who studies the impact humans have on ocean ecosystems. Murawski was also the lead editor of the book &lt;em&gt;Scenarios and Responses to Future Deep Oil Spills&lt;/em&gt; and previously served as chief scientist of the National Marine Fisheries Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oo8pA6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was hoping you could give me some context or a sense of scale when it comes to spills. How significant of a spill is the one off the coast of Southern California?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3ST8E"&gt;To put this in a little perspective, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228577/offshore-drilling-deepwater-horizon-10-year-anniversary"&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, which was the largest accidental spill in global history, was about 2 million barrels. The Exxon Valdez spill was about 260,000 barrels. This one is about 3,400 barrels (about 144,000 gallons). Just in terms of volume, it’s a small percentage of what we would consider a catastrophic oil spill. That’s one perspective on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4AtyXl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s all about location”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gfRz48"&gt;But it’s all about location. This is an oil spill of modest size; it’s in a very sensitive area. It’s only about four miles offshore. So just because it’s small, doesn’t mean it’s not significant. It’s very close to what we call amenity beaches, like Huntington Beach all the way down to Dana Point. Those are fully utilized for all kinds of recreation. That area in Southern California, you have a sort of persistent westward and southwestern wind. And so it only takes a few hours for that oil to be up on the beach. In the case of Deepwater Horizon, it was 50 miles offshore. It took weeks for the oil to actually come onto shore and so people could prepare for it. Here, there was no real preparation that you could do. It was up on the beach before people even knew you had a spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlltDe"&gt;The other thing that you have to realize is, no two spills are exactly the same. It’s partially the geographic setup of the place, the wind, the tides, and all that. And it’s also the composition of the oil itself. Deepwater was what we would call Louisiana light sweet crude. I mean it was almost like cooking oil, it’s very light. This one, and all of the Southern California oils, are extremely heavy, dark, dense, oils. Heavy crude oils are higher in heavy components like asphaltenes, so they tend to be more toxic than the lighter ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvyf0N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what risks might that oil pose to wildlife and people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdhRJ8"&gt;Oil is a conglomeration of about 40,000 different compounds. But the most problematic ones are the so called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAH. These PAH can be both toxic, that is they poison things, and they are also carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Major oil spill in Huntington Beach" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uD7ARclKhx7IWB4wgbIsp5MuaD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908930/1235679737.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Allen J. Schaben / &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil lines the beach as a bird runs to avoid the incoming tide while a major oil spill washes ashore on the border of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach at the Santa Ana River Jetties Sunday, October 3rd, 2021 in Huntington Beach, California. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ag0n0p"&gt;There’s two major sets of ecological issues, not only with PAH’s, but other components as well. One is worker health and safety. I noticed most of the workers are wearing PPE; that’s great. In terms of toxicity in wildlife, the most critical early issues are for the air breathers. So this would be the marine mammals and birds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajb9Hh"&gt;You always see pictures of oiled birds in oil spills. It’s problematic for them because it’s hard for them to regulate their body temperatures when they get oil on their feathers and skin. You often see birds preening. What they’re doing is they’re fluffing out their feathers because that’s their protection. So when they get oiled they start preening. As they’re preening with their beaks they’re ingesting the oil. You see a lot of media showing birds being cleaned with detergents and what not. The prognosis for those birds is generally not very good. It’s partly because they’ve ingested oil as well as getting it on their skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBmqr2"&gt;With the air breathers, there’s different ways that oil gets into their bodies and one of them is basically aspirating the oil, which gets into the lungs and the circulatory system. Like dolphins that may be in that water, they don’t do a good job avoiding oil. You know, it’s not something they encounter all the time. That area down there has a number of large whale species. Luckily, some of the major migrations have already happened and return migrations haven’t started, but that’s certainly something to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCrPn7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In California, authorities are collecting oil on the surface of the water &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/05/us/california-oil-spill-explainer/index.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;using mechanical equipment called skimmers. And they’ve set up barriers called booms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to try to stop the oil from spreading. What else can be done to clean up the spill, especially after it reaches shore?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2bVBD"&gt;Of all the habitats where oil can get into, beaches are probably one of the least complex in order to actually mitigate the effects of the spill and pick up the oil. It’s not a very convoluted habitat and you can use machinery to groom those beaches, to get rid of tar balls and all that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot4cvz"&gt;Particularly with this heavy crude oil, the oil comes in on waves and it gets mixed with beach sand. And so you get these patties that form, and they will persist at what we call the toe of the beach — that’s sort of where the waves break. And so I wouldn’t be surprised that as winter storms come, you’ll see tar balls cast on that beach all winter long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MU6bYB"&gt;The more problematic issue with the California spill is that there are several points of headlands there that enter into estuaries and marshes. Once oil enters the estuary and marsh habit, it cannot be cleaned up. I mean you can skim some oil at the surface, but once it gets entangled in all the wetlands vegetation, there’s no real way to mitigate that without causing more damage than the oil would itself. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqmJdl"&gt;One of the strategies for these habitats is to try to string booms across the mouths of these estuaries to intercept the oil that might be coming in. That can be effective if the weather and wave action cooperate. But if it’s bad weather, oil just hops over these booms which are not particularly high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jOdkMH"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “It will probably be there for decades.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d7J3dt"&gt;Once it’s in a habitat like this, there’s a lot of sediment that gets transported there until eventually the oil will be sequestered by the sediment. It’s sort of landfilled. Once it’s landfilled deep enough, oxygen will not get to it, and it’s the oxygen exposure and the sunlight that actually weathers oil. So once it’s below the oxygen line, it’ll degrade extremely slowly. It will probably be there for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio review: back to the drawing board</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft rethinks what a creator-focused laptop should be and is mostly successful&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="exRwHq"&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop Studio is both familiar and unique at the same time. If you don’t peer too closely, you’ll see what appears to be a standard, clamshell laptop. The similarities to Apple’s MacBook Pro designs are undeniable — the rounded corners, the layout of the keyboard and trackpad on the deck, even the port layouts all scream Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhQ3YG"&gt;But in typical Surface fashion, there’s something different going on when you look closer. Though you can use the Laptop Studio just like a standard laptop, you can also pull the screen forward to bring it closer to you for touch interaction, or lay it flat to write on it like a tablet. Microsoft is not the first manufacturer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688432/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-book-3-specs-step-backwards"&gt;deploy such a design&lt;/a&gt;, but the Surface Laptop Studio is certainly the sleekest laptop yet with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwsfXT"&gt;The company envisions digital artists using the screen in its various positions to draw on it, or lay it flat when docked to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard for digital note taking. It’s an evolution of what Microsoft did with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271735/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-15-inch-screen-size-specs-features-price"&gt;Surface Book line&lt;/a&gt;, but without that computer’s compromises in performance and portability. The Laptop Studio works just as well as a standard laptop as it does as a device for making digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="30E9ba"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Surface Pro 8 review: the best of both worlds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"},{"title":"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"},{"title":"Microsoft Surface Go 3 review: left behind","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22713963/microsoft-surface-go-3-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="N4RHq3"&gt;That evolution doesn’t come cheap, though. The Laptop Studio starts at $1,599.99 for a basic model — equip it with a faster processor; more RAM and storage; and a discrete GPU, and you’ll easily add a thousand dollars to that number. And even then, the Laptop Studio doesn’t have access to the most powerful chips or graphics cards available today. With so many excellent creator-focused laptops to choose from, many of which offer more power for considerably less money, you really have to want the Laptop Studio’s pivoting screen or head-turning design to justify its cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="clg59l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10796711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbPTEa8NuHwrcqNlBMn7JAdWxKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909922/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_24.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “tent” position of the Laptop Studio’s screen blocks the keyboard but provides access to the trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="H4LIU6"&gt;The Laptop Studio’s top half is only a little bit thicker than a normal laptop lid, but otherwise is completely normal when using it as a typical laptop. The main hinge is stiff and doesn’t wobble — a common problem with Microsoft’s older Surface Book design — but you can still open it with one finger easily. The magnesium and aluminum chassis is sturdy and well made, with nary a flex to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpJSbs"&gt;The Laptop Studio’s design is also sturdier-feeling and more stable than the typical convertible laptop with a 360-degree hinge. It has options for more powerful components than you typically find in a convertible laptop or Microsoft’s own thin-and-light Surface Pro 8, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXDeAf"&gt;The screen is a 14.4-inch touch display, with 2400 x 1600 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s bright and color accurate, just like other Surface displays, and it’s large enough to comfortably split the screen between multiple windows using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710511/windows-11-snap-layouts-how-to"&gt;Windows 11’s new Snap layouts&lt;/a&gt;. The 120Hz refresh rate provides much smoother scrolling with the cursor, better touch interactions, and reduced latency with pen input. The Surface-signature 3:2 aspect ratio makes working with documents and browsing websites more comfortable, but it also gives the Laptop Studio a footprint that’s almost as big as a 15-inch laptop. At over four pounds and 0.7 inches thick, this isn’t exactly an ultra-portable laptop, but it’s not a huge chore to lug around, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUWiJs"&gt;Pulling the screen forward is a bit awkward — you have to reach up and bend the top half backward until the magnets holding the bottom half in place release, and then you can bring it closer to you. You can then park it halfway across the deck, tenting it above the keyboard, but still providing access to the trackpad. Magnets in the deck grab the edge of the screen to “lock” it in place. I struggled to find a good use case for this mode other than watching movies on an airplane tray table or poking around on the touchscreen, as the angle of the display is still too vertical to comfortably write on it with a pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EysQPz"&gt;From the “tent” position, you can then lift the screen up and flatten it down entirely, turning the computer into an awkward and heavy tablet. This mode makes sense for drawing or writing — the screen is flat and it’s easy to lean over it and start working with a pen. But you’re not going to want to use it in place of an iPad or other lightweight tablet for watching movies or reading in bed, it’s just too bulky and heavy to practically do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8ujbysyy_U_Roh4mGPsl1u7kz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909923/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A side view of the Surface Laptop Studio in tent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muSPBB-BE-syVCWEOnCyMkWUbVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909938/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The flat position of the screen is ideal for note taking or drawing with the Surface Pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwOU0g"&gt;Around the screen are relatively large bezels, at least compared to Dell’s XPS computers. The corners of the screen are aggressively rounded — so much so that they sometimes cut into the window of an app that’s docked to the side of the screen. The bezel also houses a 2-megapixel 1080p webcam with Windows Hello facial login. This camera is not as nice as the 5-megapixel sensor in the Surface Pro computers, and it made my face look red in video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEBlwL"&gt;The bottom half of the Laptop Studio also has some unique features, but you have to actually lift the machine up to see them. Hidden below the deck is a platform of sorts that raises the laptop up a few millimeters. Though it makes the Laptop Studio noticeably thicker than a Surface Pro, it allows for one of Intel’s more powerful (and hot) processors and a discrete GPU, plus the cooling systems needed to make those parts run efficiently. I thought this platform would make typing on the keyboard awkward, but in actual use it’s nearly invisible and doesn’t require lifting my wrists up any more than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNb7oR"&gt;The Laptop Studio’s fan layout is rather strange, though. Unlike most laptops, which have their fans toward the back of the computer to blow air away from you, the Studio’s are in the front half of the bottom deck. They exhaust on each side of the computer — when it’s under load, you can feel quite a bit of warm air shooting out the sides. Most of the time, the fans are quiet and dormant, so unless you’re playing a game or running an intensive application, you won’t even notice them. Even under load, the Laptop Studio’s fans are nowhere near as loud as a typical gaming laptop, either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXrKRpe-2D6l13vZi9YgCP1If_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909936/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Laptop Studio’s keyboard and trackpad are both excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2928WF"&gt;Two of the Laptop Studio’s four speakers vent out of the sides of the platform as well, while the other two are under the keyboard. The Studio’s audio is better than average and works well for video calls, but it doesn’t quite have the punch or room-filling ability of a MacBook Pro 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3kcMw"&gt;That unique platform under the laptop also provides a place for the Surface Slim Pen 2 ($129.99, not included) to be stored and charged. Just under the front lip of the computer are magnets that grab the pen and hold on tightly, so it’s always there and charged when you want to use it. It’s a more stable system than the magnets on the side of the screen used to hold the pens on older Surface computers or the iPad Pro, yet it’s more elegant than the garages that other laptop makers provide to store a stylus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mv5sc"&gt;An aside on the new Slim Pen 2: it’s got a similar shape and weight to the Slim Pen introduced a couple of years ago, but it has a finer point and a new haptic system that provides subtle vibration feedback as you write or draw on the screen. My colleague Tom Warren &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710381/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-hands-on"&gt;wrote about the pen separately&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll add that it greatly improves the handwriting experience in apps that support the haptics, giving me more feedback and control than older Surface pens. Unfortunately, the haptics are only available in a handful of apps. Stranger still, popular note-taking apps like Microsoft’s own OneNote, Nebo, or Evernote don’t yet utilize them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjEW5Z"&gt;I am not an artist, so it’s difficult for me to speak to using the Studio and the new pen for creating art. If you are, I suggest checking out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/thebradcolbow"&gt;Brad Colbow’s videos on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, he’s a cartoonist who tests tablets and styli to see how well they work for making digital art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hn1QAL"&gt;In addition to other design elements, Microsoft appears to also be taking inspiration from Apple with the Laptop Studio’s port selection. Instead of the multiple varieties of ports that were on the Book line, the Studio has just two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and the Surface connector. It’s great that Microsoft is finally embracing Thunderbolt, which allows me to use my speedy external drive and dock with ease, but it’s frustrating that this computer, aimed at creators, lacks an SD card slot or any other I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMe0F0"&gt;Like other Surface computers, the Laptop Studio’s keyboard is very good. It’s got 1.3mm of travel, is comfortably spaced, has a backlight, and is generally just very nice to type on. It’s closer to the keyboard in the standard Surface Laptop than the Surface Book’s, but I have zero complaints with it. Similarly, the new trackpad, which has a haptic system similar to what Apple uses on MacBooks, is large and very accurate. Clicking is easy no matter where I press; scrolling and multi-finger gestures are buttery smooth; and palm rejection is excellent. It’s perhaps the best trackpad on any Windows laptop right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1pyAgG7wTFkfro9wUxW9B-aLdjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910039/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The underside of the Laptop Studio has a unique platform that provides room for the components and cooling systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="b8skE2"&gt;The Laptop Studio is available in a handful of configurations, starting with an Intel 11th Gen Core i5 processor and integrated Intel Xe graphics. Most customers will likely want to upgrade to the discrete Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti graphics option, which starts at $2,099.99 and includes an upgrade to the Core i7-11370H processor. My review unit has the Core i7 chip, the Nvidia GPU, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage and costs a staggering $2,699.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="6lIXu3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10796774"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vd9Cbk"&gt;There’s no getting around it: that is a lot of money for what amounts to midrange performance. The processor is a 35W quad-core chip, not the six- or eight-core processors found in competitors like the XPS 15 or gaming-focused laptops that use AMD Ryzen chips. The RTX 3050 Ti is a midrange GPU that can work for casual gaming but isn’t powerful enough to really take advantage of the Laptop Studio’s fast refresh screen in modern titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgCYx1"&gt;Microsoft says the Laptop Studio is good for “weekend gamers,” which translates to “gaming is not really what it’s designed for.” I ran a battery of gaming tests on it anyway and the results were exactly what you might expect from this level of hardware. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;managed 28 frames per second at the Studio’s native resolution and all the eye candy turned on. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; pulled 42fps at native res and details cranked up, thanks to the help of Nvidia’s DLSS tech (set to Auto mode). Even when lowering the resolution to 1920 x 1440, the Laptop Studio only eked out a couple frames more per second in either of those demanding games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nN5g0f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt; managed just 38fps at native resolution and ultra settings, while &lt;em&gt;Fornite&lt;/em&gt; on epic mode averaged 40fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQO4Jv"&gt;Lighter fare, such as &lt;em&gt;Civ VI&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, is able to run at much higher frame rates, but the gist is that you’ll want to utilize DLSS as much as you can and be willing to turn down both resolution and detail settings in your games to get the best experience. When I set &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; to 1080p resolution and medium graphics, I saw a stable 97fps, which was a great experience (and still looked quite pretty, as well). Running &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; at native resolution with details set to high produced a much more playable 75 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bazEQw"&gt;The Laptop Studio may not be the best choice for gaming, but it does hold its own for creative work. It was able to export a five-minute, 33 second 4K video from Adobe Premiere Pro in five minutes and 35 seconds, about the same as an M1 MacBook Pro, but not as speedy as other laptops with more powerful graphics cards. In the PugetBench test, which runs Premiere Pro through a number of tasks to simulate actual editing work, the Laptop Studio scored 427, a bit lower than Razer’s &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=44616"&gt;Blade 14 that scored 593&lt;/a&gt; or a well-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=55564"&gt;Dell XPS 15’s score of 665&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those computers are also considerably less expensive than the Laptop Studio when outfitted with similar amounts of RAM and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gHRzU"&gt;The Studio’s cooling system did a good job no matter what tasks were thrown at the computer. It kept temps low enough to prevent throttling, and though I could feel warmth under my palms in the deck, it never got uncomfortably hot. The older Surface Books had problems staying charged when playing games for long periods due to underpowered power supplies — Daniel Rubino noted in his &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio review on &lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it suffers from a similar problem. If you plan on gaming a lot, you might want to pick up the 127W charger from the Book 3, which Rubino says solved the power drain problem on his Laptop Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6sbgv"&gt;In typical productivity work, the Laptop Studio had no problems juggling many browser tabs, multiple virtual desktops, Slack, Zoom, email, and other daily work apps at the same time. I did initially experience some bad lag when moving windows around while on battery power, but a hard restart (holding the power button down for 15 seconds) appeared to resolve that, and I didn’t see it again during my testing. It’s not quite as snappy as an M1 MacBook Pro for this kind of multitasking, especially when it’s unplugged, but it’s not a frustratingly slow experience either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0TvTS"&gt;Unplugging the Laptop Studio from power &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; where you’ll see the biggest problem with it, though. Under my normal usage, I averaged less than five hours per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwiTzH"&gt;My normal workload is not that intense either. It includes the usual array of many browser tabs in Edge, Slack, email, Spotify, Twitter, Evernote, and a few other apps running across three virtual desktops and the display at 50 percent brightness. Five hours is less than virtually every other productivity-focused laptop you can buy now lasts, and considerably less stamina than the Surface Book 3 showed. Even some gaming laptops are lasting hours longer on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BP3onj"&gt;There are a couple reasons for this: the Laptop Studio’s 58 watt-hour battery is much smaller than the 15-inch Book 3’s 80 watt-hour cell, and Windows 11 doesn’t yet support the Dynamic Refresh Rate mode that was part of the original announcement. That means the 120Hz screen is running at 120Hz all the time, which consumes more power. You can dive deep into the display settings to set it to 60Hz, but even when doing that I only managed to eke out another hour of battery life. Dynamic Refresh Rate would allow the screen to automatically change its refresh rate depending on what you’re doing, which should theoretically save battery. Sadly, Microsoft has not said when it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3--zCti2BD8fRC7Iq_lLwsbX6M8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909934/microsoft_surface_laptop_studio_4795_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thunderbolt 4 ports allow the Laptop Studio to work with Thunderbolt docks and accessories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MY27d4"&gt;It’s a perennial game among laptop reviewers to try to figure out exactly for whom Microsoft designs its Surface computers. The company’s marketing often shows off the computers in minimally decorated art studios with hip designers painstakingly crafting lines on the screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZmuV4"&gt;But the reality is that the market for digital artists is actually quite small, and the majority of people who are looking at a Laptop Studio or any of Microsoft’s computers are likely doing so for a different reason. Perhaps they are a video or photo creative pining for a MacBook-like computer that runs Windows and the offerings from Dell and HP just aren’t cutting it. Maybe they’re a Microsoft super fan who wants to buy into the company’s vision of what the future of computing might be, no matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkSLcr"&gt;Those people have often been let down by the Surface line, either because the Surface Pro or standard Surface Laptop didn’t provide enough performance for their needs or the Surface Book had just too many compromises in the name of drawing to make it practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80syrA"&gt;The Laptop Studio is perhaps the most appealing computer for them, then. Its list of compromises is much shorter — really, it’s the high sticker price and poor battery life and not much else — and it’s an enjoyable computer to use, even if you never draw a single digital brushstroke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wODcWY"&gt;Still, even if you’re Microsoft’s ideal customer, you need to give up a lot of money and battery life to get this screen with all its flexibility. But if you’re willing to be flexible yourself, and don’t really need a screen that moves in unique ways, the Dell XPS 15 is a lovely computer that costs a bit less while providing a bit more power.&lt;/p&gt;
